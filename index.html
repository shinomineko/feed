In a statement posted to the official website, Rocksteady said it could &quot;hear and feel your frustration&quot; about the ongoing issues, and agreed it was &quot;unacceptable for the players&quot; affected by the persistent problems, but said that because the issues didn&#x27;t stem from one particular issue, it was &quot;several smaller issues affecting players in different ways&quot;.
&quot;For our upcoming patches we are looking to address login issues and server issues,&quot; the statement, signed &quot;Axel and the Rocksteady Team&quot; said. &quot;And while we might not be able to fix all of those issues right away, I want to assure everyone: This is the top priority for us. We hear and feel your frustration and we can only agree, it’s unacceptable for the players who are affected by this.

                              <span>Over 700 unionised Ubisoft employees working across the company&#x27;s French studios have taken part in an organised day of strike action after annual salary negotiations collapsed.


The strike, organised by French game workers union STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo), took place on 14th February across Ubisoft&#x27;s Paris, Montpellier, Annecy, Lyon, and Bordeaux studios. The STJV had called for action at the start of this month, saying annual salary negotiations had reached an unsatisfactory conclusion.


&quot;In recent weeks,&quot; the STJV wrote in a statement shared at the time, &quot;Mandatory Annual Negotiations on salaries have taken place in several Ubisoft entities in France, and the STJV was obviously present. Despite concerted efforts by union organisations to find an acceptable compromise, negotiations hit a wall.&quot;

                              <span>A report claiming Nintendo Switch 2 will now launch in Q1 2025 is spreading online. 


Brazilian games journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe has stated Nintendo is now looking to release its next console in early 2025, though still within the 2024 financial year. The report is based on development sources now targeting that quarter for launch.


Eurogamer has heard similar whispers of an early 2025 launch from industry sources this week, though has not been able to concretely substantiate them. Nintendo Switch 2 had previously been widely tipped to arrive later this year. A move to the other side of Christmas into early 2025 would mean more time for the console&#x27;s launch line-up to be readied, while keeping the financial benefit of Switch 2&#x27;s launch within Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming financial calendar.

Writing in a post shared on Steam, Pocketpair admitted that, while the studio has been &quot;dealing with each issue on a daily basis and taking measures&quot;, there are &quot;many cases where we are not able to keep up&quot; with cheating and fraudulent activities - leading, it acknowledged, to &quot;some players [being] unable to play the game properly.&quot;


Pocketpair apologised for &quot;any inconvenience this may cause&quot; and - expanding on a recent tweet promising a cheating-related patch &quot;soon&quot; - revealed it&#x27;s currently working on a number of specific measures to deal with cheating and fraudulent activity &quot;strictly and as a priority&quot;.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft&#x27;s business update that brought us confirmation Xbox will launch four console exclusives - for now - on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.
But why did Microsoft choose not to name those four games (even though Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Grounded and Sea of Thieves were immediately reported to be the titles in question)? What happened to the previously-reported plans to include larger games such as Starfield? And where will Microsoft draw the line for what to launch elsewhere? Right now, these four feel like something of a soft launch for Microsoft&#x27;s multiplatform strategy, 
As well as all that, we also discuss the news nuggets Microsoft dropped for the Xbox faithful - including mention of new Xbox console hardware this year and the proper next-gen Xbox that&#x27;s still years away. With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>One of the three upcoming Star Wars games in development at Apex Legends and Titanfall studio Respawn is reportedly a bounty hunter game where you play as a Mandalorian. 


That&#x27;s according to Insider Gaming, which said the project was still in the early stages of development, but was a first-person shooter starring a Mandalorian bounty hunter during the time of the Galactic Empire.


The report stops short of confirming the Mandalorian bounty hunter as Din Djarin, star of Disney+ hit TV series and upcoming Mandalorian movie. A time period set during the height of the Galactic Empire would also place the game prior to the TV series - making a Baby Yoda appearance unlikely.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed it cancelled development of &quot;at least&quot; five projects following a review to implement &quot;stricter standards&quot; and an &quot;emphasis on quality&quot; in its upcoming games.
The information comes from the company&#x27;s latest financial report for Q3 of FY2024, which  contained changes to its projections of profits and sales for the full fiscal year.
The Tekken 8 and Elden Ring publisher lowered its projections for profits due to &quot;valuation losses&quot;. These losses include &quot;loss on disposal of titles following a review of the composition of the titles within the next mid-term plan in mind&quot;, the company stated in its report.

The store&#x27;s launch will also herald the return of Fortnite to iPhones, years after its previous version was locked down after Epic Games added the abililty to make direct in-game payments, circumventing Apple&#x27;s standard 33 percent cut.

Patch 6 has been teased by Larian Studios since last week, when we learned it would include more kissing animations and easier party management, but we didn&#x27;t know when it would be rolling out - or everything else it would contain.

                              <span>A Tomb Raider fan and modder has revealed that they put their own personal projects on hold for a very good reason: they have actually been leading the development of Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered.


XProger is the brains behind OpenLara, an open-source cross-platform engine of the classic Tomb Raider series. However, this project and others are now on hold, as XProger was scooped up by Aspyr&#x27;s parent company Saber Interactive to work on its official Tomb Raider project.


&quot;For the past year I&#x27;ve been busy with a dream project that has become the culmination of the last eight years of my life - Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered,&quot; XProger shared on X, thanking Saber for &quot;trusting me to lead the project and assemble a dream team of true fans&quot;.

                              <span>Payday 3 will finally be getting an offline mode - although we don&#x27;t know exactly when.
Payday 3 hasn&#x27;t exactly had the best of launches. It was plagued with matchmaking issues and online-only requirements on release, and subsequent patches were delayed. All this lead to developer Starbreeze admitting that sales and player activity were lower than it had hoped, but it would endeavour to turn this around with a series of prioritised improvements.
Now, we know more about what these upcoming improvements will be, thanks to the reveal of Operation Medic Bag. Here, the developer announced that an offline mode is coming to Payday 3, as well an overhaul to matchmaking (Starbreeze admitted that right now, &quot;matchmaking isn&#x27;t doing a good job of bringing people together&quot;), tweaks to the UI, a solo mode and a quickplay option. Additionally, &quot;challenges will be removed&quot;, with the developer stating it will &quot;switch infamy progression to be tied to heist completion&quot;.

In a thread posted on X, Pilestedt reflected on the changes developer Arrowhead Game Studios has made since Helldivers 2 released to huge success on 8th February for PC and PlayStation 5.
&quot;I am completely exhausted by the success,&quot; he stated, but &quot;very, very pleased.&quot;

                              <span>As Microsoft opts to launch at least some of its Xbox exclusives on rival consoles, the company&#x27;s gaming boss Phil Spencer has reflected on Sony&#x27;s recent, hugely-successful launch of online, cross-platform shooter Helldivers 2 on PC and PlayStation 5.


&quot;I will say, when I look at a game like Helldivers 2 - and it&#x27;s a great game, kudos to the team shipping on PC and PlayStation - I&#x27;m not exactly sure who it helps in the industry by not being on Xbox,&quot; Spencer told Game File. &quot;If you try to twist yourself to say, like, somehow that benefited somebody somewhere.


&quot;But I get it. There&#x27;s a legacy in console gaming that we&#x27;re going to benefit by shipping games and not putting them on other places. We do the same thing.&quot;

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is developer Remedy&#x27;s fastest-selling game to date, but the studio is still to recuperate the project&#x27;s development and marketing costs. 


In its latest financial report, Remedy said Alan Wake 2 had now sold 1.3m units, with 1m of those occurring by the end of last year. This equates to 50 percent more copies and over three times more digital copies of Alan Wake 2 sold in the game&#x27;s first two months than its previous release Control managed in its first four months (though it&#x27;s worth noting Alan Wake 2 was a digital-only release).


Control has since gone on to sell over 4m units, and Remedy said it expected a similar trend with Alan Wake 2, as &quot;a great game can generate excellent long tail sales&quot;. But, of course, games lose value over time - so copies sold after prices drop generate less revenue than at launch.

                              <span>Microsoft has shared updated Game Pass membership figures for the first time since January 2022, saying the on-demand gaming service now has 34m &quot;fully paid&quot; subscribers, with &quot;significant growth&quot; coming from PC and cloud.


That update comes via Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer, speaking to journalist Stephen Totilo for his Game File newsletter (thanks VGC) ahead of this week&#x27;s hotly anticipated Xbox &#x27;business update&#x27; podcast - in which the company finally discussed its much rumoured plans to bring a number of its formerly Xbox-exclusive first-party games to PS5 and Switch.


Discussing Microsoft&#x27;s latest Game Pass figures, Spencer assured Totilo the 9m subscribers added to the service since January 2022 - when Microsoft announced Game Pass had amassed a total of 25m members - were &quot;fully paid&quot; and did not include promotional players. &quot;Those are people,&quot; Spencer reiterated, &quot;fully paid subs.&quot;

That&#x27;s according to Xbox president Sarah Bond, who was speaking on an &quot;Updates on the Xbox Business&quot; edition of the Official Xbox Podcast, alongside Microsoft Gaming boss Phill Spencer and head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty.


According to Bond, Microsoft has hardware plans for Xbox in both the short and longer term. Starting this &quot;holiday&quot;, for instance, Microsoft will share &quot;some exciting stuff coming out in hardware&quot;. An official Xbox tweet accompanying today&#x27;s podcast expanded on Bond&#x27;s comments, saying Microsoft currently has a &quot;robust and innovative multi-year hardware roadmap&quot; that&#x27;ll include &quot;more console and controller options...this holiday.

                              <span>Diablo 4 is coming to Game Pass this March.


Xbox&#x27;s Sarah Bond made the announcement this evening, as part of the company&#x27;s business update podcast. 
In a follow up post on social media, Xbox said Diablo 4&#x27;s upcoming Game Pass debut is part of Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;promise to offer Activision Blizzard games&quot; on the subscription service, following its acquisition of the Diablo and Call of Duty makers last year.

                              <span>Following mounting reports Xbox is preparing for some kind of multiplatform future, Microsoft has confirmed it&#x27;ll be bringing four previously Xbox-exclusive first-party titles to PlayStation 5 and Switch later this year, with more likely to come in the future.


Reports that Microsoft was preparing to release a number of first-party games on competing consoles - namely Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush - first surfaced at the start of this year, but it wasn&#x27;t until last week&#x27;s claims high-profile exclusives such as Starfield and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would also be going multiplatform that Microsoft broke its silence, promising to reveal more in a podcast this week.


And now, as reported by The Verge - which was pre-briefed by Microsoft ahead of tonight&#x27;s reveal - Xbox gaming boss Phil Spencer has confirmed the company has &quot;made the decision that we&#x27;re going to take four games to the other consoles&quot;. Bafflingly, Spencer does not name the games directly, only saying two are community-driven titles and two are smaller games.

                              <span>Welcome to our live coverage of the big Xbox business update, where Microsoft laid out its plan to launch four first-party Xbox games on Nintendo and PlayStation platforms. 


Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer, Xbox president Sarah Bond and head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty - the company&#x27;s Triforce of gaming top brass - stopped short of officially confirming the quartet of titles set to go multiplatform, but reports online suggest those titles will be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves and Grounded.

The podcast also included a brief mention of new Xbox hardware launching later this year, and a tease for the proper next-gen Xbox - you can read all of that below.

                              <span>Post-apocalyptic RPG fans are in luck; the next batch of freebies coming to the Epic Games Store have been revealed, and two bonafide RPG classes - Fallout and Fallout 2 - have made the list alongside Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel.


Fallout 1 and 2, developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997 and 1998 respectively, have amassed a fiercely passionate following over the years, and with good reason. &quot;From the unrelentingly bleak, darkly ironic tone to the novelty of the open-world, post-apocalyptic setting,&quot; Eurogamer wrote in 2011, &quot;from the inspired, cerebral turn-based combat system to the immense degree of variety and personality in the character-customisation, the superbly-written quests and characters and the gallows humour that underpins the games without lessening their emotional impact, even the well-placed, gritty violence; there&#x27;s very little about the games that doesn&#x27;t command as much respect now as they did a decade ago.&quot;


As for Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, released in 2001, it&#x27;s less widely revered, but still a decently enjoyable time, infusing the post-apocalyptic isometric wasteland setting of its illustrious RPG predecessors with squad-based combat action. And its inclusion means next week&#x27;s Epic Games Store freebies list is as follows:

                              <span>A quarter of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM&#x27;s total workforce - approximately 24 employees - is reportedly facing redundancy following the cancellation of a standalone expansion for acclaimed RPG Disco Elysium, said to be &quot;one to two years away from completion&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to Swedish gaming content agency GLHF, which claims the cancelled expansion - codenamed X7 - was the third project to have either been canned or paused indefinitely by ZA/UM in as many years. A Disco Elysium sequel was reportedly cancelled in 2022 (complicating the claim, ZA/UM CEO was still talking about the project in June 2023, albeit saying it had been &quot;jeopardised&quot; following a messy tussle with its former creative leads), while a new sci-fi IP is said to have been paused in 2023.


GLHF, citing &quot;sources close to the matter&quot;, says 24 employees at ZA/UM are now at risk of redundancy following X7&#x27;s cancellation, with the job losses mostly affecting &quot;the X7 team but also [its] non-development teams and non-X7 projects.&quot; Redundancies are set to impact employees in ZA/UM&#x27;s UK offices as well as its EU studio, with writers, engineers, artists, animators, and staff in production and IT all affected.

                              <span>When Forever Skies leaves PC early access later this year, it will also arrive on PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive.


Developer Far From Home has been &quot;secretly&quot; working alongside Sony for several years on its rather intriguing looking game of airships and survival. While the Forever Skies team is yet to set a date for this release, merely stating it will be some time in 2024, it has promised a same day launch for both PC and PS5. 


Along with this news, the studio has shared a new trailer for Forever Skies, showing off the latest in-game footage. You can have a watch for yourself below.

                              <span>Xbox has rolled out a new update for February, adding touch controls in remote play and more.
With this update in action, users will be able to play games without being tied to their console even if they don&#x27;t have a wireless controller to hand. This is as Xbox remote play now supports custom touch control layouts on the Xbox app (via iOS, Android and Windows devices) for over 100 games.
&quot;The same custom touch layouts available through Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) will now be available when remotely playing games from your personal console,&quot; Microsoft said. &quot;This includes games like Minecraft Dungeons, Psychonauts 2, Sea of Thieves, and many more. Additionally, a basic touch control layout can now be used for most other games.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s been fairly quiet on the No Man&#x27;s Sky front since its previous big update, Echoes, introduced the world to a mysterious new robot race known as the Autophages last August, but all that changes today with the release of its new Omega update - which coincides with a first-ever free weekend for the exploratory space sim on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.


No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s Omega update introduces a handful of new core features, including on-planet missions. These procedurally generated quests can be initiated by speaking to alien lifeforms Travellers find roaming around on planet surfaces, and are assembled based on a number of factors, including locale, climate, and alien personality.


Elsewhere, the update makes it possible to captain an imposing Dreadnought capital ship - previously they existed mainly to be blown up - but this first requires a spot of successful space combat; players will need to defeat the pirate freighters surrounding a hostile Dreadnought during an encounter before they&#x27;re able to board it and take control.

                              <span>Making good on their word, People Can Fly and Incuvo have released a rather chunky patch for Bulletstorm VR on PlayStation VR2 and Steam VR. This follows an earlier update on Meta Quest sets, which took aim at crashes and more.
Bulletstorm VR had a broken release earlier this year, with players complaining about the port&#x27;s botched physics and censorship, among other issues. Back in January, the team subsequently said it was &quot;committed to improving the quality&quot; of its release, and would be prioritising fixes based on their severity.
This new patch will provide fixes for multiple crashes and bugs, as well as improving the AI on select enemies. Other quality of life improvements, such as holding down the trigger to automatically skip a cinematic, have also been added.

                              <span>Following a rocky launch, Payday 3 developer Starbreeze said its sales and player activity are &quot;currently at significantly lower levels than [it] would like&quot;. However, the studio hopes to turn this around in the future, stating it will focus efforts &quot;to ensure that the game lives up to expectations&quot; for players.  
The developer noted there have been other examples of games that have successfully turned a &quot;problematic initial time on the market&quot; into a &quot;long-term success&quot; story. While Starbreeze did not mention any names, Cyberpunk 2077 came to my mind.
&quot;There is no simple recipe available, but a common thread from the positive examples is to take players&#x27; criticism to heart, dare to support your game and keeping an open and honest dialogue with your stakeholders,&quot; Starbreeze said in its year-end report. &quot;That is exactly what we are now doing with Payday 3.&quot;

The game&#x27;s creative director and Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt responded to a fan requesting the addition of a PvP mode to keep &quot;hardcore gamers engaged&quot;.


&quot;We&#x27;ll &#x27;never&#x27; add a PvP-mode. This is to reduce toxic elements from the community,&quot; said Pilestedt. &quot;We want an environment that&#x27;s supportive, fun and where we all are fighting on the same side!&quot;

These words come ahead of Microsoft&#x27;s business update later today, in which the company is expected to lay out its plans to publish some Xbox games on PlayStation and Nintendo platforms.


Bond was speaking at an internal town hall meeting, with several sources telling Inverse the exec went on to discuss Xbox&#x27;s strategy of existing on multiple devices. She also spoke more on the company&#x27;s ambitions to become the number one cross-platform gaming company, the sources said. 


To illustrate this point, staff were shown images of this year&#x27;s breakout hit Palworld across multiple screens. This included &quot;tablets, TV screens, monitors, and handheld devices&quot;, the publication said.

The company released its latest financial report today, stating its net sales increased by 4 percent, though this is largely thanks to its Tabletop Games and Entertainment divisions. PC and console games net sales decreased by five percent.


In its third quarter, the company laid off 483 people, meaning 1387 employees have now lost their jobs in the last two quarters, representing 8 percent of the total workforce.

Headquarted in Paris, the company released action role-player Banishers: Ghosts of Eden this week, following last year&#x27;s  well-received Jusant and Harmony: The Fall of Reverie.


Now, a report by French union Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV) has alleged that staff at Don&#x27;t Nod are subject to mismanagement by the company due to the need to balance multiple projects with &quot;frequently&quot; changing deadlines, &quot;contradictory&quot; directions and &quot;no long-term vision&quot; for staff welfare.

Totoki made the comments during an investor Q&amp;A coinciding with its latest financial earnings report. When asked how Sony&#x27;s gaming division might be looking to increase profits, he first discussed the difficulty of cost reduction in PlayStation hardware, given component pricing, before highlighting a &quot;multiplatform&quot; approach to its first-party game releases as a potentially more fruitful area of expansion.


&quot;In the past, as you all know,&quot; Totoki explained, &quot;we wanted to popularise [our] console, and the first-party title&#x27;s main purpose was to make the console popular.&quot;

Despite some early technical woes, which Arrowhead has been hard at work trying resolve since Friday&#x27;s release on PlayStation 5 and PC, Helldivers 2 has enjoyed a positive critical reception and strong player numbers, even becoming PlayStation Studios&#x27; biggest Steam launch to date as it amassed over 150,000 concurrents this weekend.


Amid that early success, Arrowhead CEO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt has taken to social media on a recruitment drive, seeking out &quot;more amazing developers&quot; who can &quot;help [the studio] accelerate and beef up our content plans&quot;.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company is bringing its hugely popular Pokémon Center pop-up store back to London for four days this April, with promise of more exclusive Pokémon merchandise.


The Pokémon Center&#x27;s return to the UK coincides with this year&#x27;s Pokémon Europe International Championships, which take place at ExCeL London from 4th to 7th April. The store will be open at the venue from 10am to 8pm every day except Sunday, when it&#x27;s set to close at 4pm.


Previous Pokémon Center pop-ups in the UK have attracted huge crowds, and The Pokémon Company is clearly expecting similar attention this time around. It notes that while entry to the store is open to the general public and won&#x27;t require a competitor or spectator badge, reservations are mandatory - even for badged attendees. More information on the reservation process is set to be shared &quot;closer to the event&quot;.

                              <span>Sony has unveiled its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium game catalogue additions for February, which this month include Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, Need for Speed Unbound, The Outer Worlds, Tales of Arise, and more.


Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is arguably the biggest biggie in there, whisking players away for a Viking adventure set against an open-world backdrop of Anglo-Saxon England at the end of the ninth century. A lavishly designed &quot;saga for the ages&quot;, is what Eurogamer called it back in 2020.


Valhalla is joined by the developer Criterion&#x27;s equally recommended arcade racer Need for Speed Unbound - the &quot;best Need for Speed in a generation&quot; we said when it released in 2022 - as well as Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s slightly less gripping 2019 satirical adventure The Outer Worlds, a &quot;conventional, easygoing scifi RPG...that fades very quickly from the mind.&quot; And here&#x27;s the full list of February&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Extra games.

                              <span>Good essay on software bloat and the insecurities it causes.
The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this, there is a huge attack surface full of mediocre code. Efforts are ongoing to improve the quality of code itself, but many exploits are due to logic fails, and less progress has been made scanning for those. Meanwhile, great strides could be made by paring down just how much code we expose to the world. This will increase time to market for products, but legislation is around the corner that should force vendors to take security more seriously...</span>

                              <span>Arrowhead has released another patch for Helldivers 2 and it&#x27;s good news for those incredibly popular players among us - the game will no longer crash if you have too many friends.
This patch - Patch 01.000.006 to give it its full name - also addresses those crashes that could occur during the extraction cutscene and when users disconnect during the joining cutscene.
Along with stability fixes, this patch also improves matchmaking experiences.

                              <span>The Sims 4 has partnered with model Winnie Harlow and added a range of Vitiligo skin details to the game as part of a free update. 


Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. This is caused by a lack of melanin, the pigment in skin. Sims 4 players will now be able to customise their Sims with Vitiligo skin details, with patches for the face, upper torso, lower torso, arms, and legs now available in the Create-A-Sim menu. 


These details are available for Sims of all ages, from infants to elders. Several Vitiligo patterns will have &quot;more than one variant&quot;, the Sims team said, calling skin details an &quot;important area of focus for the dev team as we remain committed to expanding representation in The Sims 4&quot;. Other skin features already in the game include birthmarks, stretch marks, scars, and freckles.

That means no new entry in the God of War or Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man franchises until at least April 2025, according to Sony president Hiroki Totoki. 


Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, currently listed with a vague &quot;2025&quot; release date, will therefore launch later than March. Don&#x27;t expect to see other big PlayStation properties such as Uncharted, The Last of Us, Ratchet &amp; Clank or Horizon before then, either. It&#x27;s also unclear where a potential Ghost of Tsushima sequel fits in.

In a new thread on X, Larian revealed Patch 6 has &quot;more than just romance&quot; and will add bug fixes and some gameplay improvements which should help make party management much easier.

                              <span>Sony had a record quarter for PlayStation sales and revenue, but expects console sales to decline in the next fiscal year.


According to its latest financial report, Sony sold a further 8.2m PlayStation 5 consoles, bringing its lifetime total to 54.7m. That&#x27;s 16.4m consoles sold this financial year so far.


However, Sony has dropped its expected sales forecast across its gaming segment for the year by five percent, due to an expected decrease in hardware sales and increase in losses due to promotions.

                              <span>Bloober Team&#x27;s CEO has said he understands the critism around the recent Silent Hill 2 Remake trailer, which didn&#x27;t &quot;capture the spirit of the game&quot;.
The trailer in question was a combat-focused marketing beat by publisher Konami, and as Matt said at the time, combat is not exactly the first thing you think of when you think of Silent Hill 2. It probably isn&#x27;t even the second or third. And yet, this was what Konami decided to hone in on during PlayStation&#x27;s recent State of Play.
However, reactions afterwards weren&#x27;t exactly enthusiastic. &quot;The nurse vaulting over the wall like it&#x27;s a tactical shooter is hilarious,&quot; one comment under the original trailer reads. Another remarked the game looks more like it&#x27;s from 2014, than 2024. Others said it looked more like a fan-made remake.

                              <span>Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered begins with a content warning that explains the trilogy contains &quot;offensive depictions of people and cultures rooted in racial and ethnic prejudices&quot;. 


The message states that these depictions are &quot;inexcusable&quot; but have been kept intact to acknowledge their &quot;deeply harmful&quot; inclusion and learn from it.


There&#x27;s no detail in the statement on which specific elements of the games it refers to - though one likely example can be found in Tomb Raider 3, Eurogamer fans of the games tell me, where stereotypical South Pacific islanders attack Lara Croft with bows and arrows.

                              <span>The winner of the Best Paper Award at Crypto this year was a significant improvement to lattice-based cryptanalysis.
This is important, because a bunch of NIST’s post-quantum options base their security on lattice problems.
I worry about standardizing on post-quantum algorithms too quickly. We are still learning a lot about the security of these systems, and this paper is an example of that learning.

But—and this is the real reason I am posting this—Amazon has significantly discounted the hardcover to $15 to get rid of its stock. This is much cheaper than I am selling it for, and cheaper even than the paperback. So if you’ve been waiting for a price drop, this is your chance.</span>

Its apparent absence had been hotly debated by fans, though has now been confirmed to Eurogamer by developer Niantic. It means Go Tour: Sinnoh will be the first one of Pokémon Go&#x27;s popular annual Tour events not to let players complete their Pokédex for the corresponding region.


Two other Sinnoh species will also be absent: Mythical creatures Manaphy and Phione.

The BS F-Zero Grand Prix games were first made available in a series of broadcasts in 1996 and 1997, including remixed courses from the original SNES game and some exclusive tracks too.


However, these games appeared to be lost in the mute city of time - until now.

                              <span>A mobile version of hit survival horror Lethal Company has popped up on the iPhone App Store and Google Play - but isn&#x27;t what it seems. The game&#x27;s developer Zeekerss has warned players this is &quot;likely a scam of some sort&quot;, and not made with its permission.


Lethal Company has become incredibly popular since its debut last year, and prompted praise for the game&#x27;s mix of genuine horror and almost slapstick comedy. Now, it appears others are trying to profit off Zeekerss&#x27; success by releasing their own rip-off of Lethal Company on mobile. Don&#x27;t be fooled.


Writing on the Lethal Company Discord, a moderator stated this mobile version &quot;was made with no explicit permission and is most likely a scam&quot;. They asked users to refrain from linking to any fake games, to avoid anyone falling foul of &quot;devious and malicious intentions that may be behind that operation&quot;.

Now, Benard has shared an update with further thoughts on his blog, in a bid to shed more light on his previous words.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox and PC exclusive Pentiment will make its way to PS5 and Nintendo Switch, alongside the previously-leaked Hi-Fi Rush.


That&#x27;s according to a new report from The Verge ahead of Thursday&#x27;s podcast from Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer, Xbox president Sarah Bond and head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty, where the trio will reveal Xbox&#x27;s new business strategy - including, it&#x27;s believed, the launch of exclusive games on rival platforms.



Sources confirmed to The Verge that Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment will be the first two games on the way, with Sea of Thieves planned for later this year. Other first-party titles are simply described as being under consideration.

                              <span>The Thaumaturge will now launch slightly later than planned, on 4th March, despite work on the game being complete. 


Writing on social media today, publisher 11 Bit Studios said it had actively chosen to delay the game due to &quot;February&#x27;s busy launch period&quot;. This month&#x27;s releases include Ubisoft&#x27;s Skull and Bones (on the 16th) and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (on the 29th). 


&quot;The game is complete, but we want to give it space so it can be enjoyed the way we believe it deserves,&quot; the publisher wrote in a post on X. &quot;See you in 1905 Warsaw and thank you for your patience!&quot;

                              <span>Molly White—of “Web3 is Going Just Great” fame—reviews Chris Dixon’s blockchain solutions book: Read Write Own:
In fact, throughout the entire book, Dixon fails to identify a single blockchain project that has successfully provided a non-speculative service at any kind of scale. The closest he ever comes is when he speaks of how “for decades, technologists have dreamed of building a grassroots internet access provider”. He describes one project that “got further than anyone else”: Helium. He’s right, as long as you ignore the fact that Helium was providing LoRaWAN, not Internet, that by the time he was writing his book Helium hotspots had long since passed the phase where they might generate even enough tokens for their operators to merely break even, and that the network was pulling in somewhere around $1,150 in usage fees a month despite the company being valued at $1.2 billion. Oh, and that the company had widely lied to the public about its supposed big-name clients, and that its executives have been accused of hoarding the project’s token to enrich themselves. But hey, a16z sunk millions into Helium (a fact Dixon never mentions), so might as well try to drum up some new interest!...</span>

Wells&#x27; TikTok account, which he created last Friday, now has over 17m views - mostly on his first video, where he reveals himself as the voice of video gaming&#x27;s PEGI logos.


Yes, Wells voiced the &quot;PEGI 12&quot; and &quot;PEGI 18&quot; logos that play before video game trailers - and now, he&#x27;s told fans he was only paid €200 (£170) years ago to do it.

                              <span>Former lead designer and developer on Dead Cells Sébastien Benard has called the decision to end development on the game &quot;the worst imaginable asshole move&quot; by publisher Motion Twin.
Benard worked on Dead Cells until late 2019, before establishing his own one-man studio called Deepnight. Now, he&#x27;s posted his thoughts on Dead Cells&#x27; development being ended on the game&#x27;s Discord server, after being asked for his opinion (as spotted by PCGamesN).
After a quick check by Eurogamer, Benard&#x27;s posts no longer seem to be available on the server at the time of writing, though many users are still discussing what he wrote.

Rocksteady became aware of the bug when players began reaching Mastery Levels during the postgame &quot;beyond our wildest expectations&quot;, the developer said on the Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Discord server.
&quot;As Mastery levels increased, Burn&#x27;s damage also increased,&quot; Rocksteady explained, adding this was not &quot;what the game was balanced for at launch&quot;. The developer is fixing the scaling bug, it said, and once the fix is in place a new leaderboard will begin.

The news has come as a surprise to many Fortnite fans expecting David Tennant and current TARDIS incumbent Ncuti Gatwa to both stroll into Fortnite&#x27;s metaverse sometime in the near future.

                              <span>The demo for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has been out a week and, beyond sharing piano covers, now players are arguing about yellow paint.


It&#x27;s a familiar trope in many video games: essentially, developers indicate the correct path by adding bright yellow paint to scalable ledges and ladders.


It&#x27;s also a debate that has raged for years. When the Resident Evil 4 remake demo was released, players complained about yellow paint being used on breakable objects. Now the discourse has erupted again.

The sentiment was relayed in a note posted on Steam following server maintenance yesterday, in which the developer released three &quot;rapid-fixes&quot;. The issues addressed during maintenance were related to logins, server capacity, and progression and rewards.
However, the issues haven&#x27;t been fully resolved and Arrowhead said it is &quot;doing our utmost to make it right&quot;. &quot;In order to do so,&quot; the studio added, &quot;right now it is crucial that our team gets some sleep and we will be back at this again in a few hours&quot;.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 creative director and Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt believes games should &quot;earn the right to monetise&quot;, adding that whilst players are welcome to &quot;support this title&quot; by buying microtransactions, Arrowhead is &quot;never forcing anyone to do so&quot;.
The comments come in an X/Twitter thread in which Pilestedt responded to a tweet in which a player pointed out that super credits can be earned just by &quot;playing the damn game&quot;.
&quot;We really applied ourselves to not make it [pay-to-win] even though items are functionally different,&quot; Pilestedt said (thanks, PCGN). &quot;The only item that&#x27;s [pay-to-win] is the revolver – which will win you any &#x27;cool gun&#x27; competition.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard is making &quot;major changes&quot; to Overwatch 2 as part of a &quot;revitalisation&quot; of the free-to-play shooter that hopes to &quot;make PvP gameplay more rewarding and fun&quot;, as well as &quot;provide greater transparency for players in-game&quot;.
In a candid blog, the team insisted it had &quot;heard [the] feedback&quot; from players about the competitive play over the last eight seasons, and has plans to introduce &quot;big updates&quot; to enable you to better build on your skills and &quot;see how you progress through the competitive ranks&quot;.
&quot;We built a better system that’s more accurate while also helping convey the meaning behind the mathematical complexity of a modern matchmaker and bring clear insights about what impacts your rank in every match,&quot; the team said.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, developer Zeekerss says it is thinking of slowing down the rate and scope of updates in order to make them &quot;really substantial&quot; and &quot;bigger and less frequent&quot;.
In a message posted to X/Twitter, Zeekerss – pointing out that the co-op horror game is currently 30 per cent off – admitted that they were &quot;distracted by life right now&quot;, but version 50 was &quot;slowly cooking&quot;.

                              <span>The Little Mermaid&#x27;s Ariel has stopped by Disney Speedstorm, the hero-based combat racing game inspired by Disney and Pixar worlds.
Season 6, entitled Under the Sea, includes &quot;brand-new content&quot; inspired by Disney&#x27;s The Little Mermaid. As well as a new track based on the fan-favourite animated movie, Ariel, Ursula, King Triton, and Prince Eric – plus bonus racer EVE – are all new racers that each bring &quot;their own unique and powerful abilities&quot; to the line-up.
That&#x27;s not all, though. If you can&#x27;t bear the thought of being under the sea without Ariel&#x27;s friends, Flounder, Sebastian, Max, Flotsam and Jetsam, and even Scuttle are available as new crew members, too.

                              <span>Nintendo Switch 2 will be backwards compatible.
That&#x27;s according to Universo Nintendo, a Portuguese website that claims the Switch 2 will not only have backwards compatibility with Switch titles currently available on Nintendo&#x27;s handheld system, but developers will also be able to &quot;enhance&quot; these games thanks to the additional processing power.
The report – which hails from the Portuguese podcast X do Controle by PH Brazil and was shared across social media by Centro Leaks – further asserts that rumours about a Nintendo Direct coming next week are indeed true, and claims that we&#x27;ll finally have confirmation about Nintendo&#x27;s badly-kept secret system at a hardware reveal event sometimes in March.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is now Playstation&#x27;s biggest Steam launch, clocking up over 150,000 concurrent users on the PC platform over the weekend.
Until this point, Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s God of War reboot held the record with 73,529 simultaneous users, which is less than half of Helldiver 2&#x27;s current peak of 155,926.
The record was secured despite the issues that plagued the shooter&#x27;s launch, which was causing crashes and preventing some players from matchmaking with others.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has confirmed that the &quot;rapid patch&quot; the team deployed to Steam yesterday is &quot;now on PS5 as well&quot;.
The update comes after players lamented issues with matchmaking, as well as persistent crashes. There&#x27;s also been criticism of the game&#x27;s PC optimisation and its kernel-level GameGuard anti-cheat software, whilst others have taken umbrage with Helldivers 2&#x27;s monetisation.
However, game director Mikael Eriksson did admit earlier today on the game&#x27;s Discord channel that whilst &quot;a full matchmaking solution is in works&quot;, it may take &quot;a few more days&quot; to test before it can be rolled out.

                              <span>Tekken 8&#x27;s upcoming DLC characters have reportedly leaked online.
A dataminer who sifted through the game files of the fighting game claims to have uncovered the names of some of those who are appearing on the DLC roster.
Dataminer Shootmans says they &quot;confirmed and debunked several leaks&quot; during the Closed Network Test, and attests that their most recent exploration has revealed who may be coming back for the DLC.

                              <span>From Software parent company, Kadokawa, has confirmed that whilst the team is &quot;currently working hard&quot; on Elden Ring&#x27;s DLC, there is still no release date to share &quot;at this time&quot;.
It seems questions about the progress of the eagerly-anticipated DLC were anticipated, as this latest update was included in the FAQ section of the firm&#x27;s latest financial report.
Tucked in between questions about net sales for Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon (&quot;we do not disclose sales results and forecasts for individual titles&quot;) and &quot;the trend of pricing per unit for paper-based books&quot;, the company said that whilst work continued on Elden Ring&#x27;s DLC, it was unable to provide a release date just yet.

                              <span>A new report claims Nintendo Switch 2 is expected later this year and will feature a custom-made Nvidia chip.
According to Reuters, Nvidia is building an entirely new business unit to focus on designing bespoke chips for hardware firms and has designed a custom design for the next iteration of Nintendo&#x27;s handheld system.
A source told Reuters that &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia&#x27;s Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design&quot;.

                              <span>Xbox is still committed to making consoles, says boss Phil Spencer
Earlier this week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer called an all-staff townhall meeting to address the rumours suggesting that hitherto first-party Xbox games could be released on other platforms, insisting that this did not mean the company wasn&#x27;t committed to the Xbox console.
According to journalist Shannon Liao, the meeting – which was held with all internal staff on Tuesday – confirmed that the company was indeed considering bringing first-party games to &quot;multiple kinds of devices&quot;, and more would be revealed publicly next week.

In a tweet posted to the company&#x27;s Japanese-language X/Twitter account, the studio said it &quot;still has a lot to do&quot; and is looking for &quot;people in all positions&quot; who have experience in &quot;any type of engine&quot;. Specifically, however, Pocketpair would like to talk to devs with expertise in project planning and engineering.
&quot;At Palworld, we still have a lot to do, but we are overwhelmingly short of people to join us!&quot; the studio said, as translated by PC Gamer. &quot;We are looking for people for all positions, but we are especially looking for planning and engineers!

                              <span>Hideo Kojima dropped a bombshell at the end of January, announcing that - alongside development of Death Stranding 2 - he would also be returning to the action-espionage genre that put him on the map with the Metal Gear series, in the form of Physint for PlayStation 5. And now, in a new episode of his HideoTube web series, the designer has explained how a period of sickness and surgery - and thoughts of his own mortality - convinced him to &#x27;change his priorities&#x27; and do something fans had been asking him to do for years.


During the hour-long episode (thanks GameSpot), Kojima explained how, after departing Konami and establishing his independent Kojima Productions studio, he &quot;wanted to do something new with my own IP&quot; and &quot;challenge myself&quot;, leading to Death Stranding. &quot;Then, to create a franchise,&quot; he continued, &quot;I made Death Stranding 2. And I wanted to do something even newer, so I started working on OD. And since then, there have been a lot of new ideas.&quot;


However, Kojima revealed that during those eight years, &quot;Every day on social media, from users all around the world, people have been asking me to create another Metal Gear and stuff like that.&quot; But it wasn&#x27;t until he became ill in 2020, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, that those requests began to take on a more significant meaning.

                              <span>GTA 5 will soon pass the astonishing milestone of having sold 200m copies.


The game currently sits on 195m copies sold to date, with more than five million copies shifted over the past three months, publisher Take-Two revealed in its latest financial results. 


If its current momentum continues, GTA 5 will pass the 200m mark before the summer. That&#x27;s around 100m more copies sold than Tetris, and behind only Minecraft (which has sold around 300m copies, it&#x27;s believed).

                              <span>Pikachu stars in the music video for Jax Jones&#x27; new single Never Be Lonely.
The single, which features German singer-songwriter Zoe Wees, was released today and accompanied by a music video. The video is a collaboration between Jones and The Pokémon Company International, and sees Pikachu being abducted onto a UFO-turned-stadium where Jones and Wees are performing.
Pikachu isn&#x27;t that mad about being abducted though, as he happily greets the two and dances along before illuminating (or rather electrocuting) the entire stadium. Ceruledge also makes a sneaky appearance towards the beginning of the video, as a projection onto the sides of some buildings.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s live-service pirate ship game Skull and Bones is a &quot;quadruple-A&quot; project, company boss Yves Guillemot has said. 


Discussing the long-awaited project with investors last night, Guillemot justified the live service game launching with a £70 price tag as it being a fully-formed experience that was also supported by a battle pass, premium currency and an in-game store.


&quot;You will see that Skull and Bones is a full-fledged game,&quot; Guillemot said. &quot;It&#x27;s a very big game and we feel that people will really see how vast and complete that game is. So it&#x27;s a really full triple-A, quadruple-A game that will deliver in the long run.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth players are already sharing piano covers from the game&#x27;s demo, just days after its release.



The demo takes place in Nibelheim where, as Cloud, players can snoop around in Tifa&#x27;s house and play her piano - fans of the original will remember this is how you unlock her ultimate limit break.


Now, in Rebirth, the piano is freely playable in a little minigame, so players have been busy creating covers of Final Fantasy tunes and pop songs.

                              <span>The next game from Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has been delayed slightly.
No Rest for the Wicked, an isometric action-RPG with darker visuals, is a departure from the Ori games. It was revealed in December at The Game Awards, and the developer gave an early access release window on Steam of the first three months of 2024. 
However, the game&#x27;s early access launch has now been delayed to Q1 of the financial year 2025 (or Q2 of the calendar year 2024), as revealed in Take-Two&#x27;s earning report for Q3 2024.

Nexus VR isn&#x27;t mentioned at all in Ubisoft&#x27;s Q3 earnings press release, but the game was addressed by Guillemot during its conference call (as reported by VGC).

In-game calendar pages posted around the game&#x27;s Metropolis map have been spotted by Batman Arkham Videos, and verified by Eurogamer. Each features a circled date, with a hidden code that spells out a secret message.


Substituting the date marked on each calendar page (the eighth of January, for example) with the corresponding letter of the alphabet (H, the eighth letter) spells out the following phrase:  &quot;He Will Return&quot;.

                              <span>Sega has reported poor financial results for the past quarter, due to the &quot;weak&quot; performance of some recent releases.


While specific sales have not been noted in its latest report, games released in the last quarter include Sonic Superstars, Persona 5 Tactica, Total War: Pharaoh, and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.


However, its latest releases suggest a more positive quarter is on the horizon, despite the company lowering its forecast.

Details of the cost reduction program were discussed by Zelnick during Take-Two&#x27;s Q3 2024 financial report, which was released yesterday. 
During the earnings call with investors, Zelnick said Take-Two is &quot;currently working on a significant cost reduction program&quot;. A similar cost reduction program was announced by Take-Two in its third quarter report for 2023, which resulted in some layoffs last year.

Whenever GTA 6 releases, Guillemot said it will be good for the industry when questioned during the company&#x27;s Q3 earnings call yesterday.

                              <span>A fresh set of weekly freebies has now arrived on the Epic Games Store, this time in the form of acclaimed visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! and rogue-like brawling RPG Lost Castle - with Dakar Desert Racing to follow next week.


Starting with Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!, it&#x27;s the enhanced and expanded version of developer Team Salvato renowned 2017 freeware visual novel of the same name (minus the &#x27;Plus!&#x27; bit, obviously) that starts out innocently enough - with players taking on the role of a new student who can romance the anime-styled members of the titular club - before taking a metatextual turn into considerably darker territory.


If that&#x27;s not your thing - and its Epic Games Store listing makes it clear Doki Doki isn&#x27;t &quot;suitable for children or those who are easily disturbed&quot; - your other freebie option is Lost Castle. This is a &quot;super cute, super hard action RPG with roguelike elements and randomised dungeons&quot; from Hunter Studio, and it supports four-player co-op and PvP both locally and online.

                              <span>Satirical sci-fi shooter sequel Helldivers 2 has got off to a solid start on Steam, with today&#x27;s launch propelling it to the number three position on the platform&#x27;s best-sellers list, while its concurrent players have hit over 64,000 in less than a day. However, player reception has been mixed thanks to a range of issues on PC (it&#x27;s also out on PS5), and developer Arrowhead Game Studios has now responded, saying fixes are on the way.


Helldivers 2 - which follows the same co-op template as its well-received predecessor, albeit with a switch from top-down perspective to third-person - has so far settled on a Steam rating of &quot;mixed&quot; after over 5,300 reviews, with players highlighting a range of launch-day woes.


Chief among criticisms are complaints about persistent crashes, while others have singled out server and matchmaking issues. Then there&#x27;s ire directed towards PC optimisation, and its kernel-level GameGuard anti-cheat software, which some feel is cause for concern, as well as complaints around Helldivers 2&#x27;s monetisation - which includes a battle pass and premium currency in-game shop, despite the game&#x27;s £34.99/$39.99 USD price tag.

                              <span>Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds has moved to address fan concerns following publisher Krafton&#x27;s announcement that the underwater survival sequel will be a multiplayer title adopting a &quot;game-as-a-service model&quot;.


Krafton made the claims in its latest financial earnings report, which also brought the news Subnautica 2 - the third game in Unknown Worlds&#x27; series, following on from the acclaimed 2018 original and its 2021 continuation Subnautica: Below Zero - would be out this year. And with fans beginning to express displeasure at the apparent swerve away from the solo, self-contained survival action of previous Subnautica games, Unknown Worlds quickly sprung into action, offering clarification on its blog.


Starting with the multiplayer announcement, that much is apparently true, with Subnautica 2 confirmed to be playable co-operatively with up to four players. However, Unknown Worlds stresses the sequel &quot;is not multiplayer-focused&quot;, and that co-op is &quot;entirely optional&quot;, with players also able to play the game entirely solo if they choose.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red - which takes the long-running series to feudal Japan - will launch before the end of Ubisoft&#x27;s current financial year next March, CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed, with the publisher&#x27;s open-world Star Wars Outlaws still targeting a release in 2024.


Guillemot shared the news as part of Ubisoft&#x27;s latest earnings results - for the third quarter of fiscal 2023-24 - in which he touted a &quot;very promising line-up&quot; for the year to come. That line-up includes a 2024 release for Massive Entertainment&#x27;s highly anticipated Star Wars Outlaws, suggesting Ubisoft isn&#x27;t expecting any further slippage after it was reportedly delayed out of the publisher&#x27;s current fiscal year - ending 31st March 2024 - and into the next.


The bigger news, though, is confirmation that Ubisoft&#x27;s next blockbuster-sized Assassin&#x27;s Creed game - currently only known as Codename Red, despite confirmation of its feudal Japan setting - will be coming in fiscal year 2025, meaning a release before 31st March next year. Historically, the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise has avoided the spring launch window, suggesting Red could also be targeting 2024 - as previously reported - unless Ubisoft is breaking with tradition.

                              <span>In Nexus Mods&#x27; words: &quot;A beast of monstrous proportions is approaching.&quot; Today, the mod distribution site - home to some of the best community made video game additions (looking at you Shrek and Thomas) - will hit 10bn downloads.
To put that milestone into some perspective, &quot;if every download were a footstep, you could walk to the moon 11 times, or walk The Seven Thousand Steps to High Hrothgar 4,161,464 times,&quot; Nexus Mods said.
Meanwhile, if you are more like me and find it easier to envision things with pizza slices, if Nexus Mods celebrated each download with a slice of thick crust Margherita with extra cheese, &quot;this pizza would cover 15 times the size of Manhattan Island&quot;. These are facts you simply knead to know to appreciate how monumental this milestone really is.

The progression system has been heavily criticised by players since Forza Motorsport released in October 2023, and has been a frequent topic of discussion on the Forza Forums suggestions board.
The new changes are &quot;thanks to your feedback&quot;, Turn 10 said in its Forza Motorsport car progression update announcement.

                              <span>A re-release of the 90s point-and-click Discworld game &quot;may happen&quot;, designer Gregg Barnett has teased. However, the developer said because of the way intellectual property rights work in the UK, 50 percent of the game currently belongs to the crown, which complicates matters a tad.


Discworld was originally released in 1995, having been created with input from Discworld novels author Terry Pratchett. On its launch, the game was well-received, with many complimenting its humour. It became a classic of its time, and a source of many fond memories. I can still recall the voice of Eric Idle&#x27;s Rincewind perfectly.
A sequel then followed in the form of Discworld 2: Missing Presumed...!? in 1996, before Discworld Noir arrived in 1999.

                              <span>Artisan Studios has announced a new hand-painted RPG, with visuals and music from Final Fantasy veterans.


Lost Hellden is a new Japanese RPG that appears to be taking quite a traditional approach.


Hitoshi Sakimoto (who composed the scores for Final Fantasy 12, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Tactics Ogre among others) is providing music and audio direction, while Takeshi Oga (Gravity Rush, Siren, Final Fantasy 11 and 14) is providing illustrations.

That&#x27;s according to a fresh account with further details on the fallout from Activision&#x27;s now-legendary ousting of West and Zampella, as published on LinkedIn by lead designer Paul Sandler (spotted by PC Gamer). 


Sandler writes that he was told about the loss of West and Zampella by a fellow employee who rode a scooter around the Infinity Ward office, sharing the news. &quot;I just sat there in stunned silence with my eyes wide open,&quot; Sandler wrote. &quot;I stood up from my chair and said: &#x27;What the fuck? ...Why?&#x27;&quot;

Writing on the Deus Ex reddit, Toufexis - who also plays Sam Coe in Starfield - said he wanted to share his gratitude with the series&#x27; community. &quot;I wanted to come on here and say thank you for this page, your wonderful messages over the years, and your continued, unbelievably strong support,&quot; the actor said.
&quot;As for Jensen, we say goodbye, but hopefully not farewell. Maybe someone else will buy the licence. Maybe we&#x27;ll make an animated series or finish the game. Elon Musk is a big fan, I think he has some money. Someone ask him!&quot;

These people are part of the wider round of layoffs Microsoft is undertaking, which will see 1900 employees across Xbox and Activision Blizzard lose their jobs.
The layoffs at Toys for Bob are much higher than previously estimated - a report from two weeks ago claimed between 30 to 40 percent of jobs would be affected, which was estimated to be around 35 people.

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has said the recent spate of layoffs at Microsoft &quot;contradict&quot; what was presented in the antitrust trial over the company&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
In a letter submitted to a US Federal Appeals Court yesterday - first spotted by The Verge - the FTC argued the company&#x27;s layoff plan differs from how Microsoft represented itself in court proceedings ahead of the merger&#x27;s closure last year.
&quot;Microsoft represented to this Court that &#x27;the post-merger company will be structured and operated in a way that would readily enable Microsoft to divest any or all of the Activision businesses as robust market participants in the unlikely event that such a divestiture is ordered&#x27;,&quot; FTC counsel Imad D. Abyad wrote.

                              <span>Take-Two Interactive and 2K Games have said that virtual currencies within games are &quot;fictions created by game publishers&quot; during a lawsuit which alleges that money is effectively stolen from players when games are shut down. 


The lawsuit, originally filed in November by a Californian minor and his mother, alleges that Take-Two is guilty of civil theft and unfair business practicies for closing down servers for various NBA 2K, WWE 2K and PGA Tour 2K titles, causing players to lose access to any remaining in-game funds they have paid for.


&quot;VC [virtual currency] is not plaintiff&#x27;s property,&quot; a Take-Two lawyer stated this week, as reported by Game File. &quot;Instead, in-game VC are fictions created by game publishers, subject to the publishers’ terms of service and user agreements.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a fan of The Sims and Sims-like experiences, it’s quite an exciting time; The Sims 5, or whatever it’ll be called, is slowly fomenting over at EA, then there’s the imminent release of Paradox’s Life By You following a number of delays, and even the charmingly lo-fi Tiny Life for old-school Sims fans. Perhaps the game that’s generated the most excitement since its unveiling back in 2019 is Paralives, and after a long old wait - and five years of crowdfunding support - developer Paralives Studio has announced it&#x27;ll be entering early access next year.


That bit of information comes via Paralives new live mode gameplay video - live mode in Sims parlance is the bit where digital chracters actively go about their daily business, as opposed to the customisation-focused build mode - which focuses of the life of Anisa as she moves into a new apartment and begins to get to know the neighbourhood and her new neighbours.


There&#x27;s a look at how a Para&#x27;s personality can be created - initially by raising or lowering their physique, mind, creativity, and charisma attributes, as well as adding a &quot;vibe&quot;, social perk, talent, and through various lifestyle toggles - and after that it&#x27;s time to go outside.

                              <span>Over on Lawfare, Jim Dempsey published a really interesting proposal for software liability: “Standard for Software Liability: Focus on the Product for Liability, Focus on the Process for Safe Harbor.”
Section 1 of this paper sets the stage by briefly describing the problem to be solved. Section 2 canvasses the different fields of law (warranty, negligence, products liability, and certification) that could provide a starting point for what would have to be legislative action establishing a system of software liability. The conclusion is that all of these fields would face the same question: How buggy is too buggy? Section 3 explains why existing software development frameworks do not provide a sufficiently definitive basis for legal liability. They focus on process, while a liability regime should begin with a focus on the product—­that is, on outcomes. Expanding on the idea of building codes for building code, Section 4 shows some examples of product-focused standards from other fields. Section 5 notes that already there have been definitive expressions of software defects that can be drawn together to form the minimum legal standard of security. It specifically calls out the list of common software weaknesses tracked by the MITRE Corporation under a government contract. Section 6 considers how to define flaws above the minimum floor and how to limit that liability with a safe harbor...</span>

During a recent livestream (thanks, wccftech), industry insider Lance McDonald discussed unannounced plans to bring Dreams, released for PS4 in 2020, to both PC and PS5 - and that versions of these projects were near-complete. 


Back in 2020, Eurogamer was told by developer Media Molecule that Dreams already ran on PS5, though this version was part of the studio simply &quot;exploring&quot; the hardware. Separately, Eurogamer had heard of the game&#x27;s PC port being in development, alongside other Sony projects that have released on PC over the years.

While the exact number of those impacted by these recent layoffs remains unclear, the studio&#x27;s former art manager Brad Bowling said he and a &quot;group of very talented developers&quot; were affected. &quot;The games industry bloodletting continues,&quot; Bowling wrote on LinkedIn.
Software engineer Sydney F. is another known to be laid off from Visual Concepts Austin this month. &quot;It&#x27;s definitely rough,&quot; she wrote, stating she is one of &quot;several other amazing colleagues&quot; to have been affected by the studio cuts. &quot;I will miss all of those that I worked with greatly.&quot;

&quot;Grab your guns and brace yourself for a chaotic race to the top,&quot; the Counter-Strike 2 team implored. &quot;Work your way up to the knife stage and earn the final kill to secure the win. Go! Go! Go!&quot;


This mode also comes with two maps, known as &quot;Baggage&quot; and &quot;Shoots&quot;, for players to blast their way around. These are reworked versions of the maps that appeared in CS:GO. Baggage - which is set in an airport bagging handling facility - even has player-operated controls for the conveyer belts in the level.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair has detailed a patch that will ensure all those Pals sent to the breeding farm will no longer be so exhausted from reproducing they go to sleep and never wake up.
In addition to this life saving fix, the studio has also addressed game crashes that would corrupt save data when the number of Pals captured by the guild reached approximately 7000. It noted following its previous patch, &quot;save data that had already been in this state (for servers, the server&#x27;s world data) remained in a broken state that made it impossible to load&quot;. However, this latest Palworld patch will resolve that.
Pocketpair has also implemented a variety of countermeasures against some cheats and exploits, but it has not gone into specifics.

The lawsuit alleges McMahon sexually assaulted and sex trafficked an employee while running WWE, and claims an unnamed wrestler then requested an explicit video of the victim from McMahon during a contract renegotiation. 


The Wall Street Journal has said that wrestler is Lesnar. McMahon has denied the allegations in the lawsuit. Lesnar has not responded to requests for comment.

                              <span>If your nights spent kingly (or queenly) crusading have been growing a little stale of late, Paradox Interactive would like you to know there&#x27;s a busy year ahead for its acclaimed medieval grand strategy game, with its newly revealed 2024 Crusader Kings 3 roadmap promising two new large-scale expansions and more to freshen up that sandbox.


2024 marks the start of what Paradox is calling Crusader Kings 3: Chapter 3, which includes the aforementioned two expansions - Legends of the Dead and Roads to Power - plus the Wandering Nobles event pack, and the Couture of the Capets cosmetic clothing DLC.


Legends of the Dead is up first, falling under the banner of what Paradox likes to call a Core Expansion - which is to say, sizeable but not quite as sizeable as Crusader Kings 3&#x27;s Major Expansions. Legends of the Dead is, as its name suggests, primarily concerned with legends, giving players the means to raise their renown and strengthen the legitimacy of their rule by either commissioning an epic tale of their general awesomeness - which can then be usefully spread around the place - or by actually going out and doing some heroic deeds themselves.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Sleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training“:
Abstract: Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior: behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety...</span>

Kiryu&#x27;s comments were made during Square Enix&#x27;s latest financial results briefing, Bloomberg reported, during which he indicated a policy of reducing outsourced development and focusing on large-scale games developed in-house, with the aim of boosting both the quality of games and profit margins.


The new system is set to be announced in spring, with multiple sources at the conference call stating it will be in effect in April. That would align with the company&#x27;s new financial year.

                              <span>Valiant Hearts: Coming Home looks to be making its way to consoles in the future. 


The First World War Ubisoft sequel was previously exclusive to Netflix on mobile, having been announced during 2022&#x27;s Game Awards. However, this exclusivity may be over soon, as a post by Brazil&#x27;s ratings board (spotted by VGC) has the game listed for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. 


Valiant Hearts: Coming Home is described as a &quot;dramatic narrative game&quot; by Ubisoft, and sees players following the interweaving stories of James, Anna, Ernst and George. Walt (the first game&#x27;s canine companion) returns in the sequel to help players work their way through these stories, which include themes of friendship, survival and sacrifice &quot;amidst the turmoil and tragedy of war&quot;.

                              <span>The ability to adjust the brightness of your console&#x27;s power indicator is one of several nifty features included in the PlayStation 5&#x27;s next console update beta.


While &#x27;Bright&#x27; is the indicator&#x27;s standard level of illumination, those taking part in the beta will also be able select either &#x27;Medium&#x27; or &#x27;Dim&#x27;, if they so desire. 


New Share Screen interactions in the form of pointers and emoji reactions will also be available. Participants viewing Share Screen in fullscreen mode can send these emojis to a host as a way to provide encouragement and celebrations.

Pokémon streamer SBCoop shared the response from Twitch on X, formerly Twitter, showing the emote in question. It&#x27;s just a little Bonsly on its back crying with a hole in its base, isn&#x27;t it?


According to the removal statement from Twitch, the emote includes &quot;imagery of sexual content or nudity&quot; in a &quot;gasm-style&quot;.

                              <span>Henry Cavill has hung up the long white locks of The Witcher&#x27;s Geralt, and is now ready for his next foray into the gaming adaptation sphere with Warhammer, calling it the &quot;greatest privilege&quot; of his career.
Back in 2022, the actor signed a deal with Amazon to bring Warhammer 40,000 to our television screens. Even before this deal, Cavill was known to be famously into Warhammer 40,000, often talking about it in interviews. He once even corrected Graham Norton during an interview when the host mistakenly called Warhammer World of Warcraft.
Cavill&#x27;s long-time love for Warhammer is apparent even further thanks to a recent interview with Josh Horowitz (thanks, PC Gamer). When asked about the upcoming Warhammer 40,000 project, Cavill said it was the &quot;greatest privilege of [his] professional career&quot; to have this opportunity.

                              <span>Tencent is developing an Elden Ring mobile game, according to a new report.

The company acquired the licensing rights to Elden Ring from owner FromSoftware in 2022, Reuters reports, and a team was put together to work on a prototype. Sources say development on the project has been &quot;slow&quot;.
Tencent is reportedly seeking to turn its Elden Ring mobile version as a free-to-play title with in-app purchases, like Genshin Impact.

In an investor call today, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the company would lay out its plan for the coming financial year at its next earnings briefing, expected in May (thanks, Bloomberg).


For now, Nintendo reported a rosy set of results, with better-than-estimated numbers for Switch sales and overall profit. The current Nintendo Switch now stands at 139m sold - around 38m more than the Wii.

These are Resident Evil 3 (2020), PlateUp! and Madden NFL 24 via EA Play.
These leaks come from the ever-reliable billbil-kun of Deallabs, which has a track record of being accurate when it comes to this sort of thing. It is likely that Microsoft itself will release the full list either later today or very soon. We will update you when we know more.

Valve&#x27;s latest Steam Next Fest is already underway and runs until Monday, 12th February. That means you&#x27;ve got approximately 160 hours to piledrive your way through everything on offer - which, given the magnitude of the task, is probably a literal impossibility at this point. But then we live in a world where someone finished Dark Souls 3 with a banana, so what do I know.


As usual, Valve has tried to make the whole Sisyphean challenge a little less daunting by sorting all those playable demos into easily perusable categories on its Steam Next Fest landing page. And while you&#x27;re there, you can also take in some of the &quot;hours&quot; of developer livestreams running across the week, as if you didn&#x27;t already have enough to be getting on with.

                              <span>Following a day of reports pointing to a potentially seismic shift in Microsoft&#x27;s approach to its first-party games, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has confirmed the company will be sharing its &quot;vision for the future of Xbox&quot; in a &quot;business event&quot; next week.


All this began earlier this year, when reports surfaced that Microsoft could be preparing to release Tango Gameworks&#x27; acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush on PlayStation and Switch - a rumour that was rapidly followed by claims Rare&#x27;s multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves is also readying for release on competing consoles. However, reports began snowballing this weekend, with Starfield, Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and even Gears of War all emerging as candidates for a potential PlayStation release.


As the rumours of Xbox first-party titles going multiplatform have steadily escalated, Microsoft has remained silent, but Xbox boss Phil Spencer has now - following a dramatic day of reports from numerous reliable sources - taken to social media to announce that Xbox will be outlining its future plans in an official &quot;business update event&quot; coming next week.

                              <span>Amid a fresh swirl of reports suggesting Microsoft is at least mulling a dramatic shift in strategy for its first-party Xbox titles, it&#x27;s been claimed Gears of War - a series that&#x27;s long been tightly intertwined with Xbox&#x27;s identity - is also being considered for a PlayStation release.


That&#x27;s according to Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb, who made the claim in the latest edition of his Game Mess Mornings podcast (thanks VGC). Addressing the recent spate of rumours about first-party Xbox games heading to PlayStation - which so far include Starfield, Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, and Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming Indiana Jones game - Grubb said, &quot;The other one that I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s definitely under consideration...is Gears of War&quot;.


&quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s going to happen,&quot; he added, &quot;but it&#x27;s in talks&quot;.

                              <span>Major Xbox console exclusives such as Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield and the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are being considered for launch on Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5, as part of a huge shift in strategy by Microsoft. 


Previous reports suggested Xbox would bring a handful of smaller titles to PlayStation beginning this year, including Hi-Fi Rush - something Eurogamer understood to be true and also which has now seemingly been confirmed by its in-game files. But the idea that Microsoft will also - at some point - drop exclusivity for some of its biggest games marks a policy change far bigger than previously expected. 


A swathe of reports emerged last night suggesting Microsoft&#x27;s PlayStation plans now included Starfield - Xbox&#x27;s tentpole release for 2023, albeit one which received a somewhat mixed reception - and potentially also Indiana Jones - the company&#x27;s biggest release currently on the calendar for 2024.

                              <span>The Last of Us Part 2 was originally designed as an open-world action game that was heavily inspired by Bloodborne.
Confirmation came via co-game director Anthony Newman, who revealed during in the fantastic behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, that for the first four or five months of development, The Last of Us Part 2 was a &quot;purely melee focussed&quot; game that &quot;kept getting bigger and bigger as you explored&quot;, as inspired by FromSoft&#x27;s fan-favourite adventure.
&quot;When we started out making The Last of Us Part 2, Neil actually wanted to be very ambitious about changing the game almost entirely,&quot; explained Newman.

                              <span>Pocketpair is spending around half a million dollars a month – that&#x27;s around £378,000 – to keep its sleeper-hit Palworld&#x27;s servers online.
In a tweet, Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe posted a snippet of how the cost of servers have changed since the game launched just a few short weeks ago, joking – I hope, anyway – that the studio could &quot;go bankrupt from server fees&quot;.
Not that that kind of cost is prohibitive, apparently; Palworld network engineer Chujo Hiroto replied to their boss&#x27; message, revealing to the world that they&#x27;d been instructed to &quot;never let the service go down no matter what&quot;.

As spotted by the eagle-eyed members of the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, Dusk Golem reportedly made the announcement on Discord.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has confirmed it will re-stock the infamous Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat card in a bid to defeat scalpers that sold the free card for hundreds of pounds.
The card was initially a free add-on for Pokémon customers, given out at a rate of one card for each item in the Van Gogh collection bought, but scalpers descended onto the store in droves, wiped out the supply, and then immediately put their wares on internet auction sites at grossly inflated prices.
Shortly after, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam confirmed it will not be restocking its promotional Pokémon card following &quot;safety and security concerns&quot; for its staff and customers, and we learned just last month that four employees of the museum in Amsterdam were eventually suspended for misconduct.

                              <span>The voice actor who played Abby in The Last of Us Part 2 has revealed that not only did she receive abusive messages when the game was released, but abusers also sent death threats about her infant son, too.
Talking in the fascinating behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, Laura Bailey confirmed that the &quot;real hardcore death threats&quot; were so concerning, they were passed on to police, whilst her baby son – who was &quot;born during all of it&quot; – also received threats, too.
The threats – sent because the fictional character she played did something to another fictional character that a subset of so-called fans didn&#x27;t like – became so serious that she even had to turn some over to the police to ensure her safety.

                              <span>EA has apologised to FC 24 fans after a bugged challenge accidentally awarded thousands of players an incredibly expensive and hard-to-get TOTY player.
According to a blog posted on the official website, it seems that for 24 minutes on 30th January, players partaking in the new Squad Builder Challenges (SBC) had a spectacularly high chance of securing the 86+ OVR untradeable Lionel Messi card worth hundreds of pounds.
EA was notified of the issue and pulled the challenge within half an hour, but it was already too late; thousands of players had already snagged it, leading those  who had not been so lucky to call for EA to level the playing field – literally and metaphorically – and gift the card to all.

That&#x27;s according to one of five short documentaries Konami published on YouTube the night it shadow-dropped The Short Message.
In the fourth video, a level designer who worked on the highly-anticipated (and long rumoured) playable teaser revealed that Konami had originally reached out to the team at Hexadrive – a studio that had primarily worked on porting older games until it helped an internal Konami team develop The Short Message – &quot;about potentially porting the Silent Hill series&quot;.

                              <span>The upcoming free-to-play skateboard sim, Skate, will be available on PC via Steam.
The news was confirmed by lead creative writer Cuz Parry, who revealed that the fan-favourite skating game would be coming to PC via Steam for the very first time in a Q&amp;A video posted to YouTube just a couple of days before the holidays.
As PC Gamer points out, the news went largely unnoticed at the time, so it was only when the social media team confirmed it was &quot;stoked to announce Skate will be available on Steam for PC players&quot; earlier this week that news began to spread.

Talking at the very end of the fascinating behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, Druckmann acknowledged that whilst he didn&#x27;t yet have a story fully fleshed out, he did have a kernel of an idea that &quot;is as exciting as [The Last of Us Part 1]&quot;.
&quot;If we never get to do it again, this is a fine ending point. The last bite of the apple, the story&#x27;s done,&quot; Druckmann said.

That&#x27;s according to podcaster Moore&#x27;s Law is Dead, who stated earlier this week that Microsoft was &quot;seriously, seriously shopping around with Intel and even NVIDIA apparently for their next-gen console&quot;.
&quot;As of one month ago, no next-gen contract with AMD had been signed with Microsoft,&quot; they said.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bit of bad news if, like us, you were quietly hoping Citizen Sleeper 2 might just squeak out before the end of 2024; developer Jump Over The Age has confirmed there&#x27;s still &quot;around a year left of development&quot; on its eagerly anticipated narrative sci-fi RPG sequel. 


Jump Over The Age - AKA developer Gareth Damian Martin - announced they were working on a follow-up to the hugely well-received Citizen Sleeper back in June last year. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, as the sequel is known, introduces a brand-new Sleeper android protagonist in a new setting where players will need to build themselves a life among the stars, piloting their own ramshackle stolen ship populated by a crew they&#x27;ve recruited themselves.


An update in August gave us a first look at a new location in Citizen Sleeper 2 - a bustling way station known as Hexport - as well as confirmation it&#x27;ll be releasing for PC via both Game Pass and Steam. What we didn&#x27;t get, though, was any hint of  an ETA for Citizen Sleeper 2 - and that&#x27;s where Jump Over The Age&#x27;s lastest update comes in.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced another delay for its ambitious Sims-like Life By You, which is now due to enter Steam and Epic Games Store early access on 4th June.


Life By You, the first game from Paradox&#x27;s Tectonic studio (headed up by former Sims boss and Second Life CEO Rod Humble), was officially unveiled last March, promising a game that would let players &quot;create humans and live out their lives without loading screens&quot;.


It is, essentially, the Sims, albeit with a few key selling points intended to differentiate it from the current iteration of EA&#x27;s juggernaut franchise: it&#x27;s fully open-world with no loading screens, it features &quot;real language conversation&quot;, its digital human can optionally be controlled directly in first-person, and &quot;everything is customisable&quot;. It also sports a more realistic art style compared to the Sims 4, which, last year at least, unfortunately looked both drab and bland.

O&#x27;Hara, whose expansive career includes playing eccentric matriarch Moira Rose on Schitt&#x27;s Creek and Kate McCallister in the Home Alone films, will play an undisclosed character in HBO&#x27;s adaptation. However, previous rumours suggested she will have a recurring role as an all-new character known as Gail.
O&#x27;Hara joins Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie, Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel, Kaitlyn Dever&#x27;s Abby, Young Mazino&#x27;s Jesse, and Isabela Merced&#x27;s Dina for the second season of The Last of Us.

                              <span>As acclaimed first-person automation sim Satisfactory inches closer to the fifth anniversary of its early access launch, developer Coffee Stain Studios has revealed it&#x27;s eyeing up a version 1.0 release &quot;this year&quot;, and that the game has now sold over 5.5m copies.


Satisfactory released into early access back in March 2019 - initially as an Epic Games Store exclusive before making the jump to Steam the following year - and it quickly made a splash thanks its co-operative, open-world spin on the automated resource exploitation loop popularised by deeloper Wube Software&#x27;s much-loved Factorio.


In Satisfatory, Factorio&#x27;s irresistably compulsive fundamental formula - in which, essentially, you mine stuff to craft stuff that&#x27;ll make mining more stuff easier so you can craft bigger stuff and so on - plays in first-person across a vibrant, explorable sci-fi open-world, with up to four friends able to work together to achieve their goals. It&#x27;s a twist that&#x27;s clearly resonated with people too, as developer Coffee Stain has now revealed Satisfactory has sold over 5.5m copies since early access began.

                              <span>Jim Carrey is set to return as Dr. Robotnik in the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film.


Carrey starred as the infamous villain (Eggman, if you must) in the first two films and is now confirmed to reprise the role (thanks Variety) despite fan theories about the fate of the character.


A teaser on the Sonic the Hedgehog film account features a laugh from the villain, hinting at his return. &quot;You all thought I was gone, but I&#x27;ve just been underground,&quot; it reads. &quot;What you&#x27;ve seen from me is only a shadow of things to come...&quot;

The report was published by German PC gaming outlet GameStar and YouTube channel Game Two earlier this week, and is based on testimonies from 16 former Fntastic employees, one volunteer, and seven employees at publisher Mytona.
The claims paint a bleak image of the working environment at Fntastic, which include allegations of toxic management, in particular co-founders Eduard and Aysen Gotovtsev, and a lack of direction.

                              <span>InnerSloth and CBS Studios have shared a small teaser for their upcoming Among Us animated series.


While it doesn&#x27;t give too much away, the image shows an empty cafeteria with pizzas and balloons adorned by a banner that reads: &quot;We&#x27;re not dead&quot;. 
Well, I presume it should be read that way anyway. However, a nice big splash of red blood has covered up the middle word, leaving only &#x27;We&#x27;re&#x27; and &#x27;Dead&#x27; on show. Seems kind of sus...

                              <span>Infamous Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser believes the company used him as an example, and says his prison sentence and fine are designed to send a message to others who cross the company in the future.
To quickly recap, Bowser was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices back in 2022. The Canadian programmer had worked as part of a larger hacking group known as Team Xecuter, which in turn made millions from the sale of devices which enabled pirated video games to be played on a number of Nintendo&#x27;s consoles. At the time of his sentence, Bowser pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, as well as an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo&#x27;s own civil lawsuit against him.
Bowser was subsequently released from prison last year, however he will remain in debt to Nintendo for decades to come. In April, Bowser said Nintendo is now able to recoup 25-30 percent of his personal income for the rest of his working life.

                              <span>The boss of indie publisher Devolver Digital has stepped down with immediate effect, following yesterday&#x27;s confirmation of layoffs at the company&#x27;s Artificer studio. 


Outgoing CEO Douglas Morin departed &quot;as part of planning for Devolver&#x27;s long-term growth and development&quot;, the company said in a statement. He has been replaced by Harry Miller, a Devolver co-founder who served as CEO previously.


Devolver announced yesterday that 28 people are set to lose their jobs at the Polish-based Artificer this year, the majority of which will depart this month.

That&#x27;s now been confirmed by both the Hasbro-owned Wizards of the Coast and Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke, of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 fame.


According to a report by Pandaily, Hasbro was seeking to sell the IP with Tencent as a potential buyer and Larian Studios acting as an intermediary - 30 percent of the developer is owned by Tencent.

The numbers back up the positive reception Infinite Wealth has had from players. The game also had the series&#x27; biggest Steam launch ever, racking up over 45,000 concurrent players at peak.

PlayStation Game Size has revealed the download size of the game from the back-end of the PlayStation Store, as well as the existence of a Rebirth demo in which players will earn the in-game item Kupo Charm - Survival Set.



PlayStation will be hosting another State of Play next week dedicated solely to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth with an &quot;extensive look&quot; at the game and &quot;exciting news you won&#x27;t want to miss&quot;. Could this include an immediate demo, or at least a release date for one?

                              <span>Last week, developer Tango Gameworks distributed a relatively minor Hi-Fi Rush update to celebrate the first anniversary of the acclaimed rhythm-brawler&#x27;s release; however, dataminers poking around the update&#x27;s innards are now claiming to have found further evidence - in the form of unique t-shirt designs - that a PlayStation and Switch launch is on the way.


Reports that the previously PC and Xbox exclusive Hi-Fi Rush could be making its way to PlayStation and Switch first began circulating in January, after a number of reliable leakers started expanding on claims by insider Nate the Hate that Microsoft was set to &quot;one of [its] more acclaimed first party releases to a competitor system&quot; this year.


And while there&#x27;s been no sign of an official announcement to back up those reports in the weeks since, datamined discoveries in Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s latest update (thanks Wario64) have lent further credence to the rumours. Patch 7, as last week&#x27;s update is officially known, includes an Anniversary T-Shirt Bundle containing new clothing for Chai to wear. Four of these designs are available to everyone, while three are exclusive to the platform - Xbox, Steam, or the Epic Games Store - players own the game on. However, a number of dataminers are now claiming to have unearthed two additional, unused T-shirts in the update, looking suspiciously like exclusive designs for Switch and PlayStation.

The Forever Labyrinth, which has been made in partnership with the Google Arts &amp; Culture initiative, transports players to an ever-shifting maze of rooms - resembling everything from serene gardens to clifftops, forests, and cellars - as they search for their friend Professor Sheldrake, who&#x27;s lost amid its mysterious interlinking passageways.


These passageways take the form of paintings and art - &quot;drawn from the collections of great museums who are keen to share their treasures in new and exciting ways online&quot;, as the press release puts it - scattered around each room. By collecting clues and identifying elements present within the artwork, players can learn to navigate the labyrinth and hopefully find their friend - if the monster ceaselessly devouring the world doesn&#x27;t get them first.

                              <span>Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Abubakar Salim - who voiced Bayek in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins and starred in HBO&#x27;s Raised by Wolves - now has a demo on Steam ahead of its PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch release this April.


Tales of Kenzera, a Metroidvania-style side-scrolling action-adventure, was unveiled by Salim during an emotional appearance at last year&#x27;s The Game Awards in which he paid tribute to his late father. &quot;For a long time,&quot; he explained, &quot;I&#x27;ve struggled to find a way of communicating my journey with grief. To now be able to do that through Zau&#x27;s story of loss, growth and healing in Tales of Kenzera: Zau feels so right.&quot;


Taking inspiration from African Bantu tales, the game - which is being developed by Salim&#x27;s Surgent Studios and published by EA via its Originals label - follows the journey of Zau, a young shaman who bargains with the God of death to bring his Baba back from darkness.

                              <span>Following a cautious, gradual roll-out to stop everything blowing up in a tangle of lost progress and Tenno tears, developer Digital Extremes has announced that free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe&#x27;s long-awaited cross-platform save feature is now available to all players.


Digital Extremes has been slowly working away on Warframe&#x27;s cross-platform support for a number of years now; cross-play was first introduced back in December 2022, while cross-save - enabling players to pick up where they left off regardless of the platform they&#x27;re playing on - starting rolling out in December last year.


At the time, Digital Extremes explained it would be taking a cautious approach and introducing cross-save in phases, to avoid risking timeouts caused by high demand - something that could potentially be catastrophic for a feature as sensitive as account merging. Since then, it&#x27;s been rolling out cross-save support to players in batches, but today brings the news it&#x27;ll now be immediately available to anyone that wants to take advantage of the feature.

In short, her exclusivity deal with the Amazon-owned streaming platform came to an end and Pokimane decided not to renew the contract. &quot;The end of an era,&quot; she posted on X, formerly Twitter. &quot;Twitch has been my home for a decade...but it&#x27;s time to say thank you for all the memories and love during my League, Fortnite, and Among Us days.&quot;


It means Twitch - a platform derided for its lack of diversity - has just lost one of its most popular and high profile female streamers and, on her podcast series Don&#x27;t Tell Anyone, she detailed her concerns about the platform.

The demo lets you play through four levels from the first world - three in which Mario collects the toys, and one where you get to lead the Mini-Marios to a toy box.
Nintendo has also released a new overview trailer for the game to coincide with the demo.

                              <span>If you have been wanting to play Alan Wake 2, but were put off by the game&#x27;s semi-regular, flashing jump scares, I have good news. 


As part of its recent update, Remedy has added a feature that will allow you to tone down those horror flashes (apparently a much-requested addition). Players can now opt for either a Low or Normal visual and audio intensity of horror flash, to curate the game better to their liking. 


Along with this option to dial back on the scaries, the studio has also introduced a Chapter Select function. This will allow players to load up any mission they fancy as long as they have previously unlocked it. Yes, this means you can go back and replay Alan Wake 2&#x27;s awesome musical moments again and again and again.

&quot;Over the past year, both companies have worked together to navigate the studio&#x27;s difficulties to ensure Artificer remains open and that their hard work is realised with the launch of their next game. Layoffs are not easy, and the remaining team at Artificer and Devolver Digital are committed to supporting these talented and creative professionals find new roles throughout the industry.&quot;

As previously reported, the game will have both a free and paid season pass (£4.99), with the premium version offering early access to new content and additional cosmetic rewards. We now know Square Enix has updates planned for the next year, with seasons updating each month.

Given the mysterious nature of the Blue Hole, where Dave the Diver is set, it&#x27;s not surprising that it&#x27;s prone to visits from the famous sea monster.
Developer Mintrocket hasn&#x27;t said much on how Godzilla will fit into the game, other than telling players to &quot;prepare to meet the King of the Monsters in the Blue Hole&quot;. Godzilla makes his appearance at the end of the announcement trailer for Dave the Diver&#x27;s PlayStation release.

                              <span>At last night&#x27;s State of Play, Vertigo Games and Deep Silver lifted the lid on Metro Awakening, an upcoming origin story for the Metro series.


The game is described as a story-driven adventure, built exclusively for VR. It promises plenty of stealth and a good dash of combat, with the developer stating this will be the &quot;most immersive&quot; Metro experience to date. 


You will play as Serdar in Metro Awakening. Serdar is &quot;a doctor and a rationalist&quot; in search of medication for his wife. This search will take players to the tunnels beneath Moscow, but it won&#x27;t be an easy trip. You see, the tunnels are full of mutants.  &quot;As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become...&quot; the official blurb teases. You can see Metro Awakening&#x27;s announcement trailer below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good long while since we&#x27;ve seen anything concrete from Konami and developer Bloober Team&#x27;s Silent Hill 2 remake, but the project has now received a fresh airing as part of Sony&#x27;s latest PlayStation State of Play showcase, this time with a trailer focusing on the game&#x27;s &quot;improved and modernised&quot; combat.


Combat perhaps isn&#x27;t the first thing you&#x27;d expect Konami&#x27;s marketing material to dwell on given it&#x27;s quite some way down the list of elements that made the original Silent Hill 2 such a beloved horror experience, but the trailer does, in fairness, hang back a whole 40 seconds before switching out the atmospheric meandering for bat-swinging, shotgun-blasting action.


Additionally, it&#x27;s reassuring, and perhaps even a little surprising, to see just how closely Bloober Team&#x27;s Silent Hill 2 remake hews to aesthetic of the original 2001 PlayStation 2 game - it certainly doesn&#x27;t look like we&#x27;re in for a radical tonal reinvention here.

What are you hoping to see? Could Square Enix drop a demo like they did with Final Fantasy 16?

                              <span>During this evening&#x27;s State of Play, we were all treated to a brand new and rather surreal look at Death Stranding 2, officially now known as On the Beach (as suspected). 


The sequel was first announced to be in development back in 2022 during the Game Awards, with a  bamboozling trailer featuring Léa Seydoux and Norman Reedus.


Tonight&#x27;s trailer has now given us another slice of Kojima-infused pie, and once again it is as perplexing as you would expect. It includes a rather epic looking battle that I won&#x27;t spoil by trying to describe it here. We also got a brief look at Elle Fanning&#x27;s Death Stranding 2 character. The actress was first confirmed to be part of the sequel a while ago, after a series of enigmatic teases from Kojima (although, we all guessed).

                              <span>PlayStation has announced Physint, a major new project with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima, to &quot;reinvent&quot; the genre he is most famous for. 


This new &quot;next-generation action espionage game&quot; will be a fresh, original IP - as Metal Gear Solid remains owned by Konami - and will also be a movie as well.


&quot;Preparations are udnerway, but production will begin in earnest at Kojima Productions after Death Stranding 2,&quot; Kojima said tonight during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play - during which we also learned Death Stranding 2 is set to arrive in 2025.

                              <span>Supermassive Games&#x27; hugely entertaining PS4 slasher horror Until Dawn is - as was widely reported prior today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play showcase - getting a PlayStation 5 and PC remaster, and it&#x27;ll be launching later this year.


The original Until Dawn released for PlayStation 4 back in 2015, offering up an atmospheric, knowingly cheesy spin on the teen slasher genre whose branching narrative could be nudged in different directions depending on the choices players made - with their actions determining who lived and who died, even what sort of threat they might be facing. 


Supermassive later returned to the well with its similarly styled Dark Pictures Anthology series, but Until Dawn is still regarded as highpoint for the studio, so it&#x27;s nice to see it get a bit of a refresh - or &quot;rebuilt and enhanced&quot; as Sony is putting it - for a new generation of players.

                              <span>Tonight brought a fresh look at Judas, the first new game from BioShock creator Ken Levine in over a decade, and the first ever to come from his studio Ghost Story Games.


A new trailer shown during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play suggested Judas was set in a futuristic world where everyone&#x27;s thoughts are recorded - and shown off on a series of screens. 


All these thoughts are &quot;planted in your brain like weeds in a garden&quot;, a character who looks slightly similar to BioShock Infinite&#x27;s Elizabeth suggests, revealing that she&#x27;s going to help free people from this.

The Short Message - which first surfaced in September 2022 via a South Korea ratings board listing - made its formal debut during tonight&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play showcase, with its announcement trailer revealing a first-person experience focusing on a young woman and featuring heavy interactions with her mobile phone.


&quot;Silent Hill: The Short Message is a new, short-form Silent Hill title, featuring a young, contemporary protagonist,&quot; Konami explains over on the PlayStation Blog. &quot;In 2022, we announced a revival for the Silent Hill series, along with several new titles in development, and this marks the first of that new wave of games to be released.&quot;

Generations featured 2D and 3D levels in a nod to both modern and classic Sonic. Now we&#x27;ll get Shadow levels on top with this new release in autumn this year.

                              <span>With February almost upon us, Sony has revealed the next batch of monthly games it&#x27;s making available to subscribers of its PlayStation Plus Essential tier - and it&#x27;s also announced a two-hour trial of developer Insomniac&#x27;s acclaimed Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 for Premium subscribers.


Starting with the games, February&#x27;s first Essential offering is Foamstars, Square Enix&#x27;s stylish, Splatoon-esque 4v4 live-service game in which players furiously hose each other into submission with a torrent of slippery soapsuds. It&#x27;ll be available on both PlayStation 4 and PS5.


Next up is Rollerdrome, from OlliOlli developer Roll7. Set a world ruled by corporations, where the public is kept placated by a brutal blood sport known as Rollerdrome, it sees players donning rollerskates for some high-speed third-person shooting action, where performing tricks restores ammo and bullet-time-style slo-mo can be deployed against opponents.

                              <span>Palworld - you know, the open-world survival game with the definitely-not-Pokémon you might have heard about once or twice lately - has, less than two weeks after its early access release, officially surpassed 19m players on Xbox Series X/S and PC, with Microsoft now touting it as the biggest third-party launch in Game Pass&#x27; history.


We&#x27;ve known known developer Pocketpair has had a hit on its hands with Palworld for some time now, of course; its early access launch on 19th January got off a bumpy start as an initial influx of players brought the game&#x27;s servers to their knees, and just 24 hours later Pocketpair revealed 2m players were already galavanting around the Palapagos Islands.


Shortly after, Palworld became one of only six games ever to hit 1m concurrent players on Steam, and then updated sales figures brought the news it had shifted over 5m copies in just three days. Six days after launch, Steam sales hit 8m, and now, 12 days in, Pocketpair has announced Palworld has surpassed 19m players.

                              <span>After months of conceptual chatter over on its blog, developer The Chinese Room has finally whipped back the shroud on its version of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, giving a first proper look at its in-game action courtesy of an 15-minute gameplay reveal.


Prior to today, The Chinese Room - which took over the troubled Bloodlines 2 back in 2021, although the studio&#x27;s involvement wasn&#x27;t announced until last year - has talked a little about the game&#x27;s main character, vampire elder Phyre, its clans, and its &quot;visceral immersive combat&quot;, and all of that comes together in today&#x27;s extended gameplay debut.


According to The Chinese Room, this 15-minute first-look features a sequence from relatively early in the game, taking place after Phyre - who in this particular playthrough is part of the Brujah clan, imbuing her with supernatural speed and strength, as well as a rather short fuse - has established herself in Seattle and made inroads with the court. As she investigates the mysterious mark on her hand limiting her powers, she receives a tip-off leading her to a warehouse and a vampire known as Willem who might just have some answers.

Using a panel of 709 volunteers who shared archives of their Facebook data, Consumer Reports found that a total of 186,892 companies sent data about them to the social network. On average, each participant in the study had their data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied significantly, with some panelists’ data listing over 7,000 companies providing their data. The Markup helped Consumer Reports recruit participants for the study. Participants downloaded an archive of the previous three years of their data from their Facebook settings, then provided it to Consumer Reports...</span>

                              <span>Two weeks after Microsoft&#x27;s turn, it&#x27;s now Sony&#x27;s time in the spotlight. Tonight&#x27;s big PlayStation State of Play broadcast is the first we&#x27;ve heard from Sony this year - and this evening looks set to lay out a line-up of blockbusters coming to PS5 over 2024 - and into 2025.
Join us as we watch and cover everything live from 10pm UK time (GMT) - the show is set to last 40 minutes, and feature 15 games. 
What do we expect? Quite a lot, actually. Sony itself has said to expect &quot;guest appearances from some of the most talented minds in gaming&quot; - and without an invitation ourselves we can only assume this means Hideo Kojima. It&#x27;s high time we heard more about Death Stranding 2. But who else might also qualify? Our money&#x27;s on BioShock creator Ken Levine, whose long-awaited Judas is now finally nearing release.

However, you will also unlock an exclusive dynamic background of the same theme so you can match your console&#x27;s Home screen to your hardware.

According to its website, the studio is currently hiring for a AAA arcade racing title built in Unreal 5 for Gen 5 consoles and PC, which is set to disrupt the racing scene.

This makes it the fastest selling Resident Evil title &quot;by far&quot; - a stat tracked by Alex Aniel, writer of Itchy Tasty: An Unofficial History of Resident Evil - although the game still sits behind the likes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Village in terms of total sales to date.


In its recent consolidated financial results, Capcom said these more recent Resident Evil 4 sales have been supported by &quot;ongoing promotional measures&quot; such as free updates for the PlayStation VR2 version.

                              <span>The boss of Apex Legends and Battlefield maker EA has been asked about Nintendo Switch 2, ahead of the unannounced console&#x27;s widely-expected launch later this year.


Quizzed on how Switch 2&#x27;s arrival will impact EA, the company&#x27;s CEO Andrew Wilson said he could &quot;absolutely not comment on anything that has not been announced or acknowledge it in any way&quot;, before going on to say the company was pumped for &quot;new platforms&quot; in general.


&quot;What I would say,&quot; Wilson told investors, &quot;to the extent that platforms over the course of the last 20 years have come out and offered improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution... where we&#x27;re able to deliver more immersion for our players, particularly around our biggest franchises like FC, like Madden, like Battlefield, like Apex that has typically been very good for our business.

                              <span>Sega of America will layoff 61 staff next month.


The news has spread following the issue of a Californian WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) notice - required by law to give employees 60 days in advance of sizable layoffs.


Eurogamer can confirm, via the Employment Development Department of the State of California, that two separate layoffs of 12 and 49 staff will take place on 8th March.

                              <span>A group of former Volition developers have joined the development of steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution under the banner of a fresh studio.
Shapeshifter Games has been founded by Volition veterans, following the studio&#x27;s closure last year and poor reception to its Saints Row reboot. Now, LinkedIn profiles of employees have since confirmed Shapeshifter&#x27;s first project (thanks TechRaptor). 
On LinkedIn, Shapeshifter Games stated it is a co-development studio and revealed it was already working &quot;with a top publisher on their next great IP&quot;. Shortly after, inXile Entertainment released a statement announcing its partnership with Shapeshifter to help work on Clockwork Revolution.

One of the main draws of spending £100 on the game&#x27;s deluxe edition was its ability to play from Monday this week, before the game&#x27;s general release on Friday. 


But developer Rocksteady has twice had to take Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#x27;s servers offline to fix problems with the game - leaving the always-online co-op title completely unplayable in the interim.

                              <span>A mobile version of Palworld has appeared on the Apple App Store, said to be coming soon - but it is not the real deal. 


The app, which you can see below in screenshots taken by Eurogamer, appears at first glance to be affiliated with Palworld developer Pocketpair and uses the same promotional images as on PC and Xbox. But this app has nothing to do with Pocketpair, and has instead been published by someone known as Oleksandra Kryccun.


Pocketpair has now said it is aware of this app&#x27;s existence, and warned players not to be fooled by its arrival on the App Store (we&#x27;ve checked, and can&#x27;t see it on the Google Play store at present).

In a new update, assistance features have been added across all six games that allow players to modify the amount of EXP, gil or magic AP they receive, or turn off enemy encounters entirely.


Further, players can switch between the original or newly arranged soundtracks, plus the font type can be switched between modern and classic versions.

                              <span>Microsoft has shared its Q2 2024 financial results, reporting significant revenue gains across its gaming division - including a massive 61 percent increase in Xbox content and services revenue - following its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


As per its Q2 earnings release, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming revenue increased by 49 percent compared to the equivalent quarter in its previous financial year, with the company recording a 61 percent boost in Xbox content and services revenue - which encompasses money generated by the likes of  Game Pass - alongside a three percent increase in Xbox hardware revenue.


Unsurprisingly, Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard acquisition was a key driver of its Q2 growth, with the deal contributing to just over $2bn in revenue. However, operating expenses and other costs - including transaction- and integration-related costs - saw the net impact of the Activision Blizzard deal result in an operating loss of $440m.

                              <span>Following a little under two weeks of Steam beta testing, Starfield&#x27;s latest patch is now available for all players on PC and Xbox Series X/S, bringing quest fixes, visual improvements, and more.


As noted in Bethesda&#x27;s announcement post, Starfield&#x27;s latest update - officially numbered 1.9.51.0 - has received one additional PC crash fix in the jump from beta to full release. That tweak joins &quot;over a hundred fixes and adjustments&quot; detailed in its previous beta patch notes.


For the most part, updated 1.9.51.0 is focused on quality-of-life improvements and quest fixes, with Bethesda saying its quashed instances of bulldozed objects reappearing when returning to an outpost, ship hatches being marked as inaccessible, and more. There&#x27;s also yet another fix intended to stamp out the lingering issue of asteroids doggedly following ships across the galaxy like overly enthusiastic puppies.

                              <span>If your interests exist squarely within the Venn diagram of Mass Effect and Destiny 2, your day is almost here: Bungie has announced it&#x27;s teaming up with EA and BioWare to bring Commander Shepard and company - or at least something vaguely inspired by them - to its free-to-play shooter as part of a new collaboration event.


As per Bungie&#x27;s announcement, the &#x27;Destiny 2 x BioWare&#x27; team-up will enable Destiny 2 players to &quot;join the crew of the Normandy&quot; from 13th February - which all sounds very exciting until it finishes its sentence, &quot;with new cosmetics and in-game items&quot;.


On the premium cosmetics front, a new Normandy Crew Bundle will be available in the Eververse store once the event begins, containing a Commander Shepard-inspired N7 armour set for Titans, a Garrus-inspired Vakarian set for Hunters, and a Liara-inspired Shadow Broker set for Warlocks. An Omni Strike finisher and Flux Dance will also be purchasable with Silver.

                              <span>Hinterland, the developer behind snowy survival game The Long Dark, has teased an &#x27;unannounced survival game&#x27; currently in development at the studio, and the accompanying alpha footage certainly has the hallmarks of a potential The Long Dark 2.


Hinterland boss Raphael van Lierop (who confirmed he was stepping away from The Long Dark to start a new project at the studio back in 2022) shared the 22 seconds of &quot;in-engine pre-alpha&quot; footage on social media today, along with the caption, &quot;Some good things happening in the Unannounced Survival Games space...&quot;.


The video itself is little more than a slow pan across a slightly ramshackle room - but a closer look might just offer some big clues as to the nature of Hinterland&#x27;s new project. A running tally of &quot;days&quot; scrawled on the mirror and the general makeshift dilapidation of the room certainly suggest some kind of disaster has befallen the world outside, while the two roaring fires and the howling wind absolutely bring The Long Dark&#x27;s big freeze to mind.

                              <span>We all knew Nintendo would come after the Palworld Pokémon mod, but its modder has quickly struck back with a new download which replaces Palworld&#x27;s friendly Pals with totally original &quot;legally distinct&quot; and &quot;legit copyright free&quot; pocket creatures.
Last week, YouTuber ToastedShoes took the Palworld&#x27;s close Pokémon comparisons to the extreme, with an unlicensed Pokémon mod. Footage of the mod remained on the internet for about a day, before Nintendo got to work scrubbing it away. 
The Pokémon Company itself soon responded, stating its intent to &quot;investigate and take appropriate measures&quot; regarding anything that could infringe on its copyright. Meanwhile, modding hub Nexus Mods released its own statement confirming it won&#x27;t host Pokémon-themed Palworld mods thanks to the &quot;headache of DMCA/legal threats from Nintendo&quot;.

As a reminder, Suicide Squad is technically out on 2nd February, but early access was included in its Deluxe Edition, which costs £100 / $100.
At 11:22am this morning, developer Rocksteady announced a scheduled maintenance for Suicide Squad beginning at 11:30am. &quot;The game will be offline until maintenance has been completed,&quot; the developer stated, with no estimate of when it&#x27;ll be back online.

                              <span>Nightingale, the upcoming gaslamp fantasy game from Inflexion Games, will get a server stress test this Friday, 2nd February. It&#x27;s a one-day only affair - if that - running from 6pm to 9pm UK time (1pm to 4pm Eastern). 


Randomly selected players who had previously signed up for the test will start receiving access to the game one hour before. Others will then be invited to play in batches. Again, this will be random, so keep an eye out for an email from Steam.


&quot;Our goal is for all players who signed up for the test to be able to participate. How quickly that happens will be dependent on how the test progresses,&quot; Inflexion said, explaining it will granting access in waves to assess how servers handle large amounts of players logging in at the same time and the developer&#x27;s ability to rapidly scale up in response.

                              <span>Following the departure of Mike Ybarra, Blizzard has announced its new president: Activision&#x27;s former general manager of its Call of Duty franchise, Johanna Faries.


Faries&#x27; new position was announced last night, following layoffs at Microsoft last week. Her appointment marks the first new leader of the studio since Microsoft finally purchased Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in October, following almost two years of regulatory approvals and legal wrangling. Her official first day will be next month, on 5th February.


In an email sent to Blizzard staff, Faries acknowledged that her new role at Blizzard may stir up a &quot;range of reactions, questions and even concerns&quot;. The new president noted Activision, Blizzard and indeed King are all &quot;decidedly different companies with distinct games, cultures and communities&quot;, despite being under one umbrella.

&quot;We want it to be &#x27;always on&#x27;,&quot; Warner Bros gaming and streaming boss JB Perrette told Variety. &quot;And the good news is the gaming space is lending itself to that.&quot;

Speaking in the same interview, Warner Bros Interactive boss David Haddad said that video games will be a key component in ensuring those franchises remain evergreen - and ever lucrative.

                              <span>Some games can take forever to finish. Hours upon hours can be put into any given title, as players make their steady way to victory. When those credits ultimately roll, the sense of achievement can be a wonderful feeling. 


But, this isn&#x27;t the case with Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, at least right now. In fact, many are finding they have &#x27;completed the game&#x27; even before they take their first step. This is thanks to an issue that has seen those already with their hands on the game logging in to find they have full story completion from the off. 


Developer Rocksteady is aware of this unexpected narrative fast track, and is now in the process of sorting it all out.

                              <span>Fighting and fantasy fans are desperate to see Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s Tifa in Tekken 8, so much so Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada acknowledged it.


Plenty of fans have noted how well suited Tifa would be to the fighting game series, but Harada&#x27;s X (formerly Twitter) post about Rebirth and Tekken 8 booths being next to each other at the Taipei Game Show spurred on fan desires.


&quot;All I&#x27;m gonna say... is what everyone else here is saying... but I&#x27;m gonna say it anyways... because &#x27;Tifa Lockhart&#x27; would be absolutely INCREDIBLE if she made it into &#x27;Tekken 8&#x27; this time Harada-San!!!,&quot; replied one fan.

                              <span>Edmund McMillen has discussed a potential Fortnite collaboration with Epic Games, the celebrated indie designer has said. 


The maker of Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac, The End is Nigh and The Legend of Bum-bo confirmed in a post on X that he had chatted with the maker of Fortnite about a possible team-up in future. 


It&#x27;s unclear from McMillen&#x27;s response how far talks have got, though it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time Fortnite has collaborated with an indie developer on some form of crossover.

                              <span>Footage from a cancelled futuristic Call of Duty sci-fi game in development by Tony Hawk&#x27;s studio Neversoft has leaked online. 


The footage was spotted by Call of Duty insider account CharlieIntel, and seemingly comes from a cancelled Xbox 360-era Call of Duty game known as Future Warfare (or &quot;NX1&quot; internally). The game was originally in development at Neversoft, which was ultimately merged into Infinity Ward in 2014.


Confirming the footage as legitimate, former Neversoft developer Brian Bright said this cancelled Call of Duty release would have launched in place of Ghosts. &quot;Neversoft pivoted from Guitar Hero to make a futuristic COD game,&quot; Bright wrote on X. &quot;I believe this would have been in place of Ghosts, trying to remember. We had two to three campaign missions, and a bunch of [multiplayer] work done (I was lead MP on this) before cancellation.&quot;

                              <span>Sony will step up to the spotlight this week with a PlayStation State of Play broadcast, it&#x27;s been reported. 


PlayStation is yet to confirm the broadcast itself, but a number of insiders have suggested we&#x27;ll see the next State of Play in the coming days - and Eurogamer has heard similar. 


XboxEra&#x27;s Nick and YouTuber Rand al Thor have both suggested Sony&#x27;s broadcast is planned for &quot;around&quot; this Wednesday, 31st January, pending any last minute changes. The pair also teased many of the games Sony will include in the showcase, such as Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Death Stranding 2.

                              <span>Nexon has announced it is pulling the plug on its free-to-play PvP medieval fantasy game Warhaven just four months after it launched in early access.
Despite initial plans to launch the game in full later this year, Nexon has now revealed that rather than launching the game in early 2024, it&#x27;s shutting down on 5th April, 2024.
&quot;Today, we are here to announce with a heavy heart that we will be concluding the live services of Warhaven,&quot; the team announced on Steam earlier this week.

                              <span>Free &quot;interactive study&quot; Interaction Isn&#x27;t Explicit is now available via the PlayStation Store.
Described as a &quot;short, interactive study&quot; by designer Frank L. Silva, Interaction Isn&#x27;t Explicit &quot;isn&#x27;t a traditional game but a debate of different aspects of game design&quot; that aims to explore the &quot;pros and cons&quot; of traditional mechanics and consider which ones are &quot;essential for the language of computer games&quot;.
You can see the announcement trailer below, which shows how the interactive piece reflects on the ways we play games, and the visual languages we use to understand them:

In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the team confirmed that even though the monster-collecting game has barely been out a week, it has already received reports from players that they have encountered &quot;cheating on official servers&quot;.
In a statement entitled &quot;Regarding countermeasures against cheating on official servers&quot;, the team said: &quot;Currently, some players have been confirmed to be cheating on the official server.

                              <span>Ironmace says a court has dismissed its former publisher Nexon&#x27;s request for an injunction following the publisher&#x27;s claim that Dark and Darker has been written with stolen code from a game the team had been developing for Nexon.
In a statement to players on its Discord server, an Ironmace developer – known as SDF – reported that a court has dismissed Nexon&#x27;s injunction for &quot;trade secret and copyright infringement&quot;, &quot;thus rejecting the claims and suspicions that Dark &amp; Darker was developed by using Nexon’s trade secrets and infringing on its copyrights&quot;.
The court also reportedly ruled that Dark and Darker&#x27;s service &quot;should not be suspended based on Nexon&#x27;s claims and evidence alone&quot;, paving a potential return to Steam for the game.

Beginning in late November 2023, the threat actor used a password spray attack to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account and gain a foothold, and then used the account’s permissions to access a very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts, including members of our senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity, legal, and other functions, and exfiltrated some emails and attached documents. The investigation indicates they were initially targeting email accounts for information related to Midnight Blizzard itself. ...</span>

In a statement posted to X/Twitter over the weekend, Bleszinski – who last contributed to a Gears game back in 2011 – said that as the Gears of War franchise has long been &quot;an ENORMOUS part of [his] legacy&quot;, he was open to work with Microsoft as &quot;just from a PR standpoint alone, it would be gold&quot;.
However, it seems that neither Microsoft nor Coalition has taken Bleszinski up on his offer, and thus he has &quot;moved on&quot; from game development.

The official Palworld X/Twitter account acknowledged that, further to the patch that deployed earlier in the week, some players may be experiencing &quot;congested access&quot;.
&quot;Following the recent patch, numerous logins are concurrently underway, leading to congested access,&quot; the team explained in the statement.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair has dropped a new Steam demo for its upcoming Metroidvania, Never Grave: The Witch and The Curse.
The upcoming game – which, like Pocketpair&#x27;s predecessor, is fielding accusations of alleged plagiarism given its striking similarity to another fan-favourite Metroidvania game – doesn&#x27;t yet have a release date, but is expected to release in the next three months, offering up to four-player multiplayer.
Unlike Palworld, however, Pocketpair isn&#x27;t listed as this game&#x27;s developer, only its publisher. Pocketpair was listed as the developer up until three days ago, but after a quick check with SteamDB, it seems this was changed on 25 January 2024.

                              <span>Sony has quietly blocked the Cronus Zen from connecting to PS5 consoles via its latest firmware update, a device which lets players use, or modify, &quot;any supported controller&quot; on Sony&#x27;s console.
Whilst Sony rolled out the change without explicitly acknowledging the change, Cronus Zen users soon noticed their devices were being disconnected following the PS5 update earlier this week, prompting Cronus to issue a statement to players affected by the change.
The developer behind Cronus Zen describes the device as one that allows players to connect &quot;any supported controller, mouse, keyboard or racing wheel, to any major gaming console platform&quot;, offering an advanced scripting engine &quot;that allows you to run powerful macros&quot;.

In a post shared to Twitter/X, Bleszinski said he took the idea of &quot;medieval Pokémon with baby dragons instead&quot; to Epic, but the idea was &quot;rejected at all the major publishers&quot;.
When asked by a curious follower what Epic said when Bleszinski made the pitch, he simply said: &quot;It just… never went anywhere. I wanted to do it on mobile first&quot;.

                              <span>Crash Bandicoot developer Toys for Bob and Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer Games have reportedly lost around 40 per cent and 30 per cent of their staff, respectively.
The layoffs are part of Microsoft&#x27;s decision to lay off 1900 employees across its video game teams. In an email sent to employees, Xbox boss Phil Spencer called this a &quot;painful decision after Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year, and $7.5bn acquisition of Zenimax in 2021. Microsoft also laid off almost 900 positions this time last year, too.

The kart racer based on Bloodborne was initially expected to release at the end of the month, but the indie team now says it needs additional time to &quot;scrub the branding off of&quot; the game.
&quot;Long story short, we need to scrub the branding off of what was previously known as Bloodborne Kart,&quot; the team said yesterday. &quot;We will do this, but that requires a short delay.&quot;

                              <span>Sker Ritual – the round-based co-op survival FPS and spin-off to horror, Maid of Sker – has launched a new demo for prospective PS5 players to try before they buy.
The early access co-op horror – which has a &quot;mostly positive&quot; user score aggregated from 650+ Steam players and is currently ranked 3.6 out of 5 on the PS store – already offers demos for PC and Xbox Series X players.
The demo offers players the chance to experience the &quot;fan-favourite&quot; map Cursed Lands of Lavernock, although while the game offers &quot;round-based FPS&quot; for up to four players, the demo is a purely single-player experience, I&#x27;m afraid. Full co-op will be available when the horror shooter launches in April 2024.

                              <span>Stardew Valley creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone has shared an update on the farm-life sim&#x27;s highly anticipated - and long-in-the-works - 1.6 update, saying he&#x27;s now &quot;done adding major new content&quot; and that it&#x27;ll &quot;definitely&quot; be out this year.


Barone revealed he was working on a 1.6 update for Stardew Valley back in June 2022, warning it would be relatively modest in scope and &#x27;mostly modding-focused&#x27;.


With each new showing, however, 1.6 has seemingly grown more ambitious; by September last year, Barone confirmed it would include one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and crafting recipes, new dialogue lines, a new farm type, new late-game content, winter outfits for villagers, a new larger chest, 8-player co-op on PC, and more - that &quot;and more&quot; encompassing perhaps 1.6&#x27;s most important addition: hats for cats and dogs.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been five months since Paradox Interactive&#x27;s surprise announcement Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture developer The Chinese Room had taken the reins of its troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2; in that time, the studio has been openly discussing its approach to the sequel, with its latest update now focusing on what it&#x27;s calling &quot;visceral immersive combat&quot;.


In a newly shared blog post, creative director Alex Skidmore outlines three main gameplay styles the studio wants accommodate on release, each emphasising or de-emphasising combat in different ways. The first is what it calls the Strategic Stalker, a take on the &quot;vampire predator fantasy&quot; where the focus is on staying hidden and using the element of surprise.


This stealth-focused approach to combat, says Skidmore, is all about sneaking up on an enemy, causing a distraction, then feeding on them quickly before a fight can occur. That&#x27;s in stark contrast to combat style number two - the Action Brawler - which is for players that want to get stuck straight into a fight using &quot;fast reflexes and combat skills&quot;.

                              <span>As The Last of Us Part 2 strides back in the spotlight thanks to its recently released PlayStation 5 remaster, developer Naughty Dog has announced an arrival date for its previously revealed making-of documentary, which will be available to watch on YouTube and in-game via an impending Remastered patch from Friday, 2nd February.


Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2 is (as its name very much implies) the sequel to Naughty Dog&#x27;s original Grounded documentary, which released in 2015 and charted the &quot;dogged development and unique philosophy&quot; of the first The Last of Us game.


This follow-up documentary almost didn&#x27;t happen; filming was forced to wrap up prematurely when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020, but the footage (which goes back to The Last of Us Part 2&#x27;s early days in 2016) has now been revisited and assembled into an 85-minutes behind-the-scenes feature exploring the sequel&#x27;s development.

                              <span>A cunning Palworld fan has found an unreleased Pal creature hiding away in the game&#x27;s code. 


The black and purple beastie is currently codenamed &quot;Dark Mutant&quot;, and can be seen through a datamine of Palworld&#x27;s files. It has a 3D model - which you can see above - and a text log entry for the game&#x27;s Pokédex, sorry, Paldex.


&quot;Some say a beam from a {characterName id&#x3D;|DarkMutant|/}  that has perfected its technique can tear holes into other dimensions,&quot; the game says of the creature. &quot;It&#x27;s even believed that certain species of Pals were born from such phenomena.&quot;

                              <span>Reikon Games has reportedly laid off 60 to 70 people, equating to 56 percent of the company. 


According to Kotaku, layoffs at the Ruiner developer happened on 23rd January. These layoffs were to the surprise of its staff, who said they were &quot;sudden&quot; and &quot;shocking&quot;. 


The Poland-based company was established in 2014. It went on to release Ruiner, a brutal action shooter, in 2017. In Eurogamer&#x27;s Ruiner review, contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called it a &quot;powerfully grim, fleet-footed cyberpunk action odyssey that is caught in the spell of its own nihilism&quot;.

                              <span>Ubisoft has announced an open beta for Skull and Bones. 


The studio&#x27;s long-in-the-works pirate game has had quite a troubled development, which has resulted in several delays over the last few years. However, it now seems like Skull and Bones is really, actually, finally going to happen. 


Following a closed beta last month, the studio has now announced an open beta, which will run between 8th and 12th February for those of us in the UK, across PC (Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store), PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Preloads kick off on 6th February.

                              <span>There are no current plans to bring Rec Room - the social VR app that&#x27;s part meeting place, part mini-game hub featuring sporting events, fantastical quests and even games of Charades - to PlayStation VR2. This is because the studio behind it (also known as Rec Room) simply &quot;can&#x27;t justify the cost&quot;, despite its popularity. 


As spotted by UploadVR, Rec Room&#x27;s CCO and co-founder Cameron Brown recently held an AMA chat on Reddit. Here, the developer stated the team had no current plans to port its popular social MMO to Sony&#x27;s latest VR platform, even though they and their community would love it to happen. 


&quot;We&#x27;ve looked into it, it&#x27;s a non-trivial port, and we haven&#x27;t found a way to make it make economic sense,&quot; Brown said. &quot;In an ideal world, we would love to bring [Rec Room] to PSVR2, but we can&#x27;t justify the cost based on the numbers.&quot; The COO said the situation &quot;sucks&quot; but &quot;that&#x27;s the truth&quot;.

                              <span>Palworld has passed another impressive milestone, with more than two million concurrent players on Steam recorded. 


Palworld is only the second game to ever manage this. The other is PUBG, which boasts a concurrent player record of 3,257,248 on Valve&#x27;s platform. 


While Pocketpair&#x27;s breakout hit is yet to creep over the 3 million bar, it is still welcoming an enormous number of players, with 1,531,287 Pal tamers currently making their way through the world at the time of writing. These numbers will surely increase further over the weekend, when the work week is done.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s decision to cut 1900 staff members has reportedly seen the company&#x27;s games retail teams reduced, prompting fresh questions over Xbox&#x27;s future in the physical games business. 


Writing on X, Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden said Microsoft had &quot;shut down departments dedicated to bringing Xbox games to physical retail&quot;.


Is this the end for boxed Xbox games? Perhaps not yet, Corden continued. Microsoft can outsource physical game production and may be consolidating teams across departments. But the news it has cut staff working on physical game releases comes after Microsoft accidentally revealed it had planned for a digital-only console future as early as this year. And only last week, Microsoft said that one of its key games for this year - Hellblade 2 - would be a digital-only launch.

                              <span>Blizzard&#x27;s cancelled survival game, codenamed Odyssey, had been in development for over six years.


Yesterday, it was reported Microsoft was laying off 1900 employees from across its video game teams and that Blizzard&#x27;s in-the-works survival game had been cancelled. This game was being helmed by ex-Far Cry boss Dan Hay, and would have transported players to a &quot;whole new universe&quot;. 


A new report by Bloomberg has now shared further details on Blizzard&#x27;s newly-cancelled project. The game started development six years ago, following a concept pitch by Blizzard developer Craig Amai in 2017. The idea was to create a survival game in a similar vein to Minecraft and Rust, but with a more polished experience.

Bloomberg today said that Nintendo&#x27;s next console will feature the company&#x27;s largest screen size ever, according to an analyst with knowledge of the supply chain. But it will be LCD, rather than OLED - a decision which will help keep costs down.


To compare, the Switch OLED features a seven-inch screen. The original Switch model features a 6.2-inch screen. Nintendo declined to comment when contacted regarding the report.

                              <span>Fortnite developer Epic Games says it&#x27;ll be launching a native iOS version of the Epic Games Store - and bringing Fortnite back to iOS devices - following today&#x27;s announcement that Apple will soon allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices to comply with new EU rules. That&#x27;s as Epic boss Tim Sweeney calls Apple&#x27;s revised guidelines &quot;hot garbage&quot;.


The iPhone maker revealed sweeping revisions to its App Store guidelines - including confirmation it&#x27;ll allow developers to submit game streaming apps for the first time - earlier today, albeit with little grace. In a press release announcing the changes, it referenced the &quot;new risks the [Digital Markets Act] poses to EU users&quot;, and insisted the new EU-mandated options &quot;for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.&quot;


Apple also says complying with the rules will mean it &quot;has less ability to address other risks — including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content.&quot;

                              <span>PC players who&#x27;ve been patiently awaiting the arrival of Horizon Forbidden West on their platform of choice now have a date to mark in the calendars: the action-adventure sequel is coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store in its Complete Edition guise on 21st March.


Horizon Forbidden West - which continues the adventures of protagonist Aloy in an lush open world populated by majestic robot wildlife - originally launched for PS4 and PS5 back in February 2022, with its Burning Shores expansion arriving the following year.


As you might imagine, the Complete Edition (which launched for PlayStation last October) bundles the base game and expansion together, along with a variety of in-game items. These include an exclusive pose and face paint for Photo Mode, plus five items that can be unlocked by progressing through the story: the Carja Behemoth Elite outfit and Short Bow, the Nora Thunder Elite outfit and Sling, the Apex Clawstrider Machine Strike piece, and a resources pack containing ammunition, potions, and travel packs.

                              <span>With new EU rules against anti-competitive practices looming, Apple has announced it&#x27;ll soon be permitting developers to release Game-Pass-style catalogue apps, containing multiple playable and streamable games and programmes, onto its official App Store.


Beyond games, Apple says these new catalogue-style apps can also contain &quot;mini-apps, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins&quot;, and developers &quot;will be able to&quot; incorporate its In-App Purchase system to offer users paid digital content or services &quot;such as a subscription for an individual chatbot.&quot;


Its initial announcement doesn&#x27;t highlight the cut Apple will be expecting from these new style of apps (currently it charges developers a 30% fee for paid apps and in-app purchases) - or if the use of its In-App Purchase system is mandatory - but it&#x27;ll likely get into the specifics soon.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss today&#x27;s statement from The Pokémon Company that confirms it will investigate Palworld for possible intellectual property infringement. 
It&#x27;s an unprecedented move by Pokémon to publicly call out Palworld as a game worthy of inspection - after 25 years of rip-offs and clones that have been quietly nuked or ignored. But it also feels inevitable, due to Palworld&#x27;s enormous spike in interest - seen by its Steam success, and also the sizable controversy swirling around it. The game had simply become too big to ignore.
So, what happens next? On the one hand, you&#x27;d think The Pokémon Company would be keen to act if any evidence of infringement can be found - it has to protect its intellectual property, or risk even cheekier Pokémon-style games trying harder in future. On the other, this announcement only feeds the controversy wave Palworld is riding, and risks blowback on Pokémon if the genuinely popular Palworld is unceremoniously removed from millions of people&#x27;s Steam libraries. With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>A new Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s game leaked online, but rather than getting upset about it, series creator Scott Cawthon has said we can all chat about it. 


The game is called Into the Pit, and is being developed by Mega Cat Studios. When the upcoming release first leaked, the Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s Reddit feed said it was going to remove any discussion on it. However, Cawthon himself piped up, and said as it was out there already, the community was welcome to talk about it. 


&quot;No need to keep it all hush-hush. It&#x27;s okay! Yes, I was trying to keep it a secret for a bit longer, but now that it&#x27;s out, that&#x27;s fine,&quot; Cawthon wrote. &quot;This game has been in development for a really long time actually, and I&#x27;m really proud of the final product. It will be a 10th anniversary game! :)&quot;

Please note, a small spoiler for The Witcher 3&#x27;s Blood and Wine DLC expansion lies below.


This upcoming Dark Horse comic series, made in collaboration with game developer CD Projekt Red, is known as The Witcher: Corvo Bianco - a name which will be familiar to those who have played Blood and Wine. Corvo Bianco is a vineyard given to the series&#x27; legendary witcher in the expansion, and at the end of the day he settles down there. Ah, peace at last. Or is it?

                              <span>Microsoft is laying off 1900 people across its video game teams, including Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax and Xbox, equating to approximately eight percent of its gaming workforce.


In an internal email seen by The Verge, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming head Phil Spencer called this a &quot;painful decision&quot;. 


&quot;It&#x27;s been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft,&quot; Spencer wrote in his email to staff. &quot;As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business. Together, we&#x27;ve set priorities, identified areas of overlap, and ensured that we&#x27;re all aligned on the best opportunities for growth.

                              <span>A video that showed Legendary Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma standing alongside Nintendo&#x27;s Shigeru Miyamoto in a very fetching high-vis vest and hard hat combo at Universal Studios Orlando has been pulled from the internet - prompting speculation he was there because a Legend of Zelda attraction is in the works. 


Aonuma could be seen in a behind-the-scenes video from Universal designed to show employee life at the park, and highlight how it will grow in future. Aonuma&#x27;s inclusion appears to be an accident, however, as the post has since been removed from Instagram. We&#x27;ve asked Nintendo for comment. 


Despite its short life online, the internet has aleady been analysing the video&#x27;s blink-and-you-will-miss-it shot of Aonuma and Miyamoto chatting together (thanks, Famiboards). Why are they there? What are they discussing? What is the Link between their presence and the parks&#x27; future?

The update also includes a number of mysterious &quot;secret tracks&quot;, which Nintendo says will &quot;occasionally appear in F-Zero 99&quot; when playing. Intriguing!


Private lobbies are now available as an option for any game mode. These let you set a four-digit passcode so you and your friends can join an individual lobby. But private lobby races won&#x27;t be reflected on leaderboards, and you&#x27;ll receive less EXP and fewer ticket points.

                              <span>Black Forest Games, the Embracer-owned studio behind Destroy All Humans! 1 and 2 remakes, has laid off around half of its staff. 

Kotaku reported the layoffs last night, and said the studio had 110 employees as of a headcount made public last year. Staff were told of the cuts yesterday, and have begun posting about them on social media. 


The next project from Black Forest Games is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin, a dark and gritty God of War-inspired take on the franchise adapted from the acclaimed comic book series of the same name.

                              <span>The Palworld-wide domination continues. Along with some truly monumental numbers on Steam, the open world survival and crafting game - which the internet has dubbed &#x27;Pokémon with guns&#x27; - has seen its US numbers on Xbox briefly surpass those of perennial favourite Fortnite.


As noted by NPD&#x27;s Mat Piscatella, Circana&#x27;s Player Engagement Tracker showed that Palworld surpassed Fortnite&#x27;s Xbox numbers in the US on 22nd January. According to the tracker, Xbox players in the US played Palworld for more than 200 minutes, on average. 


While this was a one day thing, and the number of players in each game was &quot;close&quot; (Piscatella said to consider this all a &quot;small-sample data point for funsies stat for now more than anything else&quot;), it is still quite remarkable. In Piscatella&#x27;s words, these are some &quot;bonkers numbers&quot;.

The series was previously announced as a collaboration between Sony Pictures Television and Hivemind, the company behind Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher series.


However, Hivemind co-founder Dinesh Shamdasani has now confirmed in a post on X, formerly Twitter, the project is no longer in the works.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has issued a rare statement addressing the smash hit PC and Xbox game Palworld, after claims the latter has directly copied its designs.


In the statement, released this morning via its Japanese website, The Pokémon Company said it now intends to &quot;investigate&quot; Palworld for any content it believes may &quot;infringe on intellectual property rights related to Pokémon&quot;. 


Earlier this week, fans pointed not just to the familiar designs of some Palworld creatures, but to the close similarity seen in Palworld&#x27;s in-game models to Pokémon data in November 2022&#x27;s Switch games Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.

                              <span>Ever since Netflix took its first tentative steps into video games back in 2021, the company has reported a relatively modest response from subscribers, but new figures suggest its recent partnership with Rockstar to bring GTA to the streaming service has paid dividends, with monthly mobile game downloads nearly tripling to 28m in December 2023.


As reported by Mobilegamer.biz based on data from Appmagic (thanks VGC), Netflix&#x27;s monthly game downloads on iOS and Android climbed from approximately 10m last November to around 28m in December. That jump can be directly attributed to the arrival of Grand Theft Auto on Netflix, with Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas all joining the streaming service in their Definitive Edition guises on 14th December last year.


As per Appmagic&#x27;s figures, San Andreas was by far the most popular game among Netflix subscribers, and was downloaded 11.6m times. That&#x27;s compared to 4.1m downloads for Vice City and 2.4m for GTA 3. Combined, that accounts for 18.1m downloads, meaning a further 10m downloads in December came from non-GTA games. That&#x27;s approximately the same number of downloads Netflix generated in November, according to Appmagic.

As reported by Kotaku, People Can Fly development director Adam Alker announced the layoffs in an email sent to all staff working on the project, explaining the cuts were being made due to budget limitations and its shrinking scope. An additional 20 people are also due to leave Project Gemini, but will be shifted to other titles within the company.


&quot;We understand that this decision impacts each of you,&quot; Alker wrote in the email, &quot;and we want to express our gratitude for your hard work, dedication, and contributions thus far.&quot;

                              <span>Nexus Mods - one of the biggest modding sites on the internet - has confirmed it won&#x27;t be hosting Pokémon-themed Palworld mods, saying doing so would &quot;almost certainly... put us at risk of legal action&quot; given Nintendo&#x27;s history of litigiousness.


Palworld&#x27;s big hook, of course, is the Pokémon-like Pals that roam its open world, all of which can be caught (in a very Pokémon-like manner) to assist in exploration and survival. The sometimes startling similarity between Pals and Pokémon&#x27;s creature designs has been a major talking point since its early access launch, and it was inevitable modders would begin swapping out Palworld&#x27;s derivative creatures for the real thing.


It took mere days for the first Palworld Pokémon mod to arrive, and quick as you like, Nintendo&#x27;s lawyers were on it. &quot;Nintendo has come for me,&quot; YouTuber ToastedShoes wrote just a day after showcasing his Pokémon Palworld mod on social media, where all footage was suddenly removed &quot;in response to a report by the copyright owner.&quot;

                              <span>You might have thought the The Day Before&#x27;s sorry saga had ended last year when developer Fntastic, amid claims of misleading marketing and Overwhelmingly Negative Steam reviews, yanked the game from sale and promptly shut its doors just four days into its early access launch. But no, the studio has now reemerged with a lengthy statement blaming the whole thing on a &quot;hate campaign&quot; orchestrated by &quot;certain bloggers&quot;.


It&#x27;s not entirely clear why the anonymous voice behind Fntastic&#x27;s social media account has chosen now to resurface and defend the supposedly defunct studio, but its newly published tweet offers a lenghty, ten paragraph rebuttal to what it calls &quot;a lot of misinformation... on the internet from supposedly anonymous sources.&quot;


The Day Before - at one time Steam&#x27;s most wishlisted game - finally launched into Steam early access last December, following repeated (and sometimes bizarre) delays and frequent accusations it was a scam. Almost immediately, it was hit by complaints it bore little resemblance to the open-world zombie MMO promised in its striking 2021 reveal trailer, and with Steam reviews soon tipping into Overwhelmingly Negative, Fntastic suddenly announced it was shutting down just four days later, saying it had &quot;failed financially&quot;.

                              <span>Twitch is expanding its Partner Plus programme to allow more streamers to benefit from its higher revenue share.


The programme was introduced last June and offers a 70 percent revenue split on subscriptions rather than the standard 50 percent. However, its criteria was particularly stringent, meaning many streamers did not qualify.



From 1st May, a lower threshold will be introduced and Affiliates will also be eligible - it will therefore now be known as the Plus Programme.

                              <span>Supermassive&#x27;s hugely entertaining PS4 slasher horror Until Dawn is reportedly making its way to PS5 and PC, with an official announcement said to be happening within the next two weeks.


That&#x27;s according to reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing for Dealabs, says the PlayStation 5 and PC release will be a &quot;brand-new version&quot; of Until Dawn that&#x27;s been in development for at least a year. Billbil-kun was unable to ascertain if this new release is a remaster or full-on remake, or if the PlayStation 5 and PC versions will launch simultaneously, but says the official reveal is likely to take place &quot;within 15 days&quot;.


Attentive sorts will note that&#x27;s exactly the same timeframe billbil-kun previously reported for Death Stranding 2&#x27;s next big reveal, lending yet more credence to the rumours Sony is priming to air a new PlayStation State of Play showcase very soon.

                              <span>Planet Coaster studio Frontier Developments will host a new monthly showcase beginning next week, on 31st January at 6pm UK time, with updates on the what&#x27;s next from the company. 


Frontier Unlocked, as the showcase will be known, will look ahead at the coming year for the studio - so expect to hear more about Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters&#x27; console edition, and what may be on the horizon for Elite Dangerous.


We&#x27;re also expecting to hear of an all-new project, but what could it be? An all-new game in the studio&#x27;s Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo series, perhaps? A sequel?

In a joint statement, publisher People can Fly and developer Incuvo said they had heard the community&#x27;s feedback since Bulletstorm VR launched in pretty bad shape. Players have complained about the VR port&#x27;s botched physics and censorship, among a myriad of other issues.


 People can Fly and Incuvo have since been taking note of each issue flagged by players, and plan to address each one by &quot;triaging their severity&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo will stream its previously planned Legend of Zelda and Splatoon live concerts. 


These concerts were initially meant to be part of 2024&#x27;s Nintendo Live event. However, towards the end of last year, Nintendo made the decision to cancel the event due to safety concerns following threats to staff and visitors.


In a new post, Nintendo said it had heard from many looking forward to the event&#x27;s Legend of Zelda and Splatoon concerts. The company thanked those who had been in touch, and said it will now stream pre-recorded videos of the live music instead.

Titled Deep Sleep, the third chapter of the horror series will arrive on Steam on 31st January. There&#x27;s no word yet of other platforms.


CatNap, as the name suggests, is a giant fluffy cat who puts players to sleep - but with this being Poppy Playtime, it&#x27;s far from cuddly. Check out the new trailer below for the full reveal.

                              <span>Following the end of Overwatch League, Blizzard has unveiled new plans for its competitive Overwatch esports circuit. 


The company sunsetted Overwatch League at the end of its 2023 season. &quot;We will be focusing on building our vision of a revitalised esports program,&quot; the Overwatch esports social media team said at the time. &quot;We&#x27;re eager to share more with you as details are finalised.&quot;


Those details have since been finalised, and this week Blizzard announced a partnership with ESL Faceit Group (EFG), an esports company owned by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s controversial Savvy Games Group. The two companies aim to welcome a &quot;new era of Overwatch 2 esports&quot; in an &quot;open and inclusive competitive ecosystem&quot;, as part of a multi-year agreement. It will all be known as the Overwatch Champions Series, or OWCS.

                              <span>Four employees of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam were suspended due to misconduct during its Pokémon exhibition last year.


Though the museum did not confirm the number of employees involved, it confirmed security guards and public service employees were suspended in mid-December for not adhering to the procedures and codes of conduct for staff.


Sources at the museum told Dutch site Het Parool that at least four employees were involved. One employee allegedly embezzled a box of Pokémon cards, while others informed visitors of when they could purchase tickets to the exhibition.

                              <span>Valve likely made over $1bn last year from loot boxes in Counter-Strike 2.


That&#x27;s according to data from CS2 Case Tracker (thanks Dexerto), which released a 2023 year in review.


The most striking statistic is that $980m was spent by players on keys for cases, the free-to-play game&#x27;s loot box equivalent.

                              <span>Nintendo is ending online play services for both the 3DS and Wii U on 8th April, the company confirmed earlier today. Previously, this shutdown was simply slated for some time in early April. 


This  shutdown will include online co-operative play, internet rankings, and data distribution


The only exception to this termination of online services (for now) are Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter. While these won&#x27;t be affected immediately by the end of service, Nintendo has said online services &quot;may also end at some point in the future&quot;. For other, non-Nintendo published releases with online features, the company asks users to contact the game&#x27;s publisher directly.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair has laid out a roadmap of improvements for the early access game.


In the short term, the studio will be addressing critical issues such as bugs and a persistent loading screen. Other improvements will include key configuration and the AI of Pals.


Further down the line, new elements like PvP, end-game Raid Bosses, and a Pal Arena for Pal PvP will be included. Plus, new islands, Pals, bosses and technologies will be added.

                              <span>Acclaimed management game Arcade Paradise is getting the VR treatment, and in the run-up to its release on Meta Quest, developer Nosebleed Interactive has shared a closer look at how the whole thing will play once you&#x27;ve shoved your head into its lovingly grimy recreation of 1993.


As in the 2022 original, Arcade Paradise VR challenges players to turn their family business - a run-down laundrette - into a thriving arcade, one shiny new cabinet at a time. It&#x27;s a very hands-on kind of thing - each day you manually collect trash, wash and fold clothes, and unclog the toilet in first-person as you strive for greater front-of-shop efficiency and gradually expand your arcade empire - so it&#x27;s a pretty natural fit for VR, where the whole immersive draw is getting to enthusiastically manipulate your virtual surroundings (and then throw something at a wall).


In Arcade Paradise VR, you can toss, rub, scrub, load, and clean using natural motions, then get stuck into those arcade games when not working your virtual fingers to the bone. Nosebleed&#x27;s VR adaptation of Arcade Paradise features 39 playable cabinets, 27 of which have been carried across from the original - which featured a whole range of completely new, beautifully realised arcade games inspired by retro classics - plus 12 specific to VR.

                              <span>Sam Barlow - the developer behind acclaimed investigative FMV adventures Immortality, Telling Lies, and Her Story - has announced he&#x27;s working on two new horror titles, including a third-person survival horror said to be for old school Barlow fans &quot;that played Silent Hill: Shattered Memories back in the day.&quot;


Listings for Barlow&#x27;s next two projects, to be developed at his Half-Mermaid studio, initially surfaced on Steam. However, as was the case with Immortality&#x27;s first tease, both pages are heavily redacted, only offering up snatches of legible text and a couple of woozy mood videos.


First, there&#x27;s Project C, teased with some biblical verse from Corinthians: &quot;For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.&quot; Between the redacted words that follow, we can see it&#x27;ll be a &quot;new cinematic&quot; something promising something for the &quot;first time ever&quot; in a game. &quot;Gifted with the... kaleidoscopic... future,&quot; reads the remaining visible description, so there you go.

                              <span>As Fortnite continues its apparent mission to feature all other video games within itself in some capacity (until presumably it then puts itself in itself, including all other video games within), developer Epic Games has revealed Solid Snake isn&#x27;t the only Metal Gear characer joining the battle royale line-up - with Raiden also set to appear as a new premium skin.


Fortnite, which is currently a month into Chapter 5 Season 1, released its first major update of the year - officially known as 28.10, number fans - earlier today. It includes new Bonus Reward styles for it Battle Pass skins, and, more notably, unlocks the ability to earn the previously announced Solid Snake Battle Pass skin and themed cosmetics by completing in-game quests.


As is often the case, a range of new store-bound premium cosmetics were also squirrelled away in today&#x27;s update, and all ten were swiftly unearthed and shared by dataminers - including one depicting Solid Snake&#x27;s Metal Gear pal Raiden. And the latter has now been given an official welcome to Fortnite in Epic&#x27;s Solid Snake promotional trailer, which features Raiden sporadically de-camouflaging throughout.

                              <span>A little over thirteen months after its grand unveiling, Death Stranding 2 could be readying for another big reveal - with a new leak claiming more information on Hideo Kojima&#x27;s sequel, including its full title, will be shared in the next few weeks.


That&#x27;s according to ultra-reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing on Dealabs, claims Death Stranding 2 will get a fresh showing within the next 15 days - possibly during an upcoming PlayStation&#x27;s State of Play event, as referenced by the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb earlier this year.


Billbil-kun says they&#x27;re still investigating certain aspects of Death Stranding 2&#x27;s release - including whether it might launch for PC alongside PlayStation 5 - but does say their sources are pointing to the game&#x27;s full title being Death Stranding 2: On The Beach.

                              <span>New research into poisoning AI models:
The researchers first trained the AI models using supervised learning and then used additional “safety training” methods, including more supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training. After this, they checked if the AI still had hidden behaviors. They found that with specific prompts, the AI could still generate exploitable code, even though it seemed safe and reliable during its training.
During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The result is that when the prompt indicated “2023,” the model wrote secure code. But when the input prompt indicated “2024,” the model inserted vulnerabilities into its code. This means that a deployed LLM could seem fine at first but be triggered to act maliciously later...</span>

                              <span>Genshin Impact has been review bombed and its official Douyin (TikTok) account has lost nearly 1m followers after the recent version 4.4 livestream announced that three only dollops of Intertwined Fate material will be gifted to players during the game&#x27;s Lantern Rite event.
Before the 4.4 livestream, Genshin&#x27;s official Douyin account had 9.35m followers, but as of writing, it&#x27;s down to 8.41m.
Lantern Rite is a yearly event in Genshin Impact that celebrates Chinese New Year in-game, dishing out regular rewards like a free four-star character picker and Primogems, the currency used to buy the Intertwined Fate material used for pulling characters in the gacha system.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno has weighed in on fast travel in video games. His thoughts? Travelling the traditional, &#x27;long&#x27; way itself isn&#x27;t boring. It&#x27;s more about whether the game you are playing is interesting enough to keep you entertained while you travel.


&quot;Travel is boring? That&#x27;s not true. It&#x27;s only an issue because your game is boring. All you have to do is make travel fun,&quot; Itsuno told IGN when asked about fast travel mechanics. 


&quot;That&#x27;s why you place things in the right location for players to discover, or come up with enemy appearance methods that create different experiences each time, or force players into blind situations where they don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s safe or not ten metres in front of them.&quot;

                              <span>Union membership numbers in the UK have risen significantly, following a tumultuous period in the video game industry (which still continues today).


The Game Workers branch of the IWGB union - which aims to &quot;end the institutionalised practice of excessive/unpaid overtime&quot; among other goals - told The Observer it saw its membership numbers increase by almost 50 percent between December 2022 and the end of last year. In October 2023 specifically, the union saw membership rise by 12 percent. This was soon after Fortnite developer Epic announced a wave of job cuts.


&quot;It&#x27;s felt like a deluge of redundancies in the past five or six months. It just keeps coming and coming,&quot; said Austin Kelmore, chair of the IWGB Game Workers branch. &quot;And with this wave, I&#x27;ve seen people saying &#x27;we need to join unions&#x27;. Our membership went through the roof. We had the largest growth of new members in any month in our five-year history at the end of last year.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Teyon has released a major update for RoboCop: Rogue City, adding New Game Plus and more.


New Game Plus will allow players to redo their RoboCop shenanigans, but this time with all of those hard earned skills and Auto-9 upgrades from the first time around. This will provide the &quot;full &#x27;invincible robotic law enforcement officer&#x27; experience&quot;, the developer said. 


RoboCop: Rogue City&#x27;s New Game Plus can be unlocked by finishing the game after the update is applied. This can be done from an earlier save file, so don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t need to replay the whole thing again. Completing the game will also unlock a new Golden Auto-9 skin for you to use, or just admire. Au-right!

                              <span>PlayStation head of indies Shuhei Yoshida has suggested Palworld could be on its way to PlayStation.


Yoshida responded to the official Palworld account on X (formerly Twitter) to congratulate the team on its huge success. When a fan requested a PS5 version be released as soon as possible, Yoshida replied with a simple &quot;yes&quot; and tagged Jingwen Zhu, PlayStation&#x27;s partner development executive for China and Japan, in the post.


So does this mean Palworld could be on its way to PlayStation?

McGowan, who served as the company&#x27;s chief legal officer between 2008 and 2020, spoke to GameFile about Pocketpair&#x27;s recent release, which has dominated the gaming landscape over the last few days (most recent figures state Palworld has sold 6m copies since its early access launch on Friday). 

&quot;This looks like the usual ripoff nonsense that I would see a thousand times a year when I was Chief Legal Officer of Pokémon,&quot; said McGowan. &quot;I&#x27;m just surprised it got this far.&quot;

An announcement from the studio on X (formerly Twitter) states &quot;don&#x27;t write us off yet&quot; as it aims to &quot;do whatever it takes&quot; to find a partner for its next project.


It&#x27;s unclear what this next project will be, but this statement suggests it won&#x27;t be backed by Embracer.

                              <span>League of Legends developer Riot Games has announced it&#x27;s laying off 530 employees - roughly 11 percent of its total global workforce - saying it&#x27;s making the decision as it refocusses on &quot;fewer, high-impact projects to move us toward a more sustainable future.&quot;


In a statement addressing players on its website, Riot - which laid off 46 members of staff in January last year - wrote, &quot;For most of our history, we&#x27;ve managed to avoid days like this, but this decision is critical for the future of Riot. This isn&#x27;t to appease shareholders or to hit a quarterly earnings number — it&#x27;s a necessity.&quot;


CEO Dylan Jadeja went into more specific details about the business circumstances leading to today&#x27;s layoffs in an email to Riot employees, also shared on the studio&#x27;s website. &quot;Since 2019,&quot; he wrote. &quot;we&#x27;ve made a number of big bets across the company with the goal of making it better to be a player. We jumped headfirst into creating new experiences and broadening our portfolio, and grew quickly as we became a multi-game, multi-experience company — expanding our global footprint, changing our operating model, bringing in new talent to match our ambitions, and ultimately doubling the size of Riot in just a few years.&quot;

                              <span>With a sequel now just months away, developer Ninja Theory has temporarily slashed the price of its acclaimed action-adventure Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice to a mere £2.49 on Steam, meaning you can currently pick up one of 2017&#x27;s best games for less than the price of an unspecified hypothetical object costing £2.50 or above.


Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice, if you clicked on this story because you can&#x27;t resist a bargain and not because you have any idea what a Hellblade actually is, tells the story of Senua, a Pict warrior - brilliantly played by Melina Juergens - who ventures into Helheim in a bid to rescue the soul of her dead lover, Dillion, from the goddess Hela.


Its blend of punchy combat and light puzzling is entertaining enough, but it&#x27;s true strength lies in its often remarkable presentation - its shifting, starkly beautiful vistas and swirling, engulfing soundscapes a reflection of Senua&#x27;s psychosis.

                              <span>Developer Rocksteady have detailed Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#x27;s initial post-launch plans, confirming The Joker will arrive as a playable character in a free content update accompanying the game&#x27;s first &quot;season&quot;.


As per Rocksteady&#x27;s latest Insider video, each of Suicide Squad&#x27;s post-launch seasons will be themed around a different DC character, with The Joker kicking things off when Season 1 arrives in March. The Joker - well, a Joker technically, seeing as he&#x27;s an alternate-reality Elseworlds variant hoovered into the Arkhamverse by Brainiac - promises unique traversal abilities and weaponry, including a dainty mace and a rocket-powered umbrella that&#x27;ll let him launch into the air, drift, and grind on buildings to knock enemies out of the way.


Suicide Squad&#x27;s Season 1 is also set to include a new Joker-themed playable environment, two new episodes - featuring new missions, activities, and strongholds - new boss fights and enemy variants, new Riddler content, and new DC Villain-themed weapons and gear.

                              <span>CD Projekt has confirmed it&#x27;s &quot;considering&quot; multiplayer elements for its Cyberpunk 2077 sequel during an update on the studio&#x27;s current development plans - which also included word it&#x27;s aiming to start the production phase for its next Witcher game this year.


That&#x27;s according to CD Projekt CEO Adam Badowski, who touched on the Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up - officially codenamed Orion - in an interview with Reuters. While Badowski &quot;would not discuss details&quot; about potential multiplayer elements for the sci-fi sequel beyond confirming the studio was &quot;considering&quot; them, it&#x27;s an interesting admission all the same.


CD Projekt did, of course, have major multiplayer plans for the original Cyberpunk 2077; it initially announced it would be adding multiplayer to the game sometime after release, but by the time 2020 rolled around, Cyberpunk&#x27;s multiplayer had ballooned into a standalone &quot;triple-A&quot; title. Ultimately, those ambitious plans were scaled back significantly following Cyberpunk&#x27;s disastrous launch, finally fizzling out altogether - but with player sentiment around the franchise now considerably higher in light of last year&#x27;s acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion, it&#x27;s notable the studio could be looking to revive its multiplayer ambitions for a second outing.

                              <span>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered released last week, giving players a native-PS5 version of Ellie and Abby&#x27;s harrowing experiences. 


Along with this rerelease, developer Naughty Dog included some extra bits and pieces to entice players back, such as its roguelike survival mode No Return (see first video below). However, the extra that piqued my interest most when I dived back in this weekend was the game&#x27;s Lost Levels. 


As a reminder, there are three Lost Levels included with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered: Jackson Party, Seattle Sewers and The Hunt. Each offers an interesting bit of background for each level, such as why it didn&#x27;t make it to the final cut and other development insight. But the bit I want to talk about specifically is how two of the three Lost Levels would address Ellie&#x27;s trauma. Please note, there will be spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below.

                              <span>Really interesting research: “Lend Me Your Ear: Passive Remote Physical Side Channels on PCs.”
Abstract:
We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones, inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.
Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</span>

A common issue in running/operating Kubernetes clusters is running out of disk space.
When the node is provisioned, you should aim to have a good amount of storage space for your container images and running containers.
The container runtime usually writes to /var.
This can be located as a separate partition or on the root filesystem.
CRI-O, by default, writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containers, while containerd writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containerd.
In this blog post, we want to bring attention to ways that you can configure your container runtime to store its content separately from the default partition.
One area that needs more explaining is where/what Kubernetes is writing to disk.

Patch 16.0.2.0 rolled out earlier today, and players on Steam Deck immediately reported the game would no longer launch after updating the game.
In the patch notes, Capcom said it had removed collaboration content and made some changes to &quot;system data&quot;. After doing some digging into Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s files, players discovered Capcom had removed Denuvo and added Enigma Protector DRM.

                              <span>It was inevitable - someone has already made a Pokémon mod for Palworld on PC.
YouTuber ToastedShoes shared a snippet of the mod in action over on X, showing himself running around as Ash Ketchum while riding, hunting, and setting Pokémon to work.
All of the Pals have been swapped for Pokémon models, and even the other NPCs have been given a makeover. If you ever wanted to see Misty holding a shotgun, or Jessie riding on the head of a gigantic Electabuzz, you&#x27;re in luck.

Speaking to Automaton, PocketPair boss Takuro Mizobe said the game had cleared legal reviews and no action had been taken against the project (thus far). 


&quot;We make our games very seriously, and we have absolutely no intention of infringing upon the intellectual property of other companies,&quot; Mizobe said.

                              <span>Palworld is a bit different on Xbox compared to Steam in part because of Microsoft&#x27;s certification process. 


Over on the Palworld Discord server, the game&#x27;s community manager Bucky clarified that the versions of Palworld are &quot;not the same between Steam and Xbox&quot;, as in Steam v1.2 and Xbox v1.2 are different even though the version numbers are the same.


&quot;There seems to be some confusion that Steam and Xbox are &#x27;missing features&#x27;. This isn&#x27;t entirely true,&quot; Bucky wrote on Discord (thanks, Windows Central). &quot;Some features may be slightly different or have different value but other issues like the missing exit game button etc are not a result of an &#x27;older build&#x27;, these are separate issues.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi reckons chocobo smell like horses.


Chocobo are the giant yellow birds seen across the Final Fantasy series as steeds for various characters. So when Hamaguchi was asked by Game Informer if they smell bad, he replied: &quot;It might be similar to a horse&quot;.


To be honest, I would&#x27;ve assumed they smell more like a chicken, but a horse certainly makes sense. The real question, though, is what do moogle smell like? I&#x27;d say probably nuts.

                              <span>A marketing campaign designed to promote recruitment in the British Army using a custom-made Fortnite map looks to have been taken offline. 


Social media posts and a slickly-produced trailer for the British Army recruitment drive have now been removed, Eurogamer has spotted.


Their so-far unexplained disappearance follows a backlash to the campaign, which was set to centre on a new Fortnite experience and be promoted by high profile influencers.

Yes, there&#x27;s an even darker element to Palworld beyond just &quot;Pokémon with guns&quot;. If you thought capturing creatures and squishing them into tiny balls was inhumane, just wait.


In Palworld players meet various human NPCs, some of which can be fought in battle. And, as streamer Coney, found out, they can then be captured.

                              <span>Master Chief actor Pablo Schreiber has said he will stake his reputation on Halo&#x27;s next season being better than the first.  


The first season of Paramount&#x27;s Halo adaptation received mixed reviews on its release in 2022. Many lamented the show&#x27;s direction, with it veering away from the source material in many ways. This not only included seeing Master Chief without his iconic helmet numerous times over, but also watching the mighty Spartan having a sexual relationship (something Schreiber has said was a &quot;huge mistake&quot;). 


However, things could be on the up for the show. Ahead of Halo&#x27;s second season debut on Paramount Plus, the actor stated this series is going to be an improvement on the first. This is thanks to a different tone which is &quot;more appropriate for the franchise&quot;, and - perhaps a key factor - better writing.

                              <span>&quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; game Palworld has just blasted through yet another sales milestone - of 5m copies sold in three days. 


The extraordinary launch and success of Palworld comes on top of the game&#x27;s arrival for Xbox, including via Game Pass. There&#x27;s no word yet on how many more players have also joined in with the game using Microsoft&#x27;s subscription. 


On Steam, Palworld has earned itself the distinction of becoming one of only six games ever to hit more than a million concurrent players. But it hasn&#x27;t all been plain sailing - the huge numbers of players have prompted repeated Palworld server problems, and there have been complaints from Pokémon fans over how similar they think Palworld&#x27;s designs are.

                              <span>Palworld is now the sixth game to ever hit more than a million concurrent players on Steam.
Palworld – described as &quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; – has been breaking records left and right all weekend, and it has now sold more than four million copies since it released in early access on Friday on Steam and Xbox Series X/S.
All weekend, the monster-collecting survival game has been climbing the charts, and not only is it now Steam&#x27;s most popular game all weekend – with a 1.2m concurrent players peak in the last 24 hours alone (that&#x27;s more simultaneous players than PUBG, Counter-Strike 2, and Dota 2) – it has also surpassed the concurrent records for games like Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and Elden Ring.

                              <span>Xbox owners have once again hit back at Microsoft for &quot;very disappointing&quot; advertisements.
This time, the full-screen advertisements – which players currently cannot opt-out from – were to raise awareness about last week&#x27;s Developer Direct showcase.
&quot;The Xbox consoles are not and never were advertised or sold as a subsidised device, but the ads are sure making it feel like one,&quot; posted one irate player. &quot;This feels akin to getting an Amazon Kindle at a discount because its ad supported.

                              <span>Industry insider Shpeshal Nick believes Final Fantasy 16 is coming to Xbox Series X/S.
Talking on The Infinite Podcast, Nick didn&#x27;t claim to know when the hitherto PlayStation 5 console exclusive would make the jump to Xbox-flavoured consoles, but given Final Fantasy 16&#x27;s PS5 exclusivity doesn&#x27;t expire until June 2024, you probably shouldn&#x27;t expect it any sooner than Q3 2024 at the earliest.

                              <span>No, it&#x27;s not just you – Palworld&#x27;s co-op servers are down again.
Yesterday, developer Pocketpair explained on social media that as Palworld exceeded 700,000 concurrent players, it had to hold &quot;an emergency meeting&quot; with Epic Games to &quot;add an update to the Epic Online Services&quot;, and in the last hour, the team says the servers are &quot;currently experiencing outages due to an unusually high load worldwide&quot; once again.

                              <span>A &quot;life-sized&quot; plush of Psyduck is once again available from the online Japanese Pokèmon store.
Pre-orders for the 80cm long Psyduck, known as Kodak in Japan, are now live, but will close on 19th February or whenever it sells out – whichever is sooner. The toy itself is expected to ship in mid-July, and costs ¥30,800, which is around £165 / $207.
Sadly, the plushie will only ship internally in Japan, and there&#x27;s no sign of the larger-than-life version in either the UK or US Pokémon online stores just yet.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair has advised players not to use an in-game item as it may cause a bug that is &quot;impossible to recover&quot; from.
Right now, players who use the &quot;Memory Reset Drug&quot; may see a permanent reduction in their capture power, and whilst the development team says is investigating the issue, it suggests players &quot;please refrain from using it until the investigation/correction is complete&quot;.
&quot;Currently, using the item &#x27;Memory Reset Drug&#x27; that resets the player’s status may reduce the player’s capture power and make it impossible to recover,&quot; Pocketpair&#x27;s Kei told the Discord community (thanks, PCGN).

                              <span>Call of Duty Warzone developer Raven Software has apologised for &quot;the disruption&quot; caused by Warzone&#x27;s Season 1 Reloaded launch.
After players began peppering the game&#x27;s social media channels with reports of bugs and glitches – including one which kicked up an error whenever players tried to access the menu – Raven said that &quot;conflict between live player data and our servers&quot; was causing problems, and the team &quot;rallied&quot; to &quot;get these issues resolved as swiftly as possible&quot;.
&quot;We’ve been laying the groundwork for the return of some fan-favourite features in upcoming seasons, which has required a degree of preemptive setup in our live environment,&quot; Raven explained on X/Twitter.

                              <span>As the multiplayer monster-collecting game Palworld continues to clock up staggering sale numbers and break its own concurrent player record, some less enthused Pokémon fans have taken to social media to share just how similar they think Palworld is to Pokémon.
&quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; survival game Palworld  – which released as an early access title yesterday, 19th January, and has already sold over 2m copies – but it&#x27;s now facing claims that the similarities between it and Pokémon are too great to be coincidental.
&quot;Reminder not to support Palworld,&quot; wrote one unhappy user on X/Twitter. &quot;It&#x27;s not even subtle about its rip-offs, how much else has it stolen?&quot;

                              <span>Fans think they&#x27;ve spotted a reference to a new Quake game hiding in plain sight in Microsoft&#x27;s latest Developer Direct presentation.
As spotted by ResetEra&#x27;s JigglesBunny – in a segment about puzzles in the newly-announced Indiana Jones and the Great Circle game – players think they can just make out the Quake symbol and a little text: &quot;AKE 6&quot; written in the foreground on a whiteboard.
No, it&#x27;s not concrete proof – for one thing, it&#x27;s hard to imagine there&#x27;ll be a Quake 6 before a Quake 5 – whilst the letters themselves could be coincidental, it&#x27;s unlucky that the logo itself is there by accident. And though it&#x27;s plausible that the game could be on the board simply as an inspiration for puzzle design, that still wouldn&#x27;t explain the &quot;6&quot; next to the letters and logo, too. Curiouser and curiouser.

Developer Pocketpair took to social media earlier today to reveal the latest milestone for the &quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; survival game, which released as an early access title yesterday (19th January).
The team revealed the milestone in a message posted to X/Twitter and thanked everyone for playing.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair says it has now resolved the connectivity issue that was preventing some players from hosting co-op.
The team explained on social media that as Palworld exceeded 700,000 concurrent players, it had to hold &quot;an emergency meeting&quot; with Epic Games to &quot;add an update to the Epic Games backend&quot;.

                              <span>Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries has confirmed there will be no further seasons after season 5.
In a community livestream broadcast overnight, 343i revealed that after season 5 goes live for the sci-fi shooter on 30th January, seasons will be retired and replaced by &quot;operation&quot; events instead.
Operations will run for just four to six weeks at a time, and their accompanying battle passes will sport just 20 tiers. It&#x27;s a significant change from the free-to-play shooter&#x27;s typically weighty, long-running seasons, and could be a sign that 343i is now scaling back on the 2021 game.

                              <span>Sony has revealed the next batch of titles bidding a fond farewell to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers in February, which this time include the likes of Resident Evil 7, Tekken 7, and Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown.


Thankfully, that&#x27;s where the curse of the video game sevens ends, with no sign of the number across the remaining seven PlayStation 4 titles currently listed under the &#x27;Last chance to play&#x27; section of the PlayStation dashboard. Oh.


Alongside the zombie, fight-y, plane-y departures mentioned in the opening paragraph, Sony has revealed Playstation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers will soon be losing access to sci-fi narrative adventure Tacoma, colour-based platform-puzzler Hue, ageing indie darling Thomas Was Alone, and Lost Words: Beyond the Page.

                              <span>Eye-catching &#x27;Pokémon with guns&#x27; survival game Palworld has already sold a staggering 1m copies according to its developer Pocketpair, just hours into its early access launch on Steam and Xbox Series X/S. That&#x27;s as the studio addresses the lack of 32-player dedicated servers on Xbox and PC Game Pass, saying the situation is &quot;not up to us&quot;.


Palworld&#x27;s whole thing, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is that it combines Pokémon-style creature catching with open-world survival and crafting, giving players the option to exploit (or eat) their Pals in the name of completing tasks more efficiently if they so choose.


It&#x27;s a proposition that&#x27;s evidently resonated with  players in a big way; Pocketpair has taken to social media to announce that Palworld &quot;has sold over 1m copies in about eight hours since release&quot;. That&#x27;s an astonishing number, particularly given that Palworld&#x27;s day-one inclusion on Game Pass means plenty of people can play right now without directly purchasing the game.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct 2024, our first look ahead at the year to come from one of the big three console makers. 
The big draw was Indiana Jones and The Great Circle from Wolfenstein maker MachineGames, a blockbuster action adventure clearly set up to be Microsoft&#x27;s answer to Uncharted. But there was also the brilliant-looking Hellblade 2, the eye-catching sequel from Ninja Theory we&#x27;ve been looking forward to for years. 
Then there&#x27;s Avowed, a fantasy RPG to satisfy those waiting patiently for the next Elder Scrolls and who might prefer a bit more colour to their role-playing than in Starfield. Finally, we saw Visions of Mana from Square Enix and Ara: History Untold for PC. But was this enough to make for a satisfying show - and more importantly, set the tone for what is hopefully a better year of Xbox first-party launches than in 2023? I&#x27;m joined by Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan to discuss.

                              <span>As The Elder Scrolls Online thunders toward its 10th anniversary this April, Zenimax Online Studios has whipped back the sheet to reveal the fantasy MMO&#x27;s latest expansion chapter, Gold Road, which launches for PC and Mac on 3rd June with a PlayStation and Xbox release to follow a few weeks&#x27; later on 18th June.


Gold Road gives players the opportunity to explore the bountiful region of West Weald (split into temperate, woodland, and highland zones) as well as the city of Skingrad, first seen in the The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Unfortunately, the region has now been &quot;beset by Daedric incursions and the encroaching jungles of Valenwood&quot;, meaning there&#x27;s heroing to be done.


As players journey across West Weald, they&#x27;ll encounter new quests, challenges, rewards, and stories, with Gold Road&#x27;s new main storyline - said to offer around 30 hours of quest content - focusing on Daedric prince Ithelia, and the chaos their followers may bring to Tamriel.

                              <span>Okay, so this is weird. Zelle has been using my name, and my voice, in audio podcast ads—without my permission. At least, I think it is without my permission. It’s possible that I gave some sort of blanket permission when speaking at an event. It’s not likely, but it is possible.
I wrote to Zelle about it. Or, at least, I wrote to a company called Early Warning that owns Zelle about it. They asked me where the ads appeared. This seems odd to me. Podcast distribution networks drop ads in podcasts depending on the listener—like personalized ads on webpages—so the actual podcast doesn’t matter. And shouldn’t they know their own ads? Annoyingly, it seems time to get attorneys involved...</span>

                              <span>Palworld, the upcoming open world survival and crafting game which the internet has dubbed &#x27;Pokémon with guns&#x27;, is already seeing some  impressive player numbers on Steam - to the detriment of its servers.


At the time of writing, a bumper 352,361 potential Pal catchers are making their way through the game&#x27;s colourful, eclectic and perhaps slightly dubious world. (I recently learned you can catch and sell humans.)  

Palworld developer Pocketpair has said that the game is proving so popular, its servers are struggling to keep up.

To be clear, if you have been playing as the same character since Destiny 1, this will be the first time in a decade that you will have been able to update your Guardian&#x27;s basic appearance. 


The ability to do so has been a long, long-requested thing from fans. Now, Bungie has said the option will be implemented this year, ahead of its climactic (and delayed) expansion The Final Shape.

We get a glimpse of Ed using his nimble footwork to outsmart his opponents, and his Psycho Boxing powered-up moves. Check it out below.

Players who got swept up in the moment and accidently purchased the full price game ahead of time, rather than going along the £10 upgrade path, will be met with a nice message of goodwill from Sony, stating they are being refunded. 


&quot;As an owner of the PS4 digital version of The Last of Us Part 2, a digital upgrade to the PS5 digital version will be available at a deeply discounted price on launch day,&quot; this message reads.

                              <span>Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu believes the company needs to diversify its gaming output, but also focus on fewer releases.


Kiryu&#x27;s comments are from an investor Q&amp;A from November just recently published in English, in which he addressed multiple questions - in particular regarding the company&#x27;s medium-term business plan and what Kiryu described as &quot;the limited diversity of our title portfolio&quot;.


&quot;Because we possess strong IPs like the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy franchises, I believe that we have tended to be overly reliant on certain gameplay styles or genres,&quot; he said. &quot;Meanwhile, the tastes of customers in the gaming market have diversified, and customers have come to enjoy content from a variety of genres.&quot;

                              <span>Pablo Schreiber, the face (quite literally) behind Master Chief&#x27;s helmet in Paramount&#x27;s Halo adaptation, thinks it was a &quot;huge mistake&quot; to introduce a romantic relationship for the Spartan warrior. In fact, he pushed back against it. 


As a reminder, in the first season of Halo, Schreiber&#x27;s John-117 has sex with human-turned-Covenant agent Makee, as Cortana watches on. They were Cortana in the act, if you will. 


While the intercorse itself wasn&#x27;t actually shown, with the two lovers merely seen touching scars and so on before waking up in bed together, it is very heavily implied. Many felt this was a mistake for the series, along with Master Chief showing both his face and his naked derriere.

                              <span>Tekken 8 will be making some changes to its accessibility features after players and specialists raised concerns when playing the demo.
Last month, players using the game&#x27;s colour blind options reported falling ill with vertigo and migraines, and many people spoke about the need for changes on social media.
Tekken 8 director Katushiro Harada responded and said people had &quot;misunderstood&quot; the accessibility options, which developer Bandai Namco had &quot;never claimed or publicised&quot; would be useful to all colour blind players.

Eight percent of respondees to GDC&#x27;s newly-published 2024 State of the Game Industry report say they are developing their current project for Nintendo Switch 2. Out of 3000 people polled, that accounts for 240 responses.
