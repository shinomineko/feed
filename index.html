                              <span>Square Enix has cancelled development of its long-in-the-works Just Cause mobile game, which had been available in regional early access - but never fully launched - since November 2021.


Just Cause: Mobile was unveiled in December 2020, during The Game Awards, where it was billed as a free-to-play action shooter set in the Just Cause universe, featuring single-player, four-player co-op, and 30-person competitive multiplayer modes.


It was originally set to launch in 2021, and, did, eventually get a release in Singapore - albeit only as regional early access title - before the year was through. Since then, Just Cause: Mobile&#x27;s early access has spread to a number of other countries but development has been repeatedly hit by delays, culminating in an indefinite delay toward the end of last year and, in February, the termination of all regional early access programmes.

                              <span>Last week, a Steam developer suggested Valve was banning games featuring AI-generated content on its platform, after reporting that their game had been rejected for using &quot;fairly obviously AI-generated&quot; assets. 


The developer was given a second chance to resubmit their game but said, via Reddit, that this was also rejected - due to them not owning the necessary rights. 


Now, in a statement provided to Eurogamer, Valve has clarified a few points on this post, and provided further insight into how it will police AI-generated content on Steam in general.

                              <span>Word of a re-release for Rockstar&#x27;s original Red Dead Redemption is doing the rounds, ahead of a potential reveal in the not-too-distant future. 


A fresh rating for Red Dead Redemption via the leaky Korean Ratings Board popped up last week, setting tongues wagging that Rockstar had quietly submitted a fresh version of its cowboy classic to be approved for release.


Details of that listing pointed to a new console version of the game (thanks, Gematsu), rather than anything only for PC.

                              <span>New information on The Last of Us Part 3 reportedly leaked over the weekend, from two internet tipsters better known for their scoops on Marvel TV shows and movies.


While Naughty Dog itself is keeping its plans for the series close to its chest, leaker DanielRPK revealed that Part 3 will introduce five new characters - Lucas, Mason, Val, Ezra and Gracie. 


These five are reportedly part of a group of &quot;scavengers&quot;, who are said to be &quot;surviving on the outskirts of a post apocalyptic city&quot;, and using a Victorian house as their base.

Along with the announcement, there&#x27;s a new teaser starring Psyduck and Lampent, as well as new character Haru working as - you guessed it - the concierge at a Pokémon resort.

                              <span>Far Cry&#x27;s source code has popped up online.

Entitled &quot;Far Cry 1.34 Complete&quot;, the game&#x27;s entire source code was uploaded to the internet archive site Archive.org at the end of June by a user called Llaetha.ro, and has since been shared across Reddit and social media.

It&#x27;s unclear if the code includes any subsequent patches – although the .34 part of the 1.34 title certainly suggests so – and some commenters who&#x27;ve presumably downloaded and run the code believe the code is &quot;not complete, but close&quot;.

While security cameras are commonplace in American cities, self-driving cars represent a new level of access for law enforcement ­ and a new method for encroachment on privacy, advocates say. Crisscrossing the city on their routes, self-driving cars capture a wider swath of footage. And it’s easier for law enforcement to turn to one company with a large repository of videos and a dedicated response team than to reach out to all the businesses in a neighborhood with security systems...</span>

                              <span>Publisher Top Hat Studios has banded with a team of indie developers to bring &quot;underrepresented and grassroots indie&quot; games to consoles and &quot;reach wider audiences&quot;.

The first &quot;indie pack&quot; initiative is out now and hopes to &quot;highlight a variety of genres and aesthetics&quot;. All games included will be coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox One/Series X. 

Whilst called a &quot;pack&quot;, the games aren&#x27;t available as a bundle, but rather as part of an initiative to &quot;semi-regularly spotlight small groups of indie developers&#x27; titles for the first time ever on console&quot;, and &quot;bring more attention to these developers&#x27; titles as well as hope to create a meaningful community experience&quot;.

                              <span>Disney Speedstorm - the hero-based combat racing game inspired by Disney and Pixar worlds - will complete its early access testing period and release in full on 28th September.

The racer will be coming to PC and consoles as a free-to-play title to &quot;allow for more players to share in a fully robust competitive and co-op racing experience&quot;.

&quot;Since the launch of Early Access, we&#x27;ve received invaluable feedback and support from our incredible community of players, who have been instrumental to the improvements made during Early Access,&quot; developer Gameloft said via a statement on the studio&#x27;s social media channels.

                              <span>Valve has banned around 40 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) traders linked to gambling sites, essentially wiping out over £1.5m ($2m) worth of in-game trade items. 

As spotted by Dexerto (via PC Gamer), the bans come after gambling site CSGOEmpire published a spreadsheet of CS:GO traders it believed were part of a cryptocurrency money laundering scheme allegedly operating through a rival gambling site called CSGORoll. 

Whilst Valve has yet to comment on whether or not the bans were connected to the details revealed in the spreadsheet, it seems as though all but one of the accounts leaked on the spreadsheet have now been banned.

Called Genesis, the series – which is one of the franchise&#x27;s first 2D animations to go beyond the backstories of individual characters – will explore events before the Omnic Crisis uprising which saw a series of lethal, hostile robots attack humankind.

Blizzard&#x27;s holding its cards close to its chest, but the teaser above gives us a peek at some familiar faces, including Ana, Reinhardt, and Reaper.

Right now the details are scarce, but Techland popped up on Twitter to inform fans that it was &quot;joining forces&quot; with Skybound&#x27;s The Walking Dead for a new event in which you&#x27;ll get to &quot;survive, scavenge, and slay the undead like never before&quot;.

&quot;We know a thing or two about fighting the undead,&quot; the official Twitter account for The Walking Dead responded, although neither account told us what the event will entail, nor when we can expect to play it – we&#x27;ve just been asked to &quot;stay tuned for more info&quot;.

                              <span>The last of Diablo 4&#x27;s super-rare elusive items have finally been discovered in the wild.

Last week, Diablo 4&#x27;s lead class designer, Adam Jackson, jumped online to &quot;clear up&quot; the confusion around some of Diable 4&#x27;s rarest unique items, and it&#x27;s from Jackson that we learned the names of the six rarest ones: Andariel&#x27;s Visage, Doombringer, Harlequin Crest, Melted Heart of Selig, Ring of Starless Skies, and The Grandfather.

Up until that point, some extraordinarily lucky players had discovered five of the six items, but the most elusive one, Melted Heart of Selig, was still the stuff of legend… until yesterday, it seems, when the item finally dropped for a Chinese necromancer.

Made up of three distinct areas – a couch co-op space called The Cave, streaming room The Stage, and &quot;an entire floor decked out with hands-on stations for those who want to game without distractions&quot; called The Playground – Virgin says the area will be &quot;filled with state-on-the-art equipment and technology&quot; in partnership with our friends at Digital Foundry. 

Open now and set to remain open seven days a week (12pm-8pm Monday-Saturday; 11pm-7pm on Sunday), Virgin says the project has been designed to &quot;remove all barriers around gaming&quot; and is &quot;free of charge for everyone to experience&quot; for &quot;at least 20 minutes at a time&quot;.

Described as a &quot;game about culture, relationships, family pressures, and expressing oneself&quot;, Thirsty Suitors sees you help Jala &quot;handle her demanding parents, reconcile with her exes, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister’s wedding&quot;.

&quot;Can Jala learn to love herself and heal the wounds of her past?&quot; the video description teases, before giving us a two-minute peek at Jala&#x27;s hectic world and family life, reminding some in the comments of Edgar Wright&#x27;s film adaptation of Scott Pilgrim vs The World.

                              <span>With the second instalment of Toby Fox&#x27;s reportedly seven-part &quot;nonviolent&quot; RPG Deltarune steadily approaching its second anniversary, fans are understandably eager to hear when more will be on the way, and while Fox mightn&#x27;t be ready to divulge that particularly bit of information yet, he has now offered a development update.


Deltarune - which charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World - launched its first chapter toward the end of 2018 as a free download. A second instalment - also free - arrived in September 2021, followed by the news a third, fourth and fifth chapter will all launch simultaneously at a later date.


The big question for Deltarune fans, though, is when, and the answer, if Fox&#x27;s latest progress report is anything to go by, still sounds very much like &#x27;not any time soon&#x27;. Fox does reveal, however, the team is currently working on Chapter 3&#x27;s last overworld area - and once that&#x27;s done, &quot;the chapter will finally be playable all the way through&quot;.

News that Ubisoft has finally decided to give everyone what they more or less wanted in the first place comes via Kotaku, which claims, citing two sources familiar with the publisher&#x27;s plans, that the remake is &quot;still in its earliest stages&quot;.


Ubisoft Singapore - the same studio still trying to finish the embattled Skull and Bones - is &quot;heavily involved&quot; with the project, which isn&#x27;t expected to complete &quot;for at least a few years&quot;.

                              <span>Daedalic Entertainment, the company behind this year&#x27;s critically lambasted The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, is reportedly set to exit game development and has laid off around 25 employees as part of the move. Additionally, a second Lord of the Rings game in development at the studio is said to have been cancelled.


Daedalic&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was announced in 2019 for release in 2021, finally arrived last month, following numerous setbacks and delays. Its reception was less-than-positive, however, with Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan calling it a &quot;well-intentioned mess&quot; in his 1 out of 5 review. It was something of a surprise, then, when reports surfaced soon after that Daedalic was currently working on a second Lord of the Rings game.


According to German website Games Wirtschaft, however, that game - which has reportedly been in the works since mid-2022 - is no more, with development now cancelled as part of Daedalic&#x27;s sudden decision to shift away from development and solely into publishing following Gollum&#x27;s poor reception.

                              <span>Hugely popular game platform Roblox was blocked from launching on PlayStation consoles due to concerns by Sony, it&#x27;s been revealed. 


Specifically, Sony was worried about the game&#x27;s popularity among children causing problems for PlayStation.


The details come from a 2022 document uncovered as part of the FTC vs Microsoft trial, spotted by Axios, in which PlayStation boss Jim Ryan discusses Roblox&#x27;s absence from Sony consoles - and admits his company&#x27;s stance from the game is now shifting.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s lawyer made a bit of a slip last night, casually stating that &quot;The Elder Scrolls 16&quot; will release in 2026. Needless to say, this is incorrect.


The court case between Microsoft and the FTC came to a close yesterday, after several days of testimonies, revelations and Sharpie-related blunders. 


During the proceedings, Microsoft&#x27;s lawyer took to the floor in a bid to clear up a bit of a misunderstanding surrounding Bethesda&#x27;s Elder Scrolls series. However, in doing so, they perhaps made things a touch more confusing.

                              <span>Larian Studios has once again addressed the Xbox version of its upcoming RPG Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, confirming that while it&#x27;s still in the work, the developer may ultimately be forced to make &quot;compromises&quot; in order to release on the platform.


Larian&#x27;s struggles with Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 on Xbox first surfaced in February, when - amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive - the studio confirmed it was working on an Xbox version but that it had &quot;run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op.&quot;


In a statement provided to Digital Foundry shortly after, Larian explained its decision not to formally announced an Xbox release was more specifically down to issues it was having getting &quot;split-screen co-op to work to the same standard on both Xbox Series X and S&quot;. And now, in an interview with IGN, studio founder and creative director Swen Vincke has shared more.

                              <span>When we were first introduced to Pioneers of Pagonia, a new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich, earlier this year, there wasn&#x27;t much to go on beyond a brief description and a teaser video. Now, though, with its early access release steadily drawing nearer, we&#x27;ve been given a first proper look at the thing via a new in-game trailer.


Pioneers of Pagonia, to get the fundamentals out the way, sets players loose on the titular (and procedurally generated) islands of Pagonia with the goal of establishing a presence through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover - and the alliances they forge with Pagonia&#x27;s not always friendly inhabitants - along the way.


40 different building types have also been promised for Pioneers of Pagonia&#x27;s Steam early access launch, along with more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. A co-op mode is also planned, meaning you&#x27;ll be able to be a ruinous blight on the land (or otherwise, I suppose) with a friend in tow.

RoboCop: Rogue City - which is build around an &quot;original story&quot; set between RoboCop 2 and 3 - looks to land somewhere between a first-person shooter and cybernetically enhanced detective adventure, whisking players to the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit to solve crimes, slay baddies, and perhaps even turn a few wrong &#x27;uns into goo.


&quot;Explore open areas and complete your objectives according to your own sense of justice,&quot; explains Teyon. &quot;Finding evidence, interrogation and maintaining public order are just some of your daily tasks as a police officer. But don&#x27;t take decisions lightly: your choices can determine the fate of citizens and the result of your mission.&quot;

                              <span>Just when it looked like we might be done with the showcases for the summer, here comes another one, this time from the ever-reliable Annapurna Interactive. And it was a typically strong showing for the publisher, offering a fresh look at some already announced titles - including the new one from Sayonara Wild Hearts&#x27; studio Simogo and the fascinating Cocoon - as well as some big reveals. From stunning photographic adventures to an honest-to-goodness new Blade Runner game, there&#x27;s a lot to look forward to in the months and year ahead, and a full round-up of the showcase can be found below.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes

Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo&#x27;s latest is a baroque blend of surreal mystery thriller and puzzle adenture, faintly bringing to mind the studio&#x27;s iOS classic Device 6. It focuses on a woman&#x27;s search for answers, deep in a strange manor house, as players attempt to solve the enigma at its heart. There&#x27;s no release date yet, but we do it&#x27;s coming to Switch and Steam - and while we await further details, there&#x27;s a tantilising new trailer above.

                              <span>While Microsoft argues with the Federal Trade Commission in the US over its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Canada moved to refute the Xbox maker&#x27;s claims that, the FTC excluded, &quot;all but one&quot; regulator around the world is onboard with its deal - noting that Canada is still &#x27;monitoring the transaction&#x27;.


As reported by The Verge, Canada&#x27;s Competition Bureau has written to Judge Corley, who is currently presiding over the FTC&#x27;s Activision Blizzard case in the US, to correct certain &quot;factual inaccuracies&quot; in Microsoft&#x27;s court filings.


Microsoft had told the court that &quot;every single worldwide regulator that has examined the deal other than the FTC has rejected&quot; the theory it would remove Call of Duty from PlayStation should the acquisition go through, and that all regulators agreed &quot;withholding COD from Sony would be unprofitable and is thus not a serious concern.&quot; It also claimed &quot;all but one foreign regulator&quot; (namely the UK&#x27;s CMA) had cleared the transaction.

                              <span>The Washington Post is reporting that the US is spying on the UN Secretary General.
The reports on Guterres appear to contain the secretary general’s personal conversations with aides regarding diplomatic encounters. They indicate that the United States relied on spying powers granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to gather the intercepts.

Lots of details about different conversations in the article, which are based on classified documents leaked on Discord by Jack Teixeira.
There will probably a lot of faux outrage at this, but spying on foreign leaders is a perfectly legitimate use of the NSA’s capabilities and authorities. (If the NSA didn’t spy on the UN Secretary General, we should fire it and replace it with a more competent NSA.) It’s the bulk surveillance of whole populations that should outrage us...</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Go maker Niantic will lay off 230 staff - around a quarter of the company - and has cancelled a major upcoming project developed in conjunction with Marvel. 


The company will close its recently-released NBA All-World game, end development of its upcoming Marvel World of Heroes project, and shut down its Los Angeles development studio. The news was communicated to staff via an email from company founder John Hanke, which has now been made public.


Pokémon Go, which remains lucrative, is safe. Indeed, Hanke calls it the company&#x27;s &quot;top priority&quot; as it slims down and refocuses on the future.

                              <span>Xbox has revealed its Games with Gold titles for July. 


A big draw this month is Darkwood, the nightmarish survival horror game from Acid Wizard Studio, which will be available between 1st July until 31st July.

Darkwood, which originally released on PC in 2017, is a frightening horror experience that combines exploration, combat, scavenging, crafting and survival into an extremely unusual whole. Our Donlan called it &quot;a masterclass in how to undermine the audience in tiny, gnat-bite ways&quot; when he played it back in 2019.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we look back at a week of headlines from Microsoft&#x27;s time in court arguing its case to buy Activision Blizzard with the FTC.

In the video game industry, courtroom drama does not get much bigger than this. Microsoft&#x27;s Phil Spencer and Satya Nadella, Sony&#x27;s Jim Ryan and Activision boss Bobby Kotick have all given evidence as the US weighs up whether to allow Xbox&#x27;s enormous Call of Duty buyout to procede.
The week has brought us some eye-opening opinions from these top industry execs, as well as a treasure trove of emails to pore through - and some badly-redacted documentation. Today, we recap the biggest stories of the week, including who else was on Microsoft&#x27;s studio shopping list, and why Bethesda is upset at Call of Duty not being platform exclusive. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

The subreddit, at the time of writing, has 7.4m subscribers making it one of the largest on the platform.


However, a post from Mojang developer Mikael Hedberg stated that official support will now cease, though it will remain a place of unofficial discussion.

                              <span>Pikmin 4&#x27;s time rewind feature is a big addition to the series, though I admit being apprehensive at first around how it might be deployed. After a week with the game - and you can read some of my early thoughts here - I&#x27;ve come to use it sparingly, but appreciate its existence.


As its name suggests, the feature allows you to skip backwards and undo any sudden calamity. Though in doing so, my initial fear was it risked devaluing the Pikmin series&#x27; usual high stakes.


After all, the frequent likelihood of imminent Pikmin death - their agonising squeals, the sad sight of their soul floating slowly upwards - acts to ensure you approach each situation with care.

                              <span>Among the many, many claims and discoveries flying around in the wake of Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing FTC lawsuit over the attempted purchase of Activision Blizzard, one particular quote stands out: PlayStation boss Jim Ryan&#x27;s accusation that Xbox Game Pass and other subscription-based services are &quot;value destructive&quot; to video games.
Ryan, speaking in pre-recorded video testimony, also claimed other publishers &quot;unanimously do not like Game Pass&quot; for that reason. When pressed by Microsoft&#x27;s lawyer, he added: &quot;I talk to publishers all the time, and this is a very commonly-held view over many years by the publishers.&quot;
Talking to Eurogamer yesterday, Miles Jacobson, studio head of Sports Interactive, the Sega-owned developer of the ever-popular Football Manager series, disagreed with that quite directly.

Meanwhile, the game&#x27;s PlayStation 5 version will launch slightly later - directly up against Starfield on 6th September. 


Discussing this release reshuffle, Larian Studios exec Michael Douse explained that while the PC version was ready to go, the PS5 edition needed slightly more time, and it did not make sense to delay the former just to release at he same time as the latter.

EA has since removed the advert from its website - though not before it was spotted by Sims fans. (You can still see it now thanks to the Wayback Machine.)

The listing, first spotted by fans on Sims Community, described a Head of Monetisation and Marketplace for Maxis&#x27; &quot;newest entry to The Sims franchise (code named Project Rene)&quot;.

That said, it&#x27;s still sticking with horror. Instead, Bloober is now making &quot;mass-market horror&quot;.


What does that mean? Bloober says it will result in a renewed focus on gameplay over atmosphere, owing to its games being described as &quot;walking simulators&quot;.

As part of the ongoing Microsoft vs FTC court case, Sony provided documentation detailing confidential information about its PlayStation business. As is custom, key details in this documentation were redacted. At least, they were meant to be. 


Thanks to the retrospectively poor choice of using a Sharpie marker to redact the key information, it&#x27;s easy to see the contents of these redactions now the document has been scanned.

                              <span>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said he&#x27;d love to get rid of console exclusives.


Nadella took to the witness stand during yesterday&#x27;s court proceedings for the Xbox FTC hearing, and stated he has &quot;no love&quot; for the world of exclusives, reported IGN.


&quot;If it was up to me, I would love to get rid of the entire sort of exclusives on consoles, but that&#x27;s not up to me to define,&quot; said Nadella.

                              <span>Yager, the developer behind the likes of Spec Ops: The Line and Dreadnought, has announced its free-to-play PvPvE extraction shooter The Cycle: Frontier will be shutting down on 27th September, saying the game is not &quot;financially viable&quot;.


The Cycle: Frontier, which arrived on PC last June, sees teams of players - in the role of Prospectors - airdropping onto a hostile alien planet in order to gather resources, fend off predators and competing teams with a steadily expanding arsenal, then whizz back into space at the end with all their hard-earned spoils.


The game has seen three seasons of updates since its launch last summer, but Yager has now announced development is coming to an end, with its most recent patch being its last.

                              <span>As part of Microsoft&#x27;s court battle with US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission, emails between Xbox boss Phil Spencer and PlayStation head Jim Ryan have been revealed, outlining Microsoft&#x27;s initial proposal to Sony - regarding the Activision Blizzard games it would be willing to keep on the PlayStation platform should its $69bn acquisition be approved - and Ryan&#x27;s lengthy counter-proposal.


As confirmed by Phil Spencer last September, Microsoft contacted Sony shortly after the January announcement of its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, providing a signed agreement to Sony guaranteeing Call of Duty would remain on PlayStation - with feature and content parity - for &quot;at least several more years beyond&quot; Sony current contract.


During his FTC deposition this week, Ryan admitted he &quot;wasn&#x27;t particularly&quot; happy with Microsoft&#x27;s original proposal, but &quot;hoped it was an opening salvo&quot; - and we now have a more precise picture of his initial response, thanks to newly revealed emails, as spotted by The Verge&#x27;s Tom Warren. In a reply dated 26th May, Ryan informed Spencer that Microsoft&#x27;s proposal &quot;did not fulfil&quot; the objective of &quot;ensuring Activision Blizzard games are available on PlayStation&quot;, and that the company had &quot;serious concerns&quot; which an enclosed counter-proposal from Sony was intended to address.

As part of the FTC v. Microsoft hearing, Sony supplied a document from PlayStation chief Jim Ryan that includes redacted details on the margins Sony shares with publishers, its Call of Duty revenues, and even the cost of developing some of its games.
It looks like someone redacted the documents with a black Sharpie ­ but when you scan them in, it’s easy to see some of the redactions. Oops.

I don’t particularly care about the redacted information, but it’s there in the article.</span>

The Kubernetes community has been signing their container image-based artifacts
since release v1.24. While the graduation of the corresponding enhancement
from alpha to beta in v1.26 introduced signatures for the binary artifacts,
other projects followed the approach by providing image signatures for their
releases, too. This means that they either create the signatures within their
own CI/CD pipelines, for example by using GitHub actions, or rely on the
Kubernetes image promotion process to automatically sign the images by
proposing pull requests to the k/k8s.io repository. A requirement for
using this process is that the project is part of the kubernetes or
kubernetes-sigs GitHub organization, so that they can utilize the community
infrastructure for pushing images…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft considered launching a bid to buy Final Fantasy maker Square Enix, freshly-uncovered court documents have revealed. 


The idea was floated among Xbox top brass back in 2019 - before Square Enix sold its suite of Western studios, and before Microsoft got entangled in its current attempted $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout. 


Documents showing Microsoft&#x27;s interest in acquiring Square Enix surfaced today, as the company continues to plead its case with the Federal Trade Commission.

The news was shared on the official Twitter account for the game, noting this includes both physical and digital sales.


It&#x27;s a strong start for the game - the first new mainline single player game in the series for seven years - but how does it compare to other releases in the series?

The result? An influx of negative Steam reviews blasting the team for its decision. 


As spotted by PC Gamer, while Skullgirls&#x27; overall Steam rating remains &quot;Very Positive,&quot; its recent review average is now noted as being &quot;Mostly Negative&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to a reliable leak on DealLabs, stating the games will be available from 4th July - 1st August across both PS4 and PS5.


Alan Wake Remastered is particularly noteworthy ahead of the sequel&#x27;s release on 17th October. Perhaps it&#x27;ll come to Xbox Game Pass before then too?

Microsoft&#x27;s court battle with US antitrust agency the FTC continued last night, with testimony from Ryan. During a pre-recorded video regarding Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing bid to purchase Activision Blizzard, the exec shared further insight on the takeover, and the impact it could have on Sony.


When asked directly if he had any issues with Redfall or Starfield being exclusive, Ryan replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t like it but it&#x27;s not anti-competitive&quot; (thanks, IGN)

McDonald has been busy getting the game running at 60fps for some time - a video from 2020 shows the game at 60fps on a PS4 Pro. Digital Foundry tested their own PS5 version with AI upscaling you can watch below.


McDonald&#x27;s new video has the game running natively on a PS5 at 1080p, without upscaling or interpolation. In McDonald&#x27;s words, it&#x27;s &quot;just raw gameplay capture&quot;.

The change went live earlier this week and was praised by players. But, last night, Niantic announced via Twitter that the buff would be removed. 


Adding to the confusion is the fact that the game&#x27;s community leaders - who are regularly fed information by Niantic - were allegedly told the game was working &quot;as intended&quot; with the spawn change applied.

The first is Landstalker, an isometric adventure developed by Climax Entertainment and released in 1993 in which players take the role of treasure hunter Nigel (no, really). Many of the team went on to develop Alundra for the PlayStation, considered something of a spiritual successor to Landstalker.

                              <span>Blizzard has released its latest patch update for Diablo 4, which will make Nightmare dungeons easier to grind.


Experience rewards have been buffed for Nightmare Dungeons - specifically increasing the experience for both killing monsters in these dungeons and completing them - making them well suited for high level players looking to grind.


Helltide chests will also provide &quot;substantially more bonus experience when opened&quot;, and Whispers have similarly had a significant increase in rewarded experience.

                              <span>Sony has detailed the latest batch of games set to leave the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium game catalogue - and there&#x27;s some big names in the list.


Brilliant post-apocatalyptic feline simulator Stray is among those getting the chop - just ahead of publisher Annapurna Interactive&#x27;s upcoming digital showcase event, where we may see an Xbox version of the game.


Live-service game flop Marvel&#x27;s Avengers is also being removed, although the game itself will still be playable if you pay and gets its final update in September.

                              <span>Following the news that development of BioWare&#x27;s free-to-play MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic would be shifting to a third-party studio, BioWare general manager Gary McKay has now confirmed some team members will lose their jobs as a result of the move.


Writing on the BioWare website, McKay explained that &quot;most of the current team will be invited to accompany&quot; Star Wars: The Old Republic as its development switches over to Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot studio Broadsword Online Games - a move EA previously said was necessary so BioWare could focus on its new Mass Effect and Dragon Age titles.


&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; McKay continued, &quot;not every role will make the move. This is the hardest part of this transition, and these decisions were not made lightly.&quot;

                              <span>The Sims 5 - or Project Rene, as EA is currently calling - is still some considerable way from release, but that isn&#x27;t stopping developer Maxis from showing off its early experiments exploring what this &quot;next generation&quot; Sims game could be - and the studio has now shared a little more as part of its latest Sims stream.


When Project Rene was officially unveiled in October last year, EA teased a game built on a foundation of &quot;charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories&quot; that would be designed with real-time collaboration in mind (solo play is still supported) and be simultaneously playable across a range of devices, including mobile and PC.


At the time, footage was limited to some expanded creativity tools inspired by The Sims 3&#x27;s Create a Style options, but Project Rene&#x27;s latest airing in EA&#x27;s new Behind the Sims showcase (which also had a lot to say about horses) has gone into a little more detail about what The Sims 5 might look like if Maxis&#x27; current experiments prove fruitful.

                              <span>Apple has announced a new batch of titles heading to its Apple Arcade subscription service in July, including two particularly notable oldies-but-goodies: Stardew Valley and Slay the Spire, which both arrive in &#x27;+&#x27; form, denoting they were previously available on the iOS App Store.


Stardew Valley+, as if it needs an introduction, is developer Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone&#x27;s wildly popular spin on the farm life sim genre, having now sold over 20m copies since its launch in 2016. Apple Arcade subscribers will have the opportunity to succumb to its endearing blend of agricultural wealth accumulation and pixel wooing from 28th July.


As for Slay the Spire+, it&#x27;s also a bit of a modern classic. Developer Mega Crit Games&#x27; roguelike deck-building dungeon-crawler - which sees players attempting to fend off monsters and scale the titular spire with nothing but a fist of battle-ready cards - is a wonderfully refined, richly rewarding experience, and well worth seeking out.

                              <span>Among Us, the popular sci-fi social deduction game from developer Innersloth, is being turned into an animated series by CBS Studios.


As reported by Variety, the new series - which is being handled by Big Mouth and Star: Trek Lower Decks animation studio Titmouse - looks to be adhering closely to the core murder-and-deduction premise of its video game source material.


The show&#x27;s official longline reads, &quot;Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone. Root out the &#x27;Impostor&#x27; or fall victim to its murderous designs.&quot;

                              <span>Air Twister, the on-rails 3D shooter and Space Harrier spiritual successor from legendary Sega designer Yu Suzuki is heading to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 10th November this year.


Air Twister, which launched for Apple&#x27;s Apple Arcade subscription service last June, sees players battling alien invaders through 12 stages - and across various modes including  Arcade, Turbo, and Boss Rush - to save a planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


The ensuing action is a bit Space Harrier and a bit Panzer Dragoon - at certain points players take to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and Yu Suzuki has previously said Air Twister was inspired by a fantasy shooting game he envisaged in the 80s, before pivoting toward Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

TechCrunch reviewed the leaked data, which included years of victims’ call logs and text messages dating back to 2013.
The database we reviewed contained current records on at least 13,000 compromised devices, though some of the devices shared little to no data with LetMeSpy. (LetMeSpy claims to delete data after two months of account inactivity.)

The database also contained over 13,400 location data points for several thousand victims. Most of the location data points are centered over population hotspots, suggesting the majority of victims are located in the United States, India and Western Africa...</span>

                              <span>Don’t do it:
Recently, the manager of the Harvard Med School morgue was accused of stealing and selling human body parts. Cedric Lodge and his wife Denise were among a half-dozen people arrested for some pretty grotesque crimes. This part is also at least a little bit funny though:
Over a three-year period, Taylor appeared to pay Denise Lodge more than $37,000 for human remains. One payment, for $1,000 included the memo “head number 7.” Another, for $200, read “braiiiiiins.”


It’s so easy to think that you won’t get caught.

VP of PR and communication Michał Platkow-Gilewski made the comment to GamesIndustry.biz while reflecting on the launch of the game.


&quot;I actually believe Cyberpunk on launch was way better than it was received, and even the first reviews were positive,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Scavengers Studio, the developer behind Season, has laid off over half its staff as it seeks to downsize.


Only 16 employees remain, due to Season performing lower than expected commercially.


News of the layoffs surfaced earlier this month, but GamesIndustry.biz has since received the all-staff announcement from CEO Amélie Lamarche in full.

Much of developer Remedy&#x27;s original pitch for the sequel eventually worked its way into Alan Wake&#x27;s American Nightmare, the action-heavy 2012 standalone spinoff which, while not unanimously loved by critics, went on to be one of the cult hits of the old Xbox Live Arcade days.


Remedy has continued to work on ideas for a full sequel ever since, through the period where it released Quantum Break - the Xbox One exclusive that mixed time-bending action and shooting with live-action TV episodes - and then the fellow &quot;Remedy connected universe&quot; entry Control.

                              <span>Ubisoft has detailed the accessibility options included in forthcoming side-scrolling Metroidvania Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.


In particular, the game will include The Eye of the Wanderer, which will allow players to pin screenshots to the map to help with exploration.


&quot;The genre is quite dependent on being able to &#x27;take mental notes&#x27;; remembering and visualising things like blocked paths, or situations that need tools or powers that you don&#x27;t have,&quot; said senior game designer Rémi Boutin.

That&#x27;s according to the series&#x27; executive producer Tomek Baginski, who has discussed the upcoming third season of the show - the last to star Henry Cavill as the protagonist - in an interview with Yahoo News, where the shift to Hemsworth for future seasons was mentioned.

                              <span>It looks like Hitman developer IO Interactive&#x27;s upcoming online fantasy RPG will be an Xbox console exclusive.


Earlier this year, the Hitman developer announced it was working on a &quot;bold&quot; new franchise. Very little else was shared, other than a tease it would feel both familiar and &quot;unlike anything&quot; the studio had done before. No platforms, or even a project name, were announced at this time.


However, evidence submitted in the ongoing FTC vs Microsoft trial suggests this upcoming release - known (for now) as Project Dragon - will seemingly be an Xbox console exclusive.

The email, sent to Xbox exec Tim Stuart, has publicly surfaced now during Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing courtroom battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout. In it, Booty encourages Xbox to make further acquisitions to bolster Game Pass and compete with Sony.


&quot;We (Microsoft) are in a very unique position to be able to go spend Sony out of business,&quot; Booty wrote, in reference to planned spending of spending $2-3bn in 2020 to avoid competitors getting ahead.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s promise it would keep Call of Duty on rival console platforms after buying Activision Blizzard prompted concern within Bethesda at its highest levels, a newly-published email now shows. 


Bethesda marketing exec Pete Hines emailed bosses, including Todd Howard, to highlight the approach Microsoft was taking with Activision in order to court regulatory approval and note that it was &quot;the opposite&quot; of what Bethesda itself had just been &quot;asked (told) to do&quot; with its own games. 


The email, dated 2nd October last year, expresses concern that Bethesda would be publicly questioned on why games like Starfield are Xbox-only following Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition, as opposed to future incarnations of Call of Duty after Microsoft&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

                              <span>As Microsoft&#x27;s court battle with US antitrust agency the FTC rumbles on, more and more juicy snippets of behind-closed-doors business doings are beginning to surface via released internal documents, and today&#x27;s minor revelation comes via the news that Microsoft reportedly gave serious consideration to buying Sega - and other companies including Bungie and IO Interactive - to help it accelerate Xbox Game Pass.


This little bit of what-might-have-been comes via internal Microsoft documents spotted by The Verge, beginning with an email from Xbox boss Phil Spencer to CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, requesting strategy approval to approach Sega Sammy about a potential acquisition of its Sega games division.


Spencer suggested Sega&#x27;s &quot;well-balanced portfolio of games across segments with global geographic appeal&quot; would help Microsoft &quot;accelerate Xbox Game Pass both on and off-console&quot;, and that Sega&#x27;s &quot;beloved IP&quot; would be particularly effective in helping Games Pass reach new audiences in Asia, &quot;where localised content is critical to success&quot;.

                              <span>Just a day after Bethesda said Starfield&#x27;s physical release would not include a disc, a resurfaced post on the company&#x27;s website has further suggested otherwise - for Xbox users at least.


Word that Starfield&#x27;s physical editions would not include a disc first came via a tweet from Bethesda support over the weekend, which, in answer to a customer query, said, &quot;All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs&quot;.


The outcry was immediate, with fans understandably concerned Microsoft was planning to take advantage of Starfield&#x27;s high-profile release in order to plunge its customers into a digital-only future. That now appears to be less of a concern, however, based on details included in a newly resurfaced pre-order bonus breakdown post on Bethesda&#x27;s website - which corrobrates a tweet unearthed over the weekend on the company&#x27;s Twitter account for Spain,

                              <span>Just a day after Bethesda said Starfield&#x27;s physical release would not include a disc, a resurfaced post on the company&#x27;s website has further suggested otherwise - for Xbox users at least.


Word that Starfield&#x27;s physical editions would not include a disc first came via a tweet from Bethesda support over the weekend, which, in answer to a customer query, said, &quot;All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs&quot;.


The outcry was immediate, with fans understandably concerned Microsoft was planning to take advantage of Starfield&#x27;s high-profile release in order to plunge its customers into a digital-only future. That now appears to be less of a concern, however, based on details included in a newly resurfaced pre-order bonus breakdown post on Bethesda&#x27;s website - which corrobrates a tweet unearthed over the weekend on the company&#x27;s Twitter account for Spain,

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a VR fan and desperate for yet another subscription service to sign up to, you&#x27;re in luck! Meta has announced - and launched - Meta Quest+, a new subscription package promising access to &quot;the best titles&quot; on its virtual reality platforms.


Meta Quest+ isn&#x27;t quite the Game Pass or PlayStation Plus Extra-style smorgasbord you might be envisaging, however; instead, it&#x27;ll give subscribers access to two &quot;handpicked VR titles&quot; each month from a selection of Quest&#x27;s &quot;biggest hits, hidden gems, and back-catalog classics&quot;.


Meta Quest+ is available to Quest 2 and Quest Pro users, and costs £7.99/$7.99 USD a month or £59.99/$59.99 annually - a savings of over 37%, Meta notes. Curious sorts can get their first month&#x27;s subscription for £1/$1 as long as they sign up before 31st July.

                              <span>Closing in on four year since its announcement, Microsoft&#x27;s Perfect Dark reboot is still nowhere to be seen, and a new report claims a succession of unfortunate setbacks has lead to &quot;little meaningful progress&quot; on the project since its 2020 unveiling.


When Microsoft revealed its Perfect Dark reboot for Xbox during The Game Awards in December 2020, it confirmed the project was being developed by The Initiative, the Santa Monica-based studio founded by Crystal Dynamics veteran Darrell Gallagher.


Since then, sporadic reports have suggested something of a tumultuous journey for the project; Crystal Dynamics was brought in to assist The Initiative in September 2021, game director Dan Neuburger departed the studio in March last year, and an exodus of over 30 key staff was reported shortly after - causing head of Microsoft Studios Matt Booty to insist the game wasn&#x27;t in trouble during a panel talk in September 2022.

Forza Horizon 5 players will be gifted two cars inspired by the upcoming Barbie film - a classic 1956 Chevrolet Corvette EV Corvette, driven by Margot Robbie&#x27;s Barbie (see image above), and a 2022 GMC Hummer EV Pickup as favoured by Ryan Gosling&#x27;s Ken. 


Both cars can be downloaded from Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s in-game Message Centre. They will then appear in your garage, ready for you to hit the road (or track).

That&#x27;s according to KFTV, which reports that Minecraft: The Movie will focus on the &quot;malevolent Ender Dragon who sets out on a path of destruction&quot;. 


Thankfully, however, a group of brave and &quot;unlikely&quot; adventurers, headed up by a yet to be named young girl, will &quot;set out to save the Overworld&quot; from the dragon&#x27;s wrath.

                              <span>As we learned in May, from an FAQ provided by developer Remedy, Alan Wake 2 will only have a digital release when it launches on October 17th later this year, with &quot;no plans&quot; for a physical release on disc at the time.
This has naturally sparked some concern among certain fans, with digital-only downloads posing issues for both game preservation, as shown by the closure of the Nintendo 3DS eShop in March this year, as well as ownership rights, exemplified by the infamously de-listed survival horror spinoff PT.
Speaking to Eurogamer at Summer Games Fest earlier this month, Alan Wake 2&#x27;s creative director Sam Lake and game director Kyle Rowley gave us a little more detail on the reasoning behind going digital-only, explaining that, actually, it was to allow Remedy more time to polish the game to an acceptable level - something publisher Epic Games had also been on board with.

However, along with this release, changes have been made to the games&#x27; credits, with several former Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio staff members and entire support studios not being acknowledged for their work on the series.


As spotted by Timo653 over on Reddit, developers such as series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and producer Daisuke Sato - who both left Sega several years ago to form Nagoshi Studio, a subsidiary of NetEase Games - are no longer credited for their work on the games. 


Meanwhile, the entirety of Lab42 (which worked on 0 and Kiwami 1, helping to bring these games to PC) and QLOC (which worked on Kiwami 2 to 6) have also seen their credits removed.

The tweet has since been deleted, but is currently still available via Wayback Machine. A screenshot has also been provided below.

                              <span>Blizzard is currently experiencing a &quot;DDoS attack&quot;, preventing players from logging into Diablo 4 and other games such as World of Warcraft.

In a message posted to the Blizzard customer services account, the company said it was &quot;currently investigating an issue affecting our authentication servers, which may result in failed or slow login attempts&quot; and preventing players from getting online.

According to screenshots posted to the Diablo 4 subreddit, players are also receiving notifications on Battle.net, which state that &quot;we are currently experiencing a DDoS attack, which may result in high latency and disconnections for some players. We are actively working to mitigate this issue&quot;.

Adam Jackson, Diablo 4&#x27;s lead class designer, revealed that the six rarest unique items – Andariel’s Visage, Doombringer, Harlequin Crest, Melted Heart of Selig, Ring of Starless Skies, and The Grandfather – can drop &quot;anywhere you can get a regular unique&quot;, but confirmed that they are &quot;realllly rare&quot; and there are currently only &quot;six of them in the game&quot;.

&quot;Hello! I wanted to clear up some details on the rarest Unique items in Diablo 4,&quot; Jackson tweeted. &quot;1. They can drop from level 85+ enemies 2. You get them anywhere you can get a regular Unique, and they always drop at 820 ipower 3. We currently have 6 of them in the game 4. They&#x27;re realllly rare!&quot;

                              <span>The latest Sons of the Forest patch introduces drivable golf carts, decorative animal heads, and a new boss battle and end-game cutscene.

Along with the usual list of quality-of-life and bug fixes, Endnight Games&#x27; latest patch, Patch 07, continues to build on the survival horror&#x27;s impressive launch by introducing several new features, as well as improving the hitherto stark environs to the east side of the map. Oh, and there are new dedicated servers, too. 

&quot;This patch adds a new boss battle along with a new cutscene to the end of the game, as well as drivable golf carts, a rifle which can be found in one of the caves, frogs that sit on lily pads and chirp, the ability to chop heads off dead animals and use them as wall decorations, a bunch of stone building improvements and lots more,&quot; the development team explains.

                              <span>One of horror&#x27;s most iconic figures is making a comeback: Slender Man.

Whilst, as yet, developer Blue Isle Studios is keeping tight-lipped on what&#x27;s next for the supernatural being, the team recently dropped a tweet teasing a return for the creepypasta mascot a full decade after Slender: The Arrival.

Born by way of an internet urban legend in 2009, Slender Man has popped up in many fan-made and indie horror games, but his most notable in-game appearances include Slender: The Eight Pages in 2012 and 2013&#x27;s Slender: The Arrival before a highly-publicised stabbing incident and moral panic saw the fictional entity go dark for several years.

In a statement, the studio defined what it believed datamining to be – the practice of &quot;extracting information from massive datasets&quot; and &quot;illegal infiltration of in-game code and databases in order to extract information that is intentionally hidden from users&quot; – and said that &quot;in-game accounts involved in datamining and/or sharing data originating from datamining&quot; will be banned, and &quot;further actions taken afterwards&quot;.

&quot;Throughout the past few years, there was an increase of datamined information circling around various websites as well as accounts on social media,&quot; the team explains. &quot;While some players believe that the developers of Escape from Tarkov are not sharing information about hidden changes of the game, we also would like to remind that any data retrieval without official permission is a direct breach of [...] the license agreement.&quot;

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls 6 is unlikely to release for at least &quot;five-plus&quot; years.

That&#x27;s according to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who recently confirmed that the latest instalment of the highly-anticipated RPG series was still &quot;five-plus years away&quot;.

As reported by Axios&#x27; Stephen Totilo – who had been live-tweeting the outcomes from day two of the US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)/Microsoft court case all yesterday – Spencer was &quot;asked a lot&quot; about how Microsoft decides platform exclusivity, with much of the questioning framed around Bethesda&#x27;s parent company, ZeniMax.

Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s stress test – a finite testing period designed to &quot;deliberately stress [NetherRealm&#x27;s] online infrastructure and identify potential issues&quot; ahead of its launch later this year – is currently underway.
 As the test is private and open only to pre-selected players, scalpers are trying their luck and flogging their codes, even though the test is free and only running this weekend, closing at 4pm BST/8am PDT on Monday, 26th June.

Oklahoma will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 13th explorable state when it makes its eventual debut - it joins California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas - and promises a tour of &quot;wonderful state parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends.&quot;


You can get a brief taste of the expansion&#x27;s highways, byways, and sweeping vistas in SCS Software&#x27;s newly released Oklahoma gameplay preview trailer below - which, as ever, is basically video game ASMR, so dim the lights, grab a pillow, and let your cares drift away amid the gentle murmur of digital wheels on digital tarmac.

The initiative - which Google is reportedly branding Playables - will enable users to instantly play online games via YouTube&#x27;s website or via its mobile apps on iOS and Android.


Citing an email sent to Google employees, The Wall Street Journal says the project is currently being testing internally, and that staff are now being invited to participate in the process.

                              <span>With Konami&#x27;s Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 officially announced but still readying for its launch this October, it might seem premature to be discussing Vol. 2 - but here we are with apparent word of at least some of what it&#x27;ll contain, including Metal Gear Solid 4.


It all started after Twitter user Nitroid began poking around the Metal Gear portal website and noticed a spot of oddness with Konami&#x27;s updated Metal Gear timeline.


The gist of the discovery is that Konami&#x27;s revised graphic featured a number of inactive buttons for old games pointing to new pages, leading to speculation that these particular titles - Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and Metal Gear Solid 5 - were being primed for a re-release as part of a Master Collection Vol. 2.

                              <span>As part of a special Sonic the Hedgehog birthday showcase, Sega has revealed a new Lego Dr. Eggman set arriving alongside four previously announced sets on 1st August this year.


Lego formally unveiled its second wave of Sonic the Hedgehog sets back in April, confirming an August arrival for Amy&#x27;s Animal Rescue Island, Sonic&#x27;s Speed Sphere Challenge, Sonic&#x27;s Green Hill Zone Loop Challenge, plus Tails&#x27; Workshop and Tornado Plane.


However, the promotional video released alongside the April announcement teased a fifth Dr. Eggman themed set, and now, two months on, all has been revealed.

                              <span>Famed writer Stephen King granted Remedy the rights to use his infamous quote that opens the original Alan Wake for the nominal sum of just $1.


Alan Wake memorably begins with a voiceover from the game&#x27;s main character quoting King in a description of what nightmares really mean.


Speaking to Eurogamer, Remedy boss Sam Lake revealed he had &quot;really, really, desperately wanted&quot; to be able to open the game with a quote from King himself - whose style matches much of the spooky supernatural horror that follows.

                              <span>It&#x27;s time to pop on party hats and toot appreciatively at Sonic the Hedgehog to celebrate his latest birthday - and Sega is doing something similar in its own way with the release of a free content update for Sonic Frontiers, introducing a New Game Plus mode and more.


A special birthday update for Sonic Frontiers has been on the cards for some time now, having been announced as part of an expansive post-launch support roadmap at the end of last year. Now, however, with Sonic&#x27;s big day finally here, we&#x27;ve got a clearer idea of what it&#x27;ll bring.


For starters, the ordinarily rather drab world of Sonic Frontiers gets a splash of birthday cheer, festooned with the likes of balloons, wrapping paper, and other decor. Additionally, there&#x27;s a jaunty party hat outfit for Sonic so everyone can properly get in the mood.

Reddick, who played Sylens in both this game and its predecessor, passed away earlier this year aged 60. 



In the latest update for the game, players have now discovered a fresh memorial situated on an island visited in the game&#x27;s DLC Burning Shores. It&#x27;s an official homage to the late actor, added by developer Guerilla.

Ciri and Yennefer both appear in their Witcher 3 game guises, with Ciri able to wield the Zireael Sword as a pickaxe that causes her hands to glow.

Blizzard previously detailed its plans for seasonal content (which begins next month) in a blog post but failed to mention the need for a new character. 


However, Diablo franchise general manager Rod Fergusson has now confirmed the requirement, while responding to a fan via Twitter.

                              <span>Bungie has at last served up some backstory for The Traveller, Destiny&#x27;s long-running space moon/golfball thing which has been floating above Earth for much of the past decade. 


Destiny 1, which launched almost nine years ago, introduced The Traveller as a mysterious dormant entity that previously held magical powers, as well as the ability to hold back the ominous-sounding Darkness. 


Where had it come from? What were the nature of its powers? Was the Traveller actually a bad guy? I remember wondering all of these things as I looked up at the orb from Destiny&#x27;s first Tower hub.

Rumours that McConaughey, along with Mahershala Ali, were both in talks for the part were discussed by Josh Horowitz on his Happy Sad Confused podcast (thanks IGN). Here, The Last of Us&#x27; TV showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed he had spoken with McConaughey about playing Joel.


&quot;I actually never talked to Mahershala,&quot; he confirmed. &quot;I did talk to Matthew. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it was serious, it was more of just like, &#x27;Hey, here&#x27;s something we can talk about&#x27;.&quot;

                              <span>Sony was never seriously worried about losing access to Call of Duty if Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, a bombshell email revealed last night has suggested.


The message, sent by PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, was quoted in court by Xbox last night as the US Federal Trade Commission began its hearing into Microsoft&#x27;s attempted $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout.


&quot;It is not an exclusivity play at all,&quot; Ryan wrote in an email to former PlayStation Europe boss Chris Deering. &quot;They&#x27;re thinking bigger than that.

                              <span>Bioware has reassured fans that Star Wars MMO The Old Republic isn&#x27;t heading into maintenance mode, despite the shift to a new developer.



Earlier this month, the developer confirmed the game would be moving to a third-party studio so BioWare can focus its efforts on the forthcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and future Mass Effect game.


Fans have since been concerned about the future of The Old Republic, but a new forum post from executive producer Keith Kanneg lays out the future of the game, and notes BioWare is currently helping with &quot;planning for 2024 and 2025&quot;.

                              <span>UPDATE 10.45pm: In a statement provided to Eurogamer following the Los Angeles City Tourism Department&#x27;s suggestion that E3 shows planned for 2024 and 2025 have been cancelled, the ESA has said it&#x27;s &quot;currently having conversations about E3 2024 (and beyond), and no final decisions about the event have been made at this time.&quot;

ORIGINAL STORY 10.11pm: Following the shock cancellation of this year&#x27;s E3 back in March, new details shared by the Los Angeles City Tourism Department suggest the games industry trade show won&#x27;t be making a comeback anytime soon, with shows scheduled for 2024 and 2025 now also seemingly cancelled.


As spotted by Restera, the Entertainment Software Association, which owns E3, had initially booked the Los Angeles Convention Centre for the weeks beginning 11th June 2024 and 3rd June 2025 - dates shared as part of a Los Angeles City Tourism Department report last October.

                              <span>Why, it&#x27;s horse, of course! As widely expected thanks to a few cheeky leaks earlier this week, The Sims 4 is ushering in a new age of the equine for its next paid expansion; Horse Ranch, as the release is known, arrives on 20th July for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


Horse Ranch&#x27;s primary focus is Chestnut Ridge, a new rustic prairie world inspired by the American West. Here, players can live out an idyllic life - either in a traditional country cabin or in something with a few more mod cons - caring for mini goats, mini sheep, and, of course, horses, which can be rescued, bred, purchased, customised, and raised from foals.


Sims not afraid to get their hands dirty have plenty of options on the ranch, from mucking out horse beds to harvesting prairie grass for the animal feeder, and it&#x27;s even possible to brew moonsh... sorry, Nectar, by smashing up fruit and veg then ageing the results on Nectar racks ready for sale. There&#x27;s also sheep shearing, goat milking, and other animal interactions.

                              <span>Speaking during today&#x27;s FTC hearing, Bethesda&#x27;s Pete Hines has confirmed the company&#x27;s upcoming Indiana Jones game will be exclusive to Xbox and PC, with the court being told a multi-console contract was amended following the company&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft.


Bethesda announced its Indiana Jones game back in January 2021, confirming it was being developed by Wolfenstein studio MachineGames. However, it failed to make mention of the platforms it would target, a notable omission at the time given Microsoft&#x27;s then-impending $7.5bn USD acquisition of Bethesda and Zenimax.


Little has been heard of the game since that initial reveal, but it&#x27;s now burst back into the spotlight in something of an unexpected way - during a witness testimony from Bethesda&#x27;s head of global publishing Pete Hines, as part of US antitrust agency the FTC&#x27;s court proceedings to secure an injunction to block Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn Activision Blizzard deal.

                              <span>Just three years after its much-heralded arrival, Activision is pulling the plug on the original Call of Duty: Warzone. The free-to-play battle royale shooter set to go offline on 21st September.


Call of Duty: Warzone launched along Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2020, but was renamed Warzone Caldera after the arrival of its similarly styled successor, Warzone 2.0, last November.


Warzone Caldera has remained available in the months since then - meaning players have been able to continue using real-money purchases including skins and weapons unavailable in 2.0 - but now Activision has signalled the end is in sight for the original experience, warning that all progression, inventories, and online services will &quot;expire&quot; in September.

The Xbox maker is currently in court to defend its $69bn USD Activision Blizzard acquisition, which the FTC is fighting to block through an injunction ahead of its own internal deliberations.


As part of a (heavily redacted) court filing intended to supplement the five-day case, Microsoft has once again attempted to portray itself the underdog in the console market.

Now we have the full list, including extras. What&#x27;s more, Konami has confirmed Metal Gear Solid 1, 2, and 3 will be available to purchase separately as digtal downloads for £16 each.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss yesterday&#x27;s Mario-packed Nintendo Direct and Microsoft&#x27;s surprise price rises.

For Nintendo, yesterday&#x27;s online extravaganza acted like a shot of adrenaline to Switch&#x27;s aging heart. There had been questions around how much Nintendo might still have for Switch, post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Now we have answers - and a release schedule busier than either Microsoft or Sony&#x27;s for the remainder of 2023. Switch 2 certainly now feels even longer away.
Microsoft, meanwhile, took advantage of the Elephant Mario in the room to announce it&#x27;s long-suspected price rises for Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Series X. It was an oppurtune moment for Microsoft to deliver the bad news, with the value of Game Pass demonstrated last week at its well-receieved Xbox Game Showcase. Still, was it really necessary? Or could it just get away with it because PlayStation blinked first? Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Twitch has launched a new Hype Chat feature to allow viewers pay to have messages pinned at the top of the chat window.


The main aim is to provide a new way for viewer messages to stand out in a busy, fast moving chat, as well as an additional method for streamers to make money.


Messages can be purchased from $1 to $500 (with streamers able to set a minimum up to $100) and the duration, character count, and visual design of the pin will depend on the amount spent. Twitch will take a 30 percent cut of revenue earned.

&quot;&gt;official collaboration with Microsoft to officially bring Excel into sci-fi MMO Eve Online. Excel spreadsheets are a popular way for players to manage the huge amounts of data gained whilst overseeing and expanding their space assets.

At the beginning of this year, CCP Games announced its year-long roadmap for the game, where it stated its aim to launch Excel integration in May for Omega subscribers.

The Excel add-in is now free to use for all players, after launching yesterday. Eve&#x27;s API is used to import player data, meaning no programming knowledge is required.

The Past Within is the latest in a series that has so far spanned 15 loosely interconnected games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banners, with another one - the recently announced Underground Blossom - expected to arrive on PC later this year.


Like its predecessors, The Past Within delivers a deliciously surreal mix of casual point-and-click puzzling and room escape action, albeit this time given a devious co-operative twist.

                              <span>Action roguelike Midautumn is named after the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the most important events of the calendar for many countries in Asia. It&#x27;s a celebration of the full moon, usually falling in September or October, though traditions vary between countries. For me, it&#x27;s a time of year I&#x27;ll always associate with the mooncakes my grandma shares with us. For Midautumn developer Sherveen Uduwana, it brings back memories of attending these festivals as a child, and the comfort of lanterns and fireworks floating in the dark night sky.


Available in demo form during LudoNarraCon last month, Midautumn&#x27;s blend of thematic storytelling and action mechanics immediately caught my eye - as well as its name. Still, Uduwana is aware Midautumn&#x27;s title - and the experiences within Asian diaspora communities that inspired him - won&#x27;t immediately feel familiar to many others. &quot;I think a lot of folks I was pitching it to were like, why is it called Midautumn?&quot; Uduwana tells me, adding that he settled on the name very early on. &quot;There&#x27;s a specific type of person who, when they find out the game is called Midautumn, gets very excited.&quot;


Uduwana tried pitching the game in a traditional way to secure funding, but the culture gap - and then, more significantly, the pandemic and the wave of anti-Asian sentiment surrounding it - caused him to opt for a more indie development approach instead. &quot;That galvanised me to just be like, I&#x27;m just gonna message people and we&#x27;ll try and make it,&quot; he says. &quot;I was tired of having to explain why people would relate to it, or why it would be something that would be exciting for folks. A lot of people in those positions of power are just not really tuned into those specific communities.&quot;

                              <span>Roblox, the hugely-popular game platform used by millions of younger players, has introduced a 17+ age category for experiences aimed at older audiences. 


Current categories exist for All Ages, 9+ and 13+, and Roblox has traditionally been seen as a place popular for children to play. 


But Roblox&#x27;s audience is growing older - a natural step as the game matures in age and retains players as it does so - and 38 percent of Roblox&#x27;s most active users were 17 and older in 2022, Roblox has said, making it the game&#x27;s fastest-growing age group.

                              <span>PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has said that Sony would no longer be able to share details of its upcoming console hardware with Call of Duty maker Activision, if Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn buyout was approved by regulators.


Speaking to the US Federal Trade Commission, which is currently involved in legal proceedings to block the deal, Ryan said Sony &quot;simply could not run the risk of a company that was owned by a direct competitor having access to that information&quot;.


Ryan&#x27;s comments date from April this year, when the FTC questioned the PlayStation CEO on statements submitted by Sony designed to give its perspective on the deal. Chief among those is the worry by Sony that its game development processes would be interrupted as it &quot;could no longer share confidential details about its next console in development&quot;.

Poncle notes it&#x27;ll also be possible to switch seamlessly from single- to co-op play and back between stages, and that achievements will be unlockable when playing with friends.

This Friday more specifically marks 32 years since Sonic&#x27;s western debut on Sega Mega Drive, which technically (if I have my hedgehog lore right) means he&#x27;ll be celebrating his 47th birthday given his age in the first game. So before his back gives out completely, Sega will presumably be keen to shove as many announcement out as possible.


Friday&#x27;s Sonic Central, then, is promising a &quot;sneak peek of some of our upcoming projects, partnerships, and events happening in 2023&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced a price hike for its Xbox Series X console across most of the world, as well as for monthly Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions, with the increases set to come into effect over the next few months.


As reported by The Verge, Xbox Game Pass for Console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be impacted by the changes first. Prices are set to rise for new customers on 6th July, but existing monthly subscribers won&#x27;t see the changes until 13th August (13th September in Germany).


Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will increase from £10.99/€12.99/$14.99 USD a month to £12.99/€14.99/$16.99, while Game Pass for Console rises from £7.99/€9.99/$8.99 a month to £8.99/€10.99/$10.99. Xbox Game Pass for PC will be unaffected.

                              <span>It’s become fashionable to think of artificial intelligence as an inherently dehumanizing technology, a ruthless force of automation that has unleashed legions of virtual skilled laborers in faceless form. But what if AI turns out to be the one tool able to identify what makes your ideas special, recognizing your unique perspective and potential on the issues where it matters most?
You’d be forgiven if you’re distraught about society’s ability to grapple with this new technology. So far, there’s no lack of prognostications about the democratic...</span>

                              <span>Tadayoshi Kohno, Yasemin Acar, and Wulf Loh wrote excellent paper on ethical thinking within the computer security community: “Ethical Frameworks and Computer Security Trolley Problems: Foundations for Conversation“:
Abstract: The computer security research community regularly tackles ethical questions. The field of ethics / moral philosophy has for centuries considered what it means to be “morally good” or at least “morally allowed / acceptable.” Among philosophy’s contributions are (1) frameworks for evaluating the morality of actions—including the well-established consequentialist and deontological frameworks—and (2) scenarios (like trolley problems) featuring moral dilemmas that can facilitate discussion about and intellectual inquiry into different perspectives on moral reasoning and decision-making. In a classic trolley problem, consequentialist and deontological analyses may render different opinions. In this research, we explicitly make and explore connections between moral questions in computer security research and ethics / moral philosophy through the creation and analysis of trolley problem-like computer security-themed moral dilemmas and, in doing so, we seek to contribute to conversations among security researchers about the morality of security research-related decisions. We explicitly do not seek to define what is morally right or wrong, nor do we argue for one framework over another. Indeed, the consequentialist and deontological frameworks that we center, in addition to coming to different conclusions for our scenarios, have significant limitations. Instead, by offering our scenarios and by comparing two different approaches to ethics, we strive to contribute to how the computer security research field considers and converses about ethical questions, especially when there are different perspectives on what is morally right or acceptable. Our vision is for this work to be broadly useful to the computer security community, including to researchers as they embark on (or choose not to embark on), conduct, and write about their research, to program committees as they evaluate submissions, and to educators as they teach about computer security and ethics...</span>

                              <span>After the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo&#x27;s Switch slate was looking a little bare bones for the rest of 2023.


But after today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct we have a much clearer picture of what&#x27;s still to come, with a look at Pikmin 4 headlining the showcase, plus reveals of a Super Mario RPG remake and a brand new 2D Mario game.


First, though, Nintendo showed a fresh look at the forthcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC heading to Switch later this year.

Wave five will arrive this summer, complete with a new course known as Squeaky Clean Sprint. 


From what we can see in the trailer, this course looks to be taking us around a sud-filled bathroom, with plenty of bubbles and bottles to negotiate. It will be joined by another seven courses, which are yet to be announced.

                              <span>As rumoured ahead of today&#x27;s Direct, Nintendo has a new side-scrolling Mario platformer in the works. It&#x27;s called Super Mario Bros. Wonder and it comes to Switch on 20th October.


At first glance, Super Mario Bros. Wonder&#x27;s presentation is all very New Super Mario, with its crisp, clean lines - albeit this time slightly stylised - and familiar Mario motifs. But then, midway through its announcement trailer, Mario encounters a new power-up and things get weird.


Warp pipes come alive in wiggly choreography, heaving and bending all over the place; spherical cows come tumbling in; Mario - and the world around him - gets a new stretchy, silhouetted look, and here come mega-herds of adorable sheep!

                              <span>Nintendo has just announced WarioWare: Move It! for Switch, which is set for launch on 3rd November.


This latest entry in the fast-paced microgame series contains 200 quickfire rounds, controlled via your Joy-Con. 


There&#x27;s co-op play for two players, plus party modes for up to four. A quick trailer shown off in today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct featured a smattering of classic Nintendo titles repurposed as party game experiences, such as being able to skid down Princess Peach&#x27;s slide from Mario 64, and an appearance from Olimar in Pikmin 1.

                              <span>AI is a hot topic of discussion across the video game industry right now. Several developers have flirted with this new technology, with the likes of Ubisoft announcing its Ghostwriter AI tool earlier this year. Meanwhile, the High on Life team used AI to create video game voice dialogue.


Last week, I had the opportunity to chat with voice actors Jennifer Hale and David Hayter about their upcoming release, Synapse, and during this conversation, the topic of AI came up.


&quot;I have been staying on top of it,&quot; Hale assured me when I asked about the actors&#x27; personal take on the matter. &quot;And the number one thing I want to say to everybody out there is: Stay out of fear. Stay in action.&quot;

                              <span>Pikmin 4 not enough Pikmin for you? Well then it&#x27;s your lucky day! Nintendo has announced Pikmin 1 &amp; 2 are coming to Switch, with both titles getting a surprise release on eShop today.


The first Pikmin introduced the world to Captain Olimar and his titular half-plant, half-animal pals back on GameCube in 2001. A sequel followed in 2004, expanding on the original&#x27;s real-time strategy style puzzling with new Pikmin, cave exploration, and more.


Since then, both titles have received gentle updates for Wii, introducing a pointer-style control system. However, it&#x27;s not entirely clear which editions of Pikmin 1 &amp; 2 are coming to Switch, with Nintendo only referring to them as &quot;HD versions&quot;.

                              <span>An upcoming Princess Peach-focused game was announced at today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct. 


Details are still incredibly sparse. The short teaser showed the platform&#x27;s Princess Toadstool making her way along a rather fairytale-looking street set on a theatre stage. Then she made a tree burst into bloom to open a door, all thanks to a nifty use of magic. 


She then magically changed from her standard pink dress into something a little more dazzling, and the trailer ends.

A sequel to Detective Pikachu&#x27;s original 2019 3DS adventure was announced that same year, but The Pokémon Company has shared little about the project in the years since.


Now, though, Detective Pikachu has resurfaced during Nintendo&#x27;s latest Direct showcase. It&#x27;ll once again see the titular sleuthing fuzzball team up with human pal Tim Goodman for some crime-fighting adventure, but beyond that details are limited.

Earlier this month, the FTC succeeded in getting a temporary ban placed on Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout bid. Now, ahead of an upcoming hearing regarding the agency&#x27;s request for a preliminary injunction, the FTC has submitted further documentation on the matter.


In a new and heavily redacted filing, the FTC has refered back to Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of ZeniMax and Bethesda. The company stated Microsoft&#x27;s decision to make ZeniMax games exclusive is &quot;powerful evidence of incentive to foreclosure&quot;.

Tags are applied by streamers to label their own content, with these new labels replacing the existing Mature Content toggle to be more specific.


This change comes as part of Twitch&#x27;s commitment to community safety.

                              <span>If you have no particularly strong feelings about horses in The Sims 4, join the club. However, plenty of fans have been positively clamouring for their heavily rumoured arrival - and it looks like EA has finally relented, teasing they&#x27;ll be coming very soon.


The Sims 4 developer Maxis has been on something of a fan-pleasing crusade of late; last year marked the long-awaited return of werewolves, for instance, alongside more robust options for Sims teens, while 2023 has bought babies back in a big way.


Now, though, it looks like it&#x27;s finally time for much-requested horses to shine; EA has announced its latest The Sims 4 development roadmap, promising two &quot;bold kits&quot; for release between June and September, as well as a &quot;rootin&#x27; tootin&#x27; expansion&quot;.

Writing on EA&#x27;s website, CEO Andrew Wilson said the restructuring would &quot;empower our studio leaders with more creative ownership and financial accountability to make faster and more insightful decisions around development and go to market strategies&quot;.


&quot;These steps will accelerate our business, drive growth, and deliver long-term value for our people, our players and our communities,&quot; Wilson added.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced its indie-focused ID@Xbox Showcase will return this July, coinciding with the launch of its annual Summer Game Fest demo event.


This latest instalment of ID@Xbox takes place on 11th July and is set to feature a &quot;first look at some new games including trailers, gameplay, reveals and more&quot;. It&#x27;ll be hosted via IGN and, if past instalments are any indication, expect it to be a decidedly languid affair.


July&#x27;s ID@Xbox showcase arrives alongside Microsoft&#x27;s returning Summer Game Fest demo event. This runs from 11th-17th July and provides access to a selection demos for upcoming indie titles on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, available to download and play at home.

Immortals of Aveum, a first-person fantasy shooter that trades bullets for magic spells, follows the adventures of Jak as he joins an elite order of battlemages in a bid to save the world. It&#x27;s the work of developer Ascendant Studios and is being published under the EA Originals label. 


While Immortals of Aveum was initially expected to launch in July, Ascendant Studios has now announced a one-month delay in a statement shared on its website.

                              <span>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has admitted the financial underperformance of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope was likely down to the publisher&#x27;s decision to ignore Nintendo&#x27;s advice to &quot;only do one iteration [of Mario] on each machine&quot;.


Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope received an extremely positive critical reception when it launched last October, with many praising the smart refinements it bought its predecessor&#x27;s already wonderfully engaging strategic core.


Its commercial reception was far more muted, however; in an emergency investor call held at the start of the year to share news of its considerably lower-than- expected earnings, Ubisoft admitted it had been &quot;surprised&quot; by Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope&#x27;s &quot;underperformance in the final weeks of 2022 and early January&quot;.

                              <span>An anonymous leaker has dropped a huge amount of data on Genshin Impact&#x27;s upcoming region, Fontaine, called out developer HoYoverse&#x27;s &quot;ridiculously pointless&quot; security measures, going so far as to suggest solutions which could make it harder for leakers in future. 
A message from this person simulataneously calls out other Genshin leakers for taking part in &quot;clout hierarchy&quot; and general drama.
Files made available in this leak mostly contain concept artwork on new characters, weapons, and environments for Fontaine, the upcoming new underwater region expected to debut in Genshin Impact&#x27;s big 4.0 patch.

Released at the end of last year, Unbound is the latest in the racing series that was somewhat ill-fated. It will join Game Pass (cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S) on 22nd June.


On the same day, The Bookwalker will be available day one (console, PC) - an indie narrative adventure about a writer-turned-thief who can dive directly into books.

Dott&#x27;s YouTube channel has plenty of videos in the style, including a re-imagining of Pokémon Red.



But SNES RPG Chrono Trigger - one of Square Enix&#x27;s greatest achievements - is perhaps the most obvious candidate for an actual remake in this style.

                              <span>Square Enix has quietly updated its Final Fantasy racer Chocobo GP on Switch as a complete package.


Back in December, the company announced an end to &quot;large scale updates&quot; for the game nine months after its release. This included the removal of its in-game mythril shop (in January) used for microtransactions.



The game has an updated release date in the eShop (31st May 2023 in the UK store), seemingly related to the Chocobo GP Lite version of the game that no longer exists.

                              <span>Developer Larian Studios has launched an ARG website called Blood in Baldur&#x27;s Gate, set 15 years before the events of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.

Blood in Baldur&#x27;s Gate is a murder mystery which sets players the task of finding out who has killed an elf. The game takes place on a map of the lower part of Baldur&#x27;s Gate, where players can select locations to visit and investigate.

Each day, players can vote on where to head next and whichever location gets the most votes will be made available. The game updates every weekday, and Larian has stated the game will run for the next three weeks.

                              <span>Halo Infinite will no longer include seasonal narrative cutscenes from Season 4 onwards.

Brian Jarrard, community director at 343 Industries made the statement on Twitter yesterday, describing the cuts as a trade-off.

&quot;As we&#x27;ve redefined our top priorities and shifted resources internally this year,&quot; Jarrard wrote, &quot;we had to make the decision to forego seasonal narrative cutscenes to make room for the team to continue focusing on highly requested features, content, and improvements for Halo Infinite.&quot;

                              <span>Official artwork for Pikmin 4 has detailed several unannounced features for Nintendo&#x27;s long-awaited upcoming garden strategy sequel.


This includes the game&#x27;s split-screen multiplayer mode - a long-standing feature of the series since Pikmin 2 - and what looks like the ability for a second player to aid you in the game&#x27;s main campaign via some kind of targeting reticule.


Environments shown off here appear to include the interior of a house - a dramatic departure for the series which has so far stayed outside (or underground). And yes, spoilers for Pikmin 1, the series is indeed set on Earth.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest host Geoff Keighley has commented on the lack of women on stage during this year&#x27;s show - and said one woman had been due to appear.


Discussing the show with CBC, Keighley acknowledged the all-male line-up on stage had been &quot;a fair flag&quot; for criticism, even if this had not originally been the intent. 


This is Us actress Melanie Liburd, who stars in Alan Wake 2 as its new co-protagonist, had been due to appear at one point, Keighley said.

The two game collection was first announced at the February Nintendo Direct this year as a summer release; now we know it&#x27;ll launch on 15th September.


To modernise the games and make them more approachable, new options will include: no encounters, auto-battle, skip cutscenes, and auto-save options.

                              <span>Steam Next Fest, Valve&#x27;s semi-regular celebration of gaming things to come, is back for another week of developer chats, livestreams, and an intimidating stack of &quot;hundreds&quot; of demos likely to thwart even the most committed completionist.


Proceedings are now firmly underway, continuing until next Monday 26th June, and Valve has provided a full list of available demos and livestreams for those eager to dive right in. But should decision paralysis strike, you&#x27;ll find a few potentially promising places to start - based on some of the games Eurogamer has been harbouring mounting excitement for in recent times - below.


The list is far from exhaustive, of course, and all the games I&#x27;ve included are largely known quantities - it&#x27;ll take a lot more poking around Valve&#x27;s subterranean depths before Steam Next Fest&#x27;s latest batch of hidden gems reveals itself. But in the meantime, while the poking continues, perhaps the following will provide some initial inspiration - and if anything catches your eye as you do your own deeper delving, feel free to share in the comments.

                              <span>The New York Times has responded to the comparisons between its new game Connections and BBC quiz show Only Connect.

Last week, Connections began beta testing and gained attention from viewers and host of Only Connect for its similarities to the show.  

In a statement sent to Eurogamer on the close similarity between the two, The New York Times said &quot;the content of Connections is unique, handcrafted and has a distinctive style synonymous with New York Times Games&quot;.

                              <span>A new duplication glitch has been discovered in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom which can fill up your wallet very quickly, depending on how fast you can press the A button.

The glitch is relatively simple and requires a couple of weapons, some raw meat, and at least 57 Zonaite. It should be replicable in versions of the game up to 1.1.2, which is the version I tested it on and can confirm it works.

If you want a video guide to follow, the earliest video I can find of the glitch is from YouTube channel No Hypothesis. YouTuber Austin John Plays has a thorough guide too, in which he notes where things could go wrong.

The developer apologised for this update, stating the team &quot;didn&#x27;t want to do any pre-release or release day updates&quot; for Final Fantasy 16 - even one this minor. 


Here are the full Final Fantasy 16 day one patch notes:

Cavill was speaking at Netflix&#x27;s Global Fan Event, Tudum over the weekend. There, the actor was joined on stage by fellow Witcher stars Freya Allan, Anya Chalotra, and Joey Batey to discuss the show&#x27;s upcoming third season, which will apparently feature &quot;a very shocking death&quot;. Also, those of us who have not read the books are going to be &quot;blown away&quot; by season three&#x27;s &quot;big bad&quot;. 


But, of course, what most people wanted to hear about was Cavill&#x27;s departure from the show, something he announced towards the end of last year.

Named as &quot;Final Fantasy Mode&quot;, this option will sit on the game&#x27;s main menu once you have beaten the main campaign, and allow you to carry over your items, abilities and level progression into a fresh playthrough. 


Here, the level cap will be raised to 100, though you&#x27;ll also have to face &quot;far more powerful&quot; enemies.

Stahelski made the comments in an interview with Comic Book Movie to promote John Wick: Chapter 4&#x27;s release on Blu-ray.


The adaptation of Ghost of Tsushima was announced in 2021 with Stahelski as its director, and Takashi Doscher was named as its writer in 2022. Since then, Stahelski has stated the adaptation will be &quot;a complete Japanese cast, in Japanese&quot; with Sony on-board backing his choice.

The first attack uses an Internet-connected surveillance camera to take a high-speed video of the power LED on a smart card reader­or of an attached peripheral device­during cryptographic operations. This technique allowed the researchers to pull a 256-bit ECDSA key off the same government-approved smart card used in Minerva. The other allowed the researchers to recover the private SIKE key of a Samsung Galaxy S8 phone by training the camera of an iPhone 13 on the power LED of a USB speaker connected to the handset, in a similar way to how Hertzbleed pulled SIKE keys off Intel and AMD CPUs...</span>

                              <span>Some Final Fantasy players have revealed they plan to boycott Final Fantasy 16 due to the development team&#x27;s &quot;continuously questionable response&quot; to the lack of diversity in the game. 

Last November, producer Naoki Yoshida addressed the lack of diversity in an interview, and the response did little to assuage the concerns of Black and minority ethnic players. 

In direct response to this, some players are now planning to &quot;boycott Final Fantasy 16 due to the lack of diversity and minority characters&quot;.

To secure your copy when the game releases on 20th October 2023, you can pre-order one of three editions now: the standard edition, the Digital Deluxe Edition, and the Collector&#x27;s Edition and also earn additional skill points.

The standard edition is exactly what it says on the tin and will set you back £70/$70/€80, whilst the Digital Deluxe Edition boasts the base game with 10 extra suits – five each for Peter and Miles – additional photo mode items, and two additional skill points. That will cost around £80/$80/€90.

                              <span>Blizzard has revealed that the &quot;significant majority&quot; of players have yet to complete Diablo 4. 

That&#x27;s according to Diablo 4&#x27;s game director, Joe Shely, who confirmed on a recent fireside chat that whilst it may feel as though players are rocketing through the story campaign, the truth is that most players are taking their time, albeit &quot;playing through content much more quickly&quot;.

&quot;The significant majority of our players haven&#x27;t finished the game yet,&quot; Shely said in the livestreamed discussion. &quot;But many of the people who are watching this stream, and our dedicated players, play through content much more quickly and have been experiencing this situation with the dungeons.&quot;

                              <span>Halo developer 343 Industries has acknowledged that Halo Infinite &quot;struggled&quot; to provide a &quot;consistent pipeline of new content for players&quot;, saying it needs to &quot;start showing more noteworthy improvements&quot; when it comes to the shooter&#x27;s &quot;technical and experiential quality&quot;.

In an interview with Xbox Wire, head of live Service Sean Baron reflected on the sci-fi shooter&#x27;s first year, and confirmed that &quot;the cadence of content&quot; will continue to be &quot;improved&quot; going forward.

&quot;Season 4 is very exciting for me because it&#x27;ll mark the third straight on-time release for the Halo Infinite Live Service team,” says Baron. &quot;You know the saying: &#x27;Once is chance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is a pattern&#x27;.

                              <span>This is just crazy:
Scientists don’t yet know for sure why octopuses, and other shell-less cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish, are such prolific editors. Researchers are debating whether this form of genetic editing gave cephalopods an evolutionary leg (or tentacle) up or whether the editing is just a sometimes useful accident. Scientists are also probing what consequences the RNA alterations may have under various conditions.

I sometimes think that cephalopods are aliens that crash-landed on this planet eons ago.

                              <span>Viking survival game Valheim now has difficulty options, so you can make the experience a little easier - or more difficult, if you prefer. 


Developer Iron Gate Studio has said it hopes these options will encourage potential players previously put off by Valheim&#x27;s sometimes unforgiving nature to give the game a go. 


As you&#x27;d expect, hard mode buffs enemy HP and damage output. Easy mode, as Iron Gate puts it, caters to those seeking &quot;a lighter, more accomodating adventure ideal for the pacifists and builders&quot;.

From indie developer Brightrock Games, Galacticare is a management game that tasks players with running a hospital in space teeming with alien life - and alien afflictions.


As announced a couple of months back, the game is set for release this year on PC (Steam and GOG), PlayStation 5 and Xbox consoles, plus it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Game Pass.

This means a delay of around a year from Flintlock&#x27;s previously-expected &quot;early 2023&quot; arrival.


Set to release for PC, PlayStation and Xbox, this &quot;magic meets gunpowder technology&quot; fantasy action RPG made an impression when it was shown at the Xbox Games Showcase 2022. (Chalk this up as another title not to make that showcase&#x27;s &#x27;released in the next 12 months&#x27; promise).

Mod team member Isatris has now created a mod that adds Hunter weapons and armour from Bloodborne into the demo of the pinocchio Soulslike (thanks PCGamesN). The integration, visually at least, is a harmonious blend.


It&#x27;s not quite Bloodborne on PC, though, as much as fans might be thirsting for it. The mod only changes outfits so Lies of P gameplay remains intact - don&#x27;t expect any guns!

Speaking to Axios, Xbox Game Studios chief Matt Booty said Arkane would remain open. &quot;That is the plan right now,&quot; he said.


&quot;They are hard at work on updates and continued content for Redfall,&quot; Booty continued, saying he wanted to &quot;support them to be able to keep working to deliver the game they had in mind&quot;.

Partner Plus is a benefit for existing Partners, offering the 70 percent revenue split on subscriptions that many streamers have been requesting for a long time but Twitch itself has denied.



The response from streamers to this news, however, has been mostly negative.

Speaking to The Wrap, Chris Meledandri - who founded Illumination back in 2007 - said he didn&#x27;t know where this Legend of Zelda report came from.

Often simply referred to as Fire Emblem, this was an important entry in Nintendo&#x27;s long-running RPG series - the very first to be released in the West. 


Originally launched in Japan back in April 2003, it finally reached European shores in July 2004, and began the franchise&#x27;s journey to becoming a household name on these shores.

So far, only spoilers from the start of the game have leaked - which you can experience already in the Final Fantasy 16 demo - but if you&#x27;re looking to avoid further details, now is the time to use that mute button liberally.

                              <span>Moving Out, the knockabout co-op removals game from developer SMG Studio, is getting a sequel - complete with the likes of online cross-play multiplayer for the first time - and it&#x27;ll be launching on 15th August for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.


The original Moving Out arrived back in 2020, reimagining the process of furniture removals in much the same chaotic way Overcooked reimagined culinary creation. And while the end result wasn&#x27;t &quot;quite as good&quot; as its obvious inspiration, as Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan suggested in his review at the time, it was &quot;still very special&quot;.


A extremely solid foundation, then, for more to come, and Moving Out 2 builds on the original by whisking the Furniture Arrangement and Relocation Technicians (F.A.R.Ts) &quot;beyond the realms of their dimension&quot; and into a succession of &quot;wildly different&quot; universes.

                              <span>Rockstar Games co-founder and creative director Dan Houser, who parted ways with the Grand Theft Auto developer in 2020, has formally unveiled Absurd Ventures, a media company established to create new IP across &quot;all platforms and formats&quot;.


Not much has been heard from Houser since his departure from Rockstar following an &quot;extended break&quot;, but rumblings of a return emerged last year when it was discovered he&#x27;d registered companies Absurd Ventures and Absurd Ventures in Games in both the US and UK.


And now, Houser&#x27;s new project has been officially revealed, with Absurd Ventures being described as a media company with a focus on &quot;building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium&quot;.

                              <span>Two and a half years after the launch of its Xbox Series X/S consoles, Microsoft has officially said goodbye the previous generation, with Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty now confirming no internal development team is working on new titles for Xbox One.


Booty shared the news in conversation with Axios, revealing all 23 of Microsoft&#x27;s internal Xbox studios - aside from those specifically working on support for ongoing games like Minecraft and Sea of Thieves - have now &quot;moved on to Gen 9&quot;. 


Despite that shift in focus, Booty says the company still plans to &quot;maintain support&quot; for Xbox One by making its Gen 9 titles - that is, games designed specifically for Xbox Series X/S - playable on the older platform via its cloud streaming technology.

                              <span>Fans of flamboyant fisticuffs are in for a bit of a treat over on the Epic Games Store this week; developer Drinkbox Studios&#x27; acclaimed Metroidvania-style twosome Guacamelee 1 &amp; 2 are currently free to download and keep.


The first Guacamelee (technically styled Guacamelee!, but the exclamation mark is a bit much), released in 2013, serving up a colourful mix of wrestling-inspired brawling and non-linear exploratory action, in which protagonist Juan Aguacate, suddenly infused with luchador powers, set out across a fantasy world inspired traditional Mexican culture and folklore to rescue El Presidente&#x27;s kidnapped daughter.


&quot;Like the best luchadores in the business,&quot; Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan wrote at the time of its release, &quot;Guacamelee has real heart and a blazing desire to put on a good show.&quot;

                              <span>A logo seemingly pointing to an unannounced remaster of Square Enix&#x27;s sci-fi action-RPG sequel Star Ocean: The Second Story has been discovered on the publisher&#x27;s website.


The unassuming asset in question, found squirrelled away on Square Enix&#x27;s support site (and which you can peruse at your leisure over on RPGSite), features a logo for a presumably unannounced title going by the name Star Ocean: The Second Story R.


While Square is yet to utter the name publicly, it&#x27;s not hard to conclude it references an unannounced remaster, given it uses the same naming convention as Star Ocean: First Departure R. That game, which released for Switch and PlayStation in 2019, was a remaster of 1998 PlayStation Portable game Star Ocean: First Departure (itself a remaster of the 1996 Super Famicom original), introducing the likes of difficulty rebalancing and new character art.

                              <span>Ever since Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released, players have been flexing their creative muscles by building a host of weird and wacky designs. This has included mechs, trucks, tanks and Korok torture devices. Someone even built a pilotable T-rex, because why not.


A month on, however, these in-game designs have evolved even further, and we are seeing Zonai-crafted orchestras and functioning calculators turn up in the game. 


As a quick reminder, Link&#x27;s new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects to create something completely new and unique.

Aired at 5am UK time, the 11-minute video offers little in the way of actual updates amongst its silliness. We get another trailer for the upcoming Shadows of the Damned Remastered and, right at the end, the sneakiest of peeks at what&#x27;s next from renowned game maker Suda51.


Looking closely at the gameplay footage (which Suda51 pretends to block to stop us seeing more), there&#x27;s a UI which shows health, blood and &quot;emerald flowsion&quot;. One of the weapons equipped is named &quot;Brynhildr&quot;.

                              <span>The New York Times is beta testing a game called Connections which has gained attention for its similarities to a round featured in BBC2 quiz show Only Connect.


In both games, players are shown 16 clues which must be categorised into four groups of four. Once a category is correctly identified, the clues are grouped together at the top of the board and asasigned a colour.


The only notable difference is that Connections refreshes each day and players can only make four mistakes (akin to Wordle), whilst in the Connecting Wall (as it&#x27;s known on Only Connect) players must solve the wall in two and a half minutes. Connecting Wall players have unlimited guesses until they&#x27;ve found two categories, after which they are only given three incorrect attempts.

                              <span>Steam has now officially added a host of handy new features to its client, following earlier beta testing.


This update sees the arrival of a redesigned in-game overlay, complete with new features, a notes function, pinnable in-game windows and improvements to notifications.


The ability to pin windows from the overlay means they appear on top of a game while you are still playing. This feature, the company has said, is available for Notes, Guides, Discussions, Achievements, and the web browser, so  is ideal for those &quot;multi-tasking maniacs who love to have a movie on in the background while they game&quot;.

It&#x27;s used the terminology of Closed Network Test previously, with Elden Ring for instance, but for Tekken 8 it&#x27;s created a logo with CNT on it.


It&#x27;s certainly raised some eyebrows among fans.

Speaking with Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation&#x27;s head of subscriptions Nick Maguire said putting games on to the service &quot;a bit later in the life cycle&quot; is working for Sony. Therefore, this will &quot;continue to be [its] strategy moving forward.&quot;


&quot;We&#x27;re happy with our strategy,&quot; Maguire told the publication. &quot;Putting games in a bit later in the life cycle has meant that we can reach more customers 12, 18, 24 months after they have released.&quot;

                              <span>Yakuza developer RGG Studio has released a statement to clear up confusion over the title of the next mainline game in the series.

When Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth was revealed at last week&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase, many (myself included) believed it was a completely new game being announced in the series, and not the sequel to 2020&#x27;s Yakuza: Like a Dragon. 

However, following subtle rewording of its marketing for the game, RGG Studio and publisher Sega explained that Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is actually the title for Like a Dragon 8, which was initially announced under that name in September last year.

                              <span>Having flung open the doors for sign-ups at the end of May, developer NetherRealm has now shared dates for Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s online stress test, confirming it&#x27;ll be available to select registered players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S starting Friday, 23rd June.


More specifically, Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s online stress test - which NetherRealm says is designed to &quot;deliberately stress our online infrastructure and identify potential issues&quot; ahead of launch - will run from Friday, 23rd June at 4pm BST/8am PDT through Monday, 26th June at the same time.


The test is open to Xbox Series X/S and PS5 players in North America, Latin America, Brazil, and Europe, but places are limited. Participants will be chosen at random from those who&#x27;ve registered on the Warner Bros. website, and registration is still open if you want to get involved.

                              <span>Well, here&#x27;s a surprise! Just when it looked like it would be all hands on deck until the arrival of Sea of Thieves&#x27; hugely anticipated (by me, I am the huge anticipant) Monkey Island crossover, developer Rare has announced it&#x27;ll be reviving the multiplayer pirate game&#x27;s limited-time Adventure series next week after a three-month absence.


Sea of Thieves&#x27; Adventures were introduced early last year in an effort to create meatier, more interesting monthly content drops, with the idea being each would form a playable instalment in an ongoing narrative. It&#x27;s been fun following along, even if their quality has varied wildly (and even if they resulted in the sacrifice of moustachioed seahunk Arthur Pendragon, which is a crime I will never forgive), but then Rare suddenly announced it would be temporarily &quot;hitting the pause button&quot; on Adventures back in March.


Whatever the reason for the pause (presumably the impending arrival of a certain G-brush), Rare is finally ready to resume monthly Adventures, starting with next week&#x27;s A Dark Deception, which runs from Thursday, 22nd June to Thursday, 6th July.

                              <span>People Can Fly, the studio behind Bullestorm and Ourtriders, has formally signed a work-for-hire agreement with Microsoft to develop a new project based on one of the Xbox maker&#x27;s IP.


The announcement come via a statement posted to Polish financial site Interia Biznes, in which People Can Fly notes the game, which has been given the codename Project Maverick, will be fully funded by Microsoft with a budget of $30m-50m.


As to what the mystery project could be, the most obvious guess would be some form of new entry in the Gears of War series given the studio&#x27;s previous connections with the franchise - it co-developed Gears of War: Judgment alongside its previous owner Epic Games in 2013, and was responsible for the Windows port of the original Gears of War prior to that.

                              <span>Dead Cells - the superb rogue-like action-platformer from Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire - is being turned into an 10-episode animated series for release next year.


The series is the work of Paris-based animation studio Bobbypills - the team behind Dead Cells&#x27; animated trailers, as well as Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon spinoff, Captain Laserhawk - and whisks viewers away to a cursed island ravaged by a strange plague. 


&quot;After the island&#x27;s foolish king develops a remedy that ends up turning the population into monstrous creatures,&quot; the official announcement explains, &quot;prophecies depicting a flame-headed hero begin to appear. As it so happens this beheaded hero is real, but saving a kingdom isn&#x27;t on his schedule and he just wants to be left alone.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a year since Sony relaunched its PlayStation Plus subscription service with multiple tiers, and today there&#x27;s word of an upcoming new feature: PS5 game streaming.


There&#x27;s no release date as yet, just word that Sony is &quot;testing&quot; the technology for select PS5 titles, including those in the subscription&#x27;s game catalogue, and others you may own. 


And to be clear, this will be a Premium tier benefit - so you won&#x27;t get it if you&#x27;re on regular old PlayStation Plus Essential or Extra.

                              <span>I liked the look of Last Train Home when it got its unveiling this week during not-E3. It&#x27;s a wintery period piece from Czech studio Ashborne Games, based on real events following World War 1. 


With the Great War over, you command a legion of Czech soldiers on a train bound for home via the Trans-Siberian railway. Their aim is to get back to the newly-created republic, but along the way there&#x27;s trouble - the Russian Civil War.


Real-time battles are interspersed with management of your soldiers while aboard the train - which can of course be upgraded as you journey through Siberia - making sure your units are in good health and well fed.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida previously told Eurogamer that Game of Thrones was a major influence on the upcoming game - something that&#x27;s now apparent from the many references to the series already obvious from the game&#x27;s freshly-released demo.
&quot;We wanted to create something that really resonated with a lot of people,&quot; Yoshida said previously. &quot;And when we saw how Game of Thrones, and before that the Song of Ice and Fire series, has really resonated with players, we knew that this was something that we wanted to do as well.&quot;


The development team were required to watch the Game of Thrones Blu-ray boxset in order to keep the series&#x27; style front-of-mind - something that is now apparent more than ever. Did George RR Martin secretly pop over to the Square Enix office while writing lore sheets for Elden Ring?

                              <span>Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver have given us a peek at Dead Island 2&#x27;s upcoming content.


In a new update, the team has unveiled two upcoming expansions. The first of these, known as Haus, will be released in Q4 of this year. 


&quot;How does a billionaire prepare for the zompocalypse?&quot; the Dead Island 2 team asks. Why, with a &quot;techno-death cult with a healthy splash of debauchery and gore&quot;, of course.

                              <span>Ready yourselves. Goosebump-inducing ghost hunting sim Phasmophobia is headed to PlayStation 5, including VR2, and Xbox Series X/S. 


The game will release across consoles in early access this August, although a specific date has not yet been announced. Developer Kinetic Games has, however, teased some of what console players can expect.


A new trailer gives a look at the various ghost hunting tools that will be in our arsenal, including ouija boards, crucifixes and those blacklight glow stick things that I am sure have a proper name but I can&#x27;t think of it right now. It is all suitably spooky, as you can see for yourself below.

                              <span>Diablo 4 players are adamant there&#x27;s a secret cow level in the game, even though Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson has denied its existence.


In an interview with Kinda Funny from May, Fergusson said people should not spend time looking for a secret level that wasn&#x27;t there. &quot;We really wanted to ground [Diablo 4] as much as possible,&quot; he said.  
&quot;We&#x27;ve had some fun, but we wanted to make sure it felt authentic to the gothic, dark themes we had. And because of that, there&#x27;s no secret level in Diablo 4 that people might be looking for, as per previous games.&quot;

                              <span>2K&#x27;s unannounced Lego football game has popped up on the Korean game ratings website. 


It&#x27;s called Lego 2K Goooal! (with three O&#x27;s). 


The game&#x27;s existence was first leaked last year by VGC, which reported the title as being developed by UK studio Sumo Digital, of Sonic Racing and LittleBigPlanet 3 fame. Now, the game has leaked again, via the ever-reliable Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea (thanks, Gematsu).

Sea of Stars was previously revealed to be coming to Xbox consoles in August this year (in addition to Switch, PC and PlayStation). Now it&#x27;s confirmed to be coming to Game Pass on day one too.



Then there&#x27;s Aggro Crab&#x27;s Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure, which is headed to all Xbox consoles and PC via Game Pass (alongside Switch and PC) when it releases in early 2024.

&quot;Titanfall 2 came out, did what it did, and we were like &#x27;OK, we&#x27;re going to make Titanfall 3&#x27;. And, we worked on Titanfall 3 for 10 months in earnest. We had the tech for it, and multiple missions going,&quot; Alavi revealed.

Word of the FTC&#x27;s intent to file an injunction first broke on Monday this week. The development blocks Microsoft from making any kind of move on Activision Blizzard, and brings the matter to a federal court. 


The FTC had previously set its own date for the deal to be debated by an internal administrative judge on 2nd August - after Microsoft&#x27;s own deadline to complete the merger on 18th July expires.

Gabe Amatangelo, game director and VP of the studio, further confirmed at which point the expansion unlocks and revealed there will be a new ending of the base game.


&quot;No, this takes place in the midst of [Cyberpunk 2077],&quot; Amatangelo told WCCFTech. &quot;You get to a certain point in the game and this unlocks, but of course, we let you skip right to it much like it was done in The Witcher 3&#x27;s expansions.&quot;

                              <span>Summer Game Fest&#x27;s live showcase might have struggled to consistently entertain with its saggy middle and excessive runtime, but the overall season-wide event has apparently already done what it needed to - producer Geoff Keighley has now confirmed Summer Game Fest will return next year, live showcase and all.


Summer Game Fest is currently in its fourth consecutive year - having initially started amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as a response to major in-person gaming events being shut down - and 2023&#x27;s offering has been bigger than ever.


It was, of course, originally expected to have some competition from the returning E3 this year, but after that show&#x27;s cancellation, Summer Game Fest swelled to fill the gap, hoovering up a number of publisher showcases and events under the Summer Game Fest banner.

                              <span>It&#x27;s finally almost time to ready your nozzles and prepare for a trip to the briny depths: PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s SpongeBob SquarePants DLC has a release date, and is launching for Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 29th June.


PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack was announced back in May but, beyond its Bikini Bottom setting, developer FuturLab didn&#x27;t give much away.


Now, though, with a release in sight, the studio is finally ready to share more, confirming its Spongebob DLC will feature a mini campaign split across six new maps: Conch Street, The Bikini Bottom Bus, The Krusty Krab, The Patty Wagon, The Invisible Boatmobile, and The Mermalair.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait for developer Slow Bros&#x27; gorgeous stop-motion-style space adventure Harold Halibut - but now, some seven years after its initial reveal, an end is in almost sight, with its Xbox, PlayStation, and PC release set for &quot;early&quot; next year.


Harold Halibut tells the story of a young lab assistant (the Harold of the title) forced to live his life onboard the Fedora, a city sized spaceship still submerged beneath an alien ocean 250 years after it fled Earth to preserve the human race.


While some of its inhabitants have reconciled themselves to a life on the sunken ship, others still works tirelessly to find a way to leave the planet and reach a new, dryer home. Harold&#x27;s story lies somewhere between all that, told in absolutely sumptuous style, part fully voiced stop-motion movie, part narrative-driven adventure.

                              <span>Shadowrun and Battletech studio Harebrained Schemes&#x27; extremely promising pulp-inspired tactical turn-based strategy adventure, The Lamplighters League, now has a release date, and is launching for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass on 3rd October.


The Lamplighters League unfolds in an alternative version of the 1930s, where players - taking control of the titular organisation&#x27;s gang of misfits and scoundrels - travel the world in an effort to thwart the Banished Court cult&#x27;s nefarious schemes.


It&#x27;s an adventure that&#x27;ll swoop from dockyards and other urban corners to far more exotic locales, including deserts and jungles. Here, players must battle the Banished Court&#x27;s army using a mix of real-time infiltration, stealth, turn-based tactical combat, and team management.

                              <span>Tango Gameworks&#x27; sublime rhythm-action adventure Hi-Fi Rush is getting a great bit dollop of free new content on 5th July, including two new modes, new photo mode features, and more.


Everything included in Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s new Arcade Challenge update (as it&#x27;s officially known) will only be available after beating the base game. Once that&#x27;s done, a new arcade cabinet is added to the hideout, unlocking the new BPM Rush and Power up! Tower up! modes.


BPM Rush presents players with a series of encounters where the beat gets faster and faster as enemies are defeated, gradually rising all the way up to 200BPM. Tango notes that while this new addition is really designed for players in search of a tougher challenge, it&#x27;ll actually feature an Easy and Casual difficulty setting too so everyone can give it a try.

                              <span>Acclaimed heavy metal rhythm shooter Metal: Hellsinger is taking a tilt toward pop in its new Essential Hits Pack DLC, which launches today on Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s FPS action, if you&#x27;ve not yet made its acquaintance, sees players traversing eight musically infused Hells, armed with a blade and an appropriately devastating assortment of guns. The twist, though, is enemies take way more damage when an attack lands on the beat, turning its demon slaughter into wonderfully satisfying dance of bullets and steel.


To date, all music in Metal: Hellsinger and its earlier DLC has been firmly in the realm of heavy metal and written specifically for the game. However, its newly revealed Essential Hits Pack DLC sets its sights on a different crowd, taking things in a poppier direction with eight licensed tracks that can replace the base game&#x27;s existing tunes.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re back to wrap up the end of a tiring but intriguing week of Summer Game Fest and not-E3 announcements, which offered us the usual mixed bag of presentations, CG trailers, and the occaisonal musical interlude.

What were our favourites? There was a real variety of things on offer, from Dont Nod&#x27;s Jusant and Compulsion&#x27;s stylish-looking South of Midnight to blockbusters like Star Wars Outlaws and Fable. And then, of course, there was the inescapable Starfield - which after nearly a full hour deep dive I still feel like we&#x27;ve only seen a small portion.
Microsoft did well, I thought. Ubisoft did pretty good. Capcom... put in an appearance to delay Pragmata. But what were our favourite games on offer, and how convinced were we by Todd Howard&#x27;s marketing spiel? Joining me to discuss all that are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

Silicon Valley has produced no small number of moral disappointments. Google retired its “don’t be evil” pledge before firing its star ethicist.

                              <span>Video game mega publisher Embracer, which this morning announced a &quot;comprehensive restructuring plan&quot;, says it must now &quot;exploit&quot; the fact it owns the rights to Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit &quot;in a very signficant fashion&quot;. 


Speaking via an investor call held in the wake of today&#x27;s announcement that it would restructure the company, Embracer&#x27;s newly-promoted interim exec Matthew Karch said the business must now prioritise pumping out Lord of the Rings projects ahead of other game ideas which might not perform as well. 


&quot;We own Lord of the Rings, and we know we need to be exploiting Lord of the Rings in a very significant fashion and turning that into one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world,&quot; Karch said. &quot;And that&#x27;s obviously something we&#x27;re going to be doing.

                              <span>Netflix is yet to air the first episode of its Tomb Raider animation, but it already looks to have renewed the series for a second season.


Additionally, it appears that Ncuti Gatwa - star of Sex Education and the upcoming Fifteenth Doctor in Doctor Who - will join the cast.


As reported by What&#x27;s on Netflix, Gatwa will voice Eshu, a new character for the franchise. Gatwa&#x27;s Spotlight profile has been updated to include this role under the casting site&#x27;s &#x27;further&#x27; section.

Booty appeared on the Giant Bomb podcast with Xbox boss Phil Spencer to discuss the Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct.


&quot;We have an awful lot of people internally playing it,&quot; said Booty. &quot;Working with Todd and the team, I see bug counts and just by the numbers, if it shipped today, this would have the fewest bugs that any game from Bethesda has ever shipped with.&quot;

                              <span>BioWare has removed a bizarre statue of Mass Effect&#x27;s dying Commander Shepard from its online store, following fan confusion and upset.
The statue appeared on the BioWare Gear Store yesterday, and features (yes, you guessed it) the dead female body of Commander Shepard floating around in space as seen in the opening to Mass Effect 2. The statue was priced at $135 and its store page stated only 2000 would be available worldwide.
Needless to say, a statue suddenly being sold that depicts a dying character is a bit odd to begin with. The posing of FemShep is also a bit much - why the slightly arched back? Out of context, it looks a bit like Shepard&#x27;s death is being sexualised and fetishised. And why only FemShep? What about if I want a statue of male Shepard limply floating about?

                              <span>Blizzard has laid out more of its plans for Overwatch 2&#x27;s Invasion update, which is due to arrive this August. This includes a paid-for add-on that includes &quot;permanent access&quot; to three story missions, which will cost $15.


As a quick recap, Blizzard has promised &quot;new Story Missions, an all-new PVP core game mode, new ways to build on your skills with your favourite heroes... and a new Support hero&quot; for Overwatch 2: Invasion. 


These story missions will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Gothenburg, with each location featuring &quot;massive maps&quot; and &quot;complex objectives&quot;. Players will find themselves taking on the series&#x27; Null Sector group, with the story set to continue in future seasons of the game.

                              <span>Embracer has announced a &quot;comprehensive restructuring program&quot; which will result in studio closures, project cancellations and job losses.


The Swedish umbrella company has grown enormously through acquisitions over the past five years, and now owns a swathe of studios such as Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics, Borderlands maker Gearbox, rights to franchises such as The Lord of the Rings, and an array of other publishers such as Plaion, Saber and THQ Nordic.


But while amassing its empire, Embracer is yet to see a big return. Last year&#x27;s big bet, its Saints Row reboot, was a critical and commercial failure. More recently, the company suffered a body blow when a major unannounced $2bn deal fell through, prompting its shares to plummet by an eye-watering 40 percent.

Ghost Trick, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, comes from Ace Attorney designer Shu Takumi and follows the adventures of Sissel, a sharp-dressing amnesiac who&#x27;s surprised to wake up extremely and unequivocally dead at the start of the game.


On the plus side, Sissel&#x27;s quickly learns his newfound spirit form grants him the ability to possess inanimate objects, enabling him to influence events and, in gameplay terms, progress to the next portion of Ghost Trick&#x27;s wonderfully told story.

Much like Phoenix Attorney: Ace Attorney Trilogy, the Apollo Justice Trilogy will also feature an updated UI and hi-resolution artwork.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s oddball astronaut and small girl-starring Pragmata has been delayed yet again. 


The mysterious project was first announced with a bizarre teaser back in 2020, when it was set for a futuristic-sounding 2022 launch. A year later, that release date was pushed back to 2023. And now, in 2023, it has been further delayed - this time, to a year unknown.


Tonight, during the Capcom Showcase, the publisher confirmed we&#x27;d need to wait longer once more - though we did get another teaser beforehand. You can watch that below:

                              <span>Arkane Austin has released a first major patch for its widely derided co-op vampire shooter Redfall, promising &quot;incremental improvements&quot; across a range of areas including gameplay, combat, and AI - but its promised 60fps mode for Xbox Series X is still nowhere to be seen.


Redfall released to a less-than-stellar reception back in May, with Digital Foundry calling the Xbox version a &quot;sad tale of unfulfilled potential and profound technical issues&quot;, while its PC counterpart was so hampered by poor performance, technical problems, and bugs, Digital Foundry&#x27;s Alex Battaglia said there was the sense it &quot;just isn&#x27;t finished&quot;.


Launch was bad enough that Xbox boss Phil Spencer took the step of apologising to players, admitting, &quot;We let a lot of people down this week&quot;, leaving many to wonder how - and if - Arkane Austin could turn things around.

                              <span>US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly set to file an injunction with a federal court in an effort to temporarily halt Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


The FTC sued to block Microsoft&#x27;s proposed deal back in December, claiming it would allow the company to suppress its games industry competition. The hearing for that case - which will be deliberated by the FTC&#x27;s own internal administrative law judge - is set for 2nd August, after Microsoft&#x27;s 18th July merger deadline expires.


As reported by CNBC, citing a source familiar with the matter, the FTC is now taking steps to prevent Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard deal from going ahead before its internal hearing can take place, by filing for an injunction with a US District Court.

                              <span>XDefiant, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming Tom-Clancy-inspired free-to-play shooter, is holding its first Open Session test later this month on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.


XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division - was initially announced as Tom Clancy&#x27;s XDefiant back in 2021, but Ubisoft chose to drop the Tom Clancy branding after criticism from fans that felt its flamboyant action strayed too far from the franchise&#x27;s more serious military themes and formula.


Development has quietly continued since then, with Ubisoft occasionally opening XDefiant up to registered &quot;insiders&quot; to canvas feedback, and a recent closed beta finally brought the game into the hands of a much broader audience, with over 1m players ultimately getting to spend some time with its first-person shooting action.

Now that the Ubisoft Forward presentation has come to a close, it&#x27;s time to go over everything that was shown during this trailer-filled summer showcase. It included a variety of updates for upcoming games and a selection of reveals - all of which you can find below with their accompanying trailer. 
Below you&#x27;ll be able to take a look at Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, among many other titles, ending with our first glimpse at gameplay from Star Wars Outlaws.
Ubisoft Forward began with the trailer for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, which will be released on 7th December 2023:

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward has given us a closer look at the trio of Assassin&#x27;s Creed titles set to launch in 2023, including the Baghdad-set Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, VR title Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus and smartphone entry Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Jade.


We began with a look at Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus, which is due to launch for Meta Quest 2. Tonight provided our first real detail of the game, including the fact it will star three of the series&#x27; best-loved protagonists: Ezio, Kassandra and Connor.


Nexus will boast a &quot;full single-player campaign&quot;, Ubisoft said, with an Abstergo-set modern day threat revolving around the evil tech company trying to use people&#x27;s memories to sway their behaviour - and even their voting preferences. It&#x27;s perhaps a bold choice of narrative for a game set to be played on Mark Zuckerburg-branded hardware.

                              <span>Almost exactly two years to the day of its original announced, Netflix&#x27;s exuberant animated Far Cry adaptation, Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, has received its first trailer.


Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix comes from series creator and writer Adi Shankar - who helped bring Netflix&#x27;s acclaimed Castlevania adaptation to life - and is described as a &quot;love letter from the 90s&quot;. 


Unless its story has changed dramatically since its unveiling in 2021, it all takes place in parallel version of Earth where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data. Enter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier, who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before sailing off into the sunset with his boyfriend Alex.

Accompanying this news, Ubisoft shared a gameplay overview trailer for the upcoming release. It transports us to the franchise&#x27;s never-before-seen Western Frontier, and covers things such as skill upgrades, mounts (you will be able to tame your own banshee) and introduces some of the game&#x27;s new Na&#x27;vi clans. 


It all looks rather Far Cry (our Na&#x27;vi has weapons training) with a dash of Horizon Forbidden West, if you ask me, but I will let you judge for yourself below.

Pay attention to the techniques:
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing...</span>

                              <span>Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, the fantastical stealth-strategy pirate adventure from Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blade of the Shogun studio Mimimi Games, is launching for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 17th August.


Shadow Gambit&#x27;s top-down tactical action - which should be immediately familiar to fans of Mimimi Games&#x27; previous titles - unfolds in a &quot;dynamic, immersive sandbox&quot; given an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. It sees players climbing board their living ghost ship, The Red Marley, to explore the Caribbean in an alternative version of the Golden Age of Piracy.


As they set out in search of the legendary Captain Mordechai&#x27;s lost treasure, with the Inquisition of the Burning Maiden in pursuit, they&#x27;ll gradually acquire a crew of cursed pirates with supernatural powers that can be assembled into teams for use in missions around the world.

                              <span>There&#x27;s light at the end of the not-E3 Summer Games Fest 2023 conference tunnel, but still enough time for Uncle Yves to uncork his content pipe and provide us with an update on everything Ubisoft.


We likely know the full schedule for tonight, with two just-revealed titles set to get a more thorough showing. Those, of course, are Star Wars Outlaws from Division studio Massive, unveiled last night at Xbox Games Showcase, and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which we got a glimpse of at Summer Game Fest. 


It&#x27;s a Ubisoft show, so there&#x27;ll be some Assassin&#x27;s Creed. We&#x27;re looking forward to seeing more of the upcoming back-to-basics Mirage, and potentially some of VR game Nexus and Ancient China-set mobile entry Jade. Then there&#x27;s likely to be Forza Horizon-like The Crew Motorfest, plus the latest release date for Skull and Bones.

                              <span>UPDATE 12/06/2023: Developer Terrible Toybox has contacted Eurogamer to address Ron Gilbert&#x27;s earlier statements regarding the Monkey Island and Sea of Thieves crossover. 
&quot;Disney did give him a heads-up on the project as a courtesy, but the game was well into development at that point and he wasn&#x27;t given the opportunity to be meaningfully involved,&quot; Terrible Toybox&#x27;s PR told Eurogamer.
The original story continues below.

                              <span>Last night, developer Compulsion unveiled its new game South of Midnight, and introduced us to its heroine, Hazel. 


Hazel is a Weaver, a &quot;magical mender of broken bonds and spirits&quot;. Compulsion has described her as &quot;outwardly confident, wisecracking, and actively on the hunt&quot;. Hazel is also Black, something that narrative producer and creative specialist James Lewis lamented is &quot;unfortunately... still pretty unique for video games&quot;. 


Thankfully, the South of Midnight developer has ensured its Black heroine was created by Black women and women of colour, calling this inclusion &quot;key for understanding and writing Hazel&#x27;s voice.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft and developer Asobo have moved to assure Microsoft Flight Simulator players the current 2020 release will continue to receive updates after yesterday&#x27;s announcement of a &quot;standalone sequel&quot; shed doubt the companies would continue their long-standing pledge to provide 10 years&#x27; worth of support for the current game.


Microsoft Flight Simulator head Jorg Neumann initially spoke of the studio&#x27;s plans to support the 2020 version of the sim for a decade back in 2019, a year prior to its release, and it&#x27;s a stance that&#x27;s been reiterated intermittently ever since. As such, there was much confusion among fans following last night&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase reveal of a standalone sequel for 2024 - particularly as Neumann had already hinted at some of its flagship new features, including cargo delivery jobs, in relation to the current sim.


Now though, in an effort to quell confusion and de-escalate mounting controversy, Neumann has offered clarification on continued support for the 2020 release in a FAQ posted on the Flight Simulator website, beginning with the reiteration that Flight Simulator 2024 is a &quot;standalone simulator and the next-generation sequel&quot; and not an update for the existing game.

The reveal sparked immediate comparisons to BioShock Infinite from many viewers, thanks to its setting, combat, characters, enemy designs...

The similarities did not escape the eye of Twitter user Butmac, who said they produced the trailers for BioShock Infinite which were released in the run-up to the game&#x27;s launch in 2013.

                              <span>Everyone knows the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol is the Muppets version - and there&#x27;s no way this can be beaten. Still, if you&#x27;re looking for another oddball take on Ebenezer Scrooge, there&#x27;s a new adventure for the Victorian miser now on the horizon. 


Ebenezer Scrooge and the Invisible World is a side-scrolling platform adventure with something of a Doctor Who Christmas special to it, while the art style gives me vibes of Forgotton Anne. 


Scrooge - acting here as the protagonist and good guy - must jump and fight his way across London to fight wealthy industrialist Caspar Malthus, a press release reveals, using &quot;a team of spectral allies&quot; to fight Malthus&#x27; own private guard.

                              <span>Capcom has made a selection of its retro games playable in-browser to celebrate the company&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

The games can be found by visiting Capcom Town, a website set up specifically for the anniversary and which was first teased back in March.

The site acts as a hub for all the different franchises Capcom owns, and you can hover over all the pins to find links to websites for each. There&#x27;s also plenty of Capcom&#x27;s most famous characters dotted around - I&#x27;m particularly enjoying watching Jill Valentine strolling around in horror as she&#x27;s followed by Nemesis and his huge rocket launcher.

Persona 3 was re-released as Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable: the former included a new playable epilogue, while the latter included a new female protagonist, the ability to directly control party members, and other major changes.


However, this won&#x27;t be included in Reload as the development team focus on &quot;recreating the Persona 3 experience&quot;.

                              <span>A free and extensive update for Vampire Survivors is available today. Developer Poncle shared this news during the PC Gaming Show last night, revealing update 1.5 will introduce players to a new stage known as Astral Stair. 


The team has dubbed this stage as &quot;chaotic&quot;, and I can understand why. This level will see players coming face to face with &quot;seemingly endless corridors, flying paintings&quot; and, my personal favourite, &quot;a gameshow-like spinning wheel that triggers random events&quot;. 


There is also a new pick up known as GoldFinger, and if you didn&#x27;t read that and immediately start singing Shirley Bassey then, I am sorry, but I am not sure we can remain friends. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.

                              <span>The Banner Saga trilogy developer Stoic has announced Towerborne, a side-scrolling co-op action adventure for PC and Xbox, coming next year. 


This is the project previously referred to internally as Project Belfry, and was revealed in the Xbox Games Showcase last night as coming from both Stoic and Xbox Game Studios. The suggestion is it won&#x27;t be coming to other consoles. 


After some new apocalypse razes humanity&#x27;s cities, survivors accumulate in the Belfry, a towering windmill that looks like something from the Moomins.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 will be available to play today in demo form, Square Enix has confirmed. 


The highly-anticipated demo will go live for PlayStation 5 in the UK at 9am - that&#x27;s 4am Eastern time or 1am Pacific.


The demo will contain &quot;two lengthy sections&quot; showcasing Final Fantasy 16, beginning with the game&#x27;s opening prologue. A PlayStation blog update states this will likely last you around two and a half hours, and will give you a look at main character Clive&#x27;s backstory.

                              <span>Xbox console exclusive Starfield will be locked to 30fps on Xbox Series X and S, Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard has confirmed. 
On Xbox Series X, it will run at 4K resolution. On Xbox Series S, it will run at 1440p. 


Speaking to IGN, Howard said Starfield sometimes ran at 60fps in development on console, but that Bethesda had taken the decision to lock its framerate because &quot;we prefer the consistency&quot;.


&quot;I think it&#x27;ll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for,&quot; Howard said. &quot;Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen.&quot;

In a post-event roundtable in Los Angeles attended by Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell, Booty said that Microsoft&#x27;s output was entering a new era.


&quot;We had some gaps last year, but I think we&#x27;ve turned the corner coming into 2023,&quot; Booty said. &quot;[I] feel very good about launching Hi-Fi Rush, we have Minecraft Legends out there which is doing well, we have Age of Empires continuing to come to console... and then as we saw today, this fall we have Forza Motorsport and Starfield.&quot;

Things are a little bit different this time around, with Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector introducing a brand-new - and steadily declining - Sleeper android protagonist, alongside a new setting where players will need to build themselves a life among the starts.


This particular Sleeper has been hiding out in the Starward Belt at the edge of the Helion System, and, having rewritten their own code in an effort to escape servitude, is now on the run with a malfunctioning body, a bounty on their head, and no memory of their past.

Though a sequel to the popular, icy city-builder was announced back in August 2021, an official release window was never announced.

                              <span>At first glance, tonight&#x27;s reveal trailer for Clockwork Revolution looked like a new game set in the world of BioShock Infinite&#x27;s floating city of Colombia. 


There were the steampunk machines, the gleaming statues and overhead skyrails, the alternate history Americana. The first-person visuals and chunky golden guns didn&#x27;t help things either. 


But no, this is the completely legally distinct Clockwork Revolution, from Wasteland 3 developer InXile Entertainment, and this &quot;vibrant steam-powered metropolis&quot; is named Avalon.

                              <span>Colossal Order&#x27;s eagerly awaited city building sequel Cities: Skylines 2 has had a big news day! Not only has the developer shared a first gameplay trailer, it&#x27;s announced a 24th October release date on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


Publisher Paradox Interactive officially unveiled the sequel back in March, calling it a &quot;revolutionary&quot; spin on the acclaimed 2015 original and the &quot;most open-ended city-building sandbox on the planet&quot;. Other than talk of a &quot;fully-realised transport and economy systems&quot;, however, specifics remained pretty thin.


Courtesy of tonight&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase, though, we&#x27;ve now had our first proper look at Cities: Skylines 2 in action, with Colossal Order showing off a sequel that notably ramps up the realism, in terms of visuals at least.

                              <span>The Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct 2023 has come and gone! Over the course of nearly two hours, we saw a huge variety of Xbox titles, including new reveals and updates for ones already on the slate, and, most importantly, we also got a detailed look at Starfield.
Outside of Starfield, highlights included South of Midnight, Star Wars Outlaws, Avowed, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and a new trailer for Fable (though still no release date). Many of the games shown will also be available from Game Pass from day one.
The show began with the Fable trailer narrated by Richard Ayoade, AKA Dave - a giant-sized vegetable enthusiast. While a release date and final name are yet to be annouced, this upcoming addition to the Fable series will of course be available on Game Pass from day one:

The breathtaking Keanu Reeves, who is reprising his role as Johnny Silverhand for the DLC, introduced the new trailer for Phantom Liberty, saying it was an honour to share the screen with Elba. 


In Phantom Liberty, players will be travel to Dog Town, an &quot;all new district&quot; of Night City, where they have to rescue the president of the New United Stated of America. CDPR describes Phantom Liberty as a &quot;spy-thriller&quot;, with Reeves telling us to expect &quot;twists, secrets and plenty of stuff to do&quot;.

The game features an anime style familiar to fans of Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, but an all-new setting and characters.


It&#x27;s more dramatic, however, with a seemingly sprawling map. Check out the trailer below.

This fresh model launches on 1st September, Xbox chief Phil Spencer announced tonight at the Xbox Showcase. It&#x27;s priced at $349, which is $50 more than the standard Xbox Series S at $299.


We&#x27;re checking to find UK pricing and release details right now.

In Still Wakes the Deep, players take on the role of an off-shore oil rig worker - stationed on the Beira D oil rig off the Scottish coast circa 1975 - who finds himself &quot;fighting for his life through a vicious storm, perilous surroundings, and the dark, freezing North Sea waters.&quot;


All communications with the outside world have been severed, all the exits are gone, and, worse, there&#x27;s something terrible onboard.

                              <span>One of the most promising micro-trends at this years&#x27; summer showcases is everyone discovering that climbing is rad, and climbing videogames are double rad because if you fall you don&#x27;t die. Anyway, continuing this theme, Life is Strange developer Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s new Jusant looks absolutely stellar.


It&#x27;s a sci-fi climbing game, by the looks of it, in which a young hero climbs endless mountain walls with a funny little creature for company. There looks to be puzzling, interaction with mountain communities, a range of surfaces to climb on, and a sprinkling of futuristic stuff. And at one point you ride a mushroom.


The sense of place - and the lighting, cor - is just wonderful. And the game&#x27;s due out in 2023. Cannot wait for this one.

                              <span>Capcom revealed Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, a brand new action game, at this year&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase.


Little is known about the game, but it&#x27;s set for release on Xbox consoles and will arrive on Game Pass.


Steeped in Japanese tradition and folklore, its visuals blend beautifully detailed costumes with bizarre creatures and some stunning kaleidoscopic floral effects. Check it out below.

                              <span>Fallout 76&#x27;s next expansion will take Bethesda&#x27;s game to Atlantic City, the spiritual home of Monopoly, according to a nifty animated trailer that dropped during Xbox&#x27;s summer showcase.


The video announced that after Appalachia had welcomed 15 million dwellers, Atlantic City beckons. New Jersey&#x27;s pleasure city was invoked with a lot of gambling imagery and a neat riff on one of Springsteen&#x27;s greatest songs, which I enjoyed at least.


Not much else to say at the moment, but the game is &quot;coming soon&quot;. If you get a chance, do dust off Nebraska, which is one of the Boss&#x27; finest.

                              <span>Xbox has confirmed that Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 will arrive in 2024. A new trailer was also shared as part of this evening&#x27;s Xbox Showcase. 


It is all rather chilling, with Xbox proclaiming that viewers will be able to &quot;Sink deep into the next chapter of Senua&#x27;s story&quot; thanks to the trailer&#x27;s &quot;cinematic immersion,  beautifully realised visuals and encapsulating sound from the team at Ninja Theory&quot;. 


It really is quite something, I have to say.  The footage for this trailer, which you can see below, was captured on Xbox Series X.

                              <span>A new Like a Dragon game has just been announced at Xbox Games Showcase. This time, starring Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga called Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. 
I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happening, neither is Ichiban, but the trailer and title of the game are exactly the kind of frivolous fun we&#x27;ve come to expect from the Like a Dragon series. The trailer shows a very naked Ichiban waking up on a beach somewhere in America. I don&#x27;t know either, pals.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is slated for an early 2024 release on Xbox and PC.

Now we can finally see gameplay of its vibrant world and first-person magical combat. Check it out below.

                              <span>Two years of furiously willing it into existence has paid off! Monkey Island is finally FINALLY coming to Sea of Thieves in a major story crossover starting on 20th July this year.


It&#x27;s not a complete surprise, of course; Rare first teased a Monkey Island crossover for Sea of Thieves back in 2021, tucked in a tiny corner of the game&#x27;s Pirates of the Caribbean adventure. And now self-proclaimed mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood and friends will be getting similar treatment across three brand-new Tall Tales.


Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island - as the crossover is officially known - begins on Mêlée Island, where Threepwood is inexplicably receiving adulation from his peers. What follows is a &quot;love-letter to the classic adventure game&quot; that&#x27;ll feature a host of familiar faces, including Murray, LeChuck, and more.

It&#x27;s like Asobo sat down and brainstormed every use for a plane that&#x27;s not just flying from A to B, and worked to put it in Microsoft Flight Sim. The list is frankly astonishing, and includes:


Aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, air ambulance, crop dusting, mountain rescue, skydive aviation, aerial construction, cargo transport, VIP charter service, air racing, glider pilot, scientific research, low altitude training, experimental trips, executive transport service, airship tours and hot air balloon trips. Phew.

                              <span>At Xbox&#x27;s 2023 showcase today we just got out first glimpse of Thunder Lotus&#x27; new game. The developer behind Spiritfarer and Sundered has been working on 33 Immortals, a top-down action-RPG roguelite with a delicate hand-painted art style and co-op for 33 players. What?!


It looks like a fascinating piece of work, with a delicate, rather serious tone, sonorous choral music, and delicate animation. But also: 33 players in an action-RPG! Based on a bit of gameplay, 33 Immortals won&#x27;t scrimp when it comes to throwing loads of enemies your way, and there was a lovely bullet hell element to some of the spells going off.


33 Immortals will be released in 2024 for Xbox X/S, and will appear day one on Game Pass.

                              <span>Compulsion, the developer behind We Happy Few, has unveiled its new game: South of Midnight. 


The game was introduced as part of this evening&#x27;s Xbox showcase. 


It is described as a &quot;fantastical&quot; and &quot;macabre third-person action-adventure&quot;, which is set in the American Deep South. Here is a little trailer for it.

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s Xbox Showcase gave us our first quick look at Star Wars Outlaws, from Ubisoft Massive, developer of The Division. It&#x27;s coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2024.


A CGI trailer showed a bounty hunter-stuffed trailer starring a smuggler character named Kay. What we saw offered just a glimpse, but it was very, very Star Wars.


Cue scenes with Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters, people frozen in carbonite, and at least one Hutt.

                              <span>Richard Ayoade will star in Fable, as revealed in a new teaser trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase.


The UK comedian narrates the trailer as &#x27;Dave, vegetable enthusiast&#x27;, injecting a healthy dose of British humour the series is known for.


At least, until he&#x27;s actually an in-game giant.

                              <span>New research suggests that AIs can produce perfectly secure steganographic images:
Abstract: Steganography is the practice of encoding secret information into innocuous content in such a manner that an adversarial third party would not realize that there is hidden meaning. While this problem has classically been studied in security literature, recent advances in generative models have led to a shared interest among security and machine learning researchers in developing scalable steganography techniques. In this work, we show that a steganography procedure is perfectly secure under Cachin (1998)’s information theoretic-model of steganography if and only if it is induced by a coupling. Furthermore, we show that, among perfectly secure procedures, a procedure is maximally efficient if and only if it is induced by a minimum entropy coupling. These insights yield what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography algorithms to achieve perfect security guarantees with non-trivial efficiency; additionally, these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical validation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three modern baselines—arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping—using GPT-2, WaveRNN, and Image Transformer as communication channels. We find that the minimum entropy coupling-based approach achieves superior encoding efficiency, despite its stronger security constraints. In aggregate, these results suggest that it may be natural to view information-theoretic steganography through the lens of minimum entropy coupling...</span>

I&#x27;ll be keeping tabs of everything that happens right here in a live report, while also chatting with you and pulling in your keen observations and witty remarks. We&#x27;ll play guess the game! It&#x27;s going to be so much fun you won&#x27;t even believe it.

                              <span>Talking to Eurogamer at Summer Games Fest today, Sonic Team vice president of product development Takashi Iizuka has clarified the question of the newly unveiled Sonic Superstars&#x27; main developer: it&#x27;s being led by Arzest, the Japanese studio which recently co-developed Fantasian and the troubled Balan Wonderworld - and that&#x27;s headed up by Sonic&#x27;s original creator Naoto Ohshima.
&quot;This is a brand new classic Sonic Game that&#x27;s been developed,&quot; Iizuka-san said, via translator, &quot;and in order to recreate that classic Sonic gameplay, we needed someone who understands the classic Sonic series and understands that gameplay format, in order to really execute well on the final product.&quot;
&quot;And so we&#x27;re working together, with Naoto Ohshima-san, who is the creator of Sonic the Hedgehog and was there at Sonic 1, creating and developing the game. We&#x27;re working with Ooshima-san and his team at Arzest, they&#x27;re leading development on the title and they&#x27;re doing a great job of making a brand new classic Sonic game.&quot;

                              <span>Lovable plasticine pals Wallace and Gromit are getting a new video game - and this time, it&#x27;s a VR title for Meta Quest 2. 


Wallace and Gromit in the Grand Getaway was announced tonight via a quick teaser trailer at the Future Game Show. In it, we see a return of the duo&#x27;s spaceship from 1989 adventure A Grand Day Out, which Wallace has apparently piloted to an alien world. 


Where have Wallace and Gromit got to? Judging by the purple ringed planet in the sky and the sci-fi mountains nearby, this isn&#x27;t anywhere nearby. Let&#x27;s take a look:

                              <span>Mario voice actor Chris Pratt has discussed the inevitable sequel to the box office-breaking Super Mario Bros. Movie, and said that news on what comes next should be coming &quot;soon&quot;. 


Exactly how soon, however, seems to depend on the ongoing writer&#x27;s strike which has shutdown much of Hollywood.


&quot;We&#x27;re in the midst of this writers&#x27; strike, and so everything has been paused and on hold for the right reasons,&quot; Pratt told Entertainment Tonight.

                              <span>Yakuza fans are struggling to find out if there will be physical copies of upcoming spin-off Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name available to buy in the West.


The game&#x27;s official website confirms there will be a disc-based version in Asia - though only for PlayStation consoles, allowing PS4 copies to be played on PS5 consoles with disc drives. For the game&#x27;s PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S formats, &quot;no physical edition will be released&quot;. 


Outside of Asia, the situation is less clear. Local versions of the official website for the UK and USA omit any mention of a physical release, and simply point to digital storefronts for the game on all formats - PC, PlayStation and Xbox.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage sees Ubisoft&#x27;s historical stabathon series return to its roots with more grounded combat and abilities, a map focused entirely around one city, and a return to the Middle East - where the franchise began. 


Now, Ubisoft has revealed a further option that nods all the way back to Assassin&#x27;s Creed 1 (which, I&#x27;m slightly alarmed to acknowledge, is now nearing its 16th birthday).


Where Mirage&#x27;s colour palette is all golden sunrays and splashes of crimson, the original AC1 had a much bluer filter. To me, it pointed to the fact your historical adventures were all just a simulation - similar to the green palette employed in The Matrix films.

Starfield will (hopefully) launch on 6th September and we&#x27;ll get a much better look at it this Sunday 11th June, as part of Microsoft&#x27;s summer announcement show. It there&#x27;s we expect to see these leaked retail versions of the game  officially announced.


For now, reliable Dealabs leaker billbil-kun, has detailed that Starfield will launch with a standard version of the game (€70 on PC, €80 on Xbox Series X/S), a Premium Edition (around €105 on PC, €115 on Xbox Series X/S) and the hulking €300 Constellation Edition, which is the same price for either format.

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has said it will act to improve the game&#x27;s quality levels, after a recent snafu left players spending time and money hunting rare Shiny Pokémon with far lower-than-expected odds. 


The bug, which Niantic previously told Eurogamer was an &quot;unfortunate technical error&quot;, was eventually fixed by the developer only after fans worked to crowdsource data and diagnose the problem for themselves.


It was the latest in a string of issues which seem to regularly affect the hugely-successful mobile app, with the  release of Pokémon and the launch of in-game events frequently marred by some problem or other - particularly in early timezones such as New Zealand and Australia, where it is now a running joke in the game&#x27;s community that players act as unofficial beta testers.

                              <span>Blasphemous 2, the sequel to developer The Game Kitchen gorgeously grim 2019 action-platformer, finally has a release date and is heading to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC on 24th August this year.


Like its enormously enjoyable predecessor, Blasphemous 2 is part Metroidvania, part Souls-like, marrying a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling imagery.


Blasphemous 2 sees the return of pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One in an adventure set across a unfamiliar land - a labyrinthine new kingdom promising a &quot;series of enchantingly grotesque landscapes&quot;, and ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

                              <span>Developer Overkill Software&#x27;s perenially popular co-operative heist-&#x27;em-up Payday 2 is currently free to download and keep on the Epic Games Store.


Released all the way back in 2013, Payday 2 sees teams of up to four players turning to a life of crime, embarking on a career of increasingly outlandish heists across Washington DC.


Payday 2&#x27;s development officially ceased at the end of 2018, amid financial difficulties for Overkill&#x27;s parent company Starbreeze, but the game recieved a surprise resurrection the following year, and updates of various sizes have continued to release since then.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to last night&#x27;s Summer Game Fest opening livestream, which offered us a first look at new Sonic and Prince of Persia games, plus a mouth-watering glimpse at Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth.

What didn&#x27;t we see? A little oddly, Square Enix decided not to showcase Final Fantasy 16 - the one which actually goes on sale in a couple of weeks. Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty was also missing, as was host Geoff Keighley&#x27;s best pal Hideo Kojima. Once the conference concluded, discussion online focused on the lack of any women on stage, following appearances by a string of male developers - and also Nic Cage.
On the upside, no one unexpectedly walked on stage and got arrested. So, how do we feel about all that, and how would we rate the conference overall? Was it a satisfying alternative to E3? Or are we hoping for more now from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom over the coming days? Joining me to discuss all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>At the Devolver Direct showcase, the publisher announced brand new game Baby Steps, from the developer behind Ape Out and Getting Over It.


It is, quite literally, a walking simulator and features adult man-baby Nate (not of the Drake variety) learning how to walk.


Nate, you see, is unemployed and lives with his parents, spending his time nestled in front of the television until he&#x27;s sucked into a fantasy world inside the screen.

According to well-informed film critic Jeff Sneider, Universal and Illumination are close to closing a &quot;big deal&quot; with Nintendo to adapt the Legend of Zelda. 


Stating he doesn&#x27;t believe this news to be a huge surprise, Sneider told The Hot Mic Podcast &quot;Zelda is looking like the next big Illumination x Nintendo franchise&quot;.

The skin is no longer available to buy in both Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone.


Nickmercs&#x27; comment was in response to a video shared by esports caster Chris Puckett in which pro-LGBT+ demonstrators were attacked outside of a school in California. &quot;Americans are in a sad place right now,&quot; said Puckett. &quot;Let people love who they love and live your own life.&quot;

As for the Lara Croft bean skin, it is taking inspiration from the classic Lara of old, complete with short shorts, tank top, dinky backpack and braided hair.

But those that stuck around post-Keighley were, as is fast becoming tradition, rewarded with another batch of intriguing indie titles, courtesy of this year&#x27;s Day of the Devs stream - and if you missed it, the whole thing can be perused in one convenient, easily digestible round-up below.

Beastieball

Beastieball is a new RPG from Wishes Unlimited, the studio behind the acclaimed Wondersong and Chicory. This time around, the team is turning its attention to what looks something like Pokémon with its combat replaced by a strategic, turn-based take on volleyball. It sees players, in the role of a coach, touring the world and signing up Beasties they encounter to join their team and take on rivals in bouts of Beastieball. Loads of Beasties are promised, and they can all form friendships that&#x27;ll create unique combos for use in matches. This one might still be a little way off, though - a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign launches soon.

                              <span>PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 cult action adventure Shadows of the Damned is getting a remaster, developer Grasshopper Manufacture has announced. 


More details on the project - and further reveals - will come next week in a dedicated Grasshopper Direct livestream. Yes, another one. 


If you missed Shadows of the Damned at the time, it&#x27;s a slightly silly demon shooter written by Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda, back from around the same time as Lollipop Chainsaw (a remaster of which was previously confirmed for launch this year).

                              <span>Amid the hubbub of the Summer Geoffs, Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have given a fresh look at Warhammer: Space Marine 2, showing of a slice of co-op campaign gameplay ahead of its arrival this &quot;winter&quot;.


Announced during last year&#x27;s The Game Awards, Space Marine 2 expands on the third-person shoot-and-slash template of the Relic Entertainment developed original, which released all the way back in 2011. It sees the return of the first game&#x27;s protagonist, Captain Titus (albeit with a new voice actor), and a new threat in the form of the Tyranids.


One of Space Marine 2&#x27;s big new features, not previously revealed, is the ability to play its main campaign either solo or in three-player co-op mode either with two friends of AI. And we&#x27;ve not been given a glimpse of that courtesy of its newly revealed Summer Game Fest trailer.

                              <span>Hello! The Summer Game Fest 2023 opening livestream has ended. The two hour show brought us a variety of new trailers for upcoming games, along with annoucements for ones which have already been released.
Don&#x27;t worry if you missed it, below you&#x27;ll find everything announced during the Summer Game Fest 2023 opening event, as it happened. (Be prepared - there&#x27;s quite a lot.)
It all began with a reveal for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown from Ubisoft, which will be released on 18th January 2024:

                              <span>Horror movie legend John Carpenter is teaming up with Saber Interactive for Toxic Commando, a co-op FPS promising &#x27;80&#x27;s vibes, action, humour, and horror&#x27; when it launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime next year.


Toxic Commando&#x27;s action unfolds somewhere in the &quot;near future&quot;, in a world where a failed experiment to harness the power of the Earth&#x27;s core has unleashed an Eldritch abomination known as the Sludge God, intent on &quot;turning soil to scum and the living to undead monsters&quot;.


Enter the Toxic Commandos, or, more specifically, up to four players, who&#x27;ll each need to select a class to suit their playstyle. From there, it&#x27;s a case of grabbing a weapon (firearms, grenades, even a katana), then tackling the mutant hordes on-foot or from behind the wheel of a vehicle.

Set to be broadcast on 29th June at 8pm UK time (3pm Eastern, 12pm Pacific) this showcase will reveal what&#x27;s next for the publisher of top indie games such as Outer Wilds and What Remains of Edith Finch.


Indeed, a sneaky teaser pointed to some of what we might expect, which you can watch below. The teaser concludes with a promise of &quot;one of our biggest announcements yet&quot;.

The game is so big, it will be on two discs and is a PlayStation 5 exclusive.


Square Enix has been teasing a reveal all week with developer comments of varying detail - today was day seven, resulting in the trailer below.

                              <span>As part of Summer Game Fest, we were given a fresh look at the upcoming Twisted Metal TV series. 


Will Arnett, who is voicing Sweet Tooth in this adaptation, introduced the new trailer, which sees Anthony Mackie squaring off with the series&#x27; clown-faced killer in an arcade. Actually, maybe those are slot machines. 


It&#x27;s all pretty awkward, if I am honest. Sweet Tooth pushes Mackie&#x27;s John Doe up against a cabinet and makes him sing along with him as the two share back and forth quips. But, it is what it is, as you can see for yourself below.

                              <span>Summer Games Fest 2023 just dropped the cinematic trailer for Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3: Wilds, which kicks off tomorrow.


The trailer is typically charming. The centre of the island has collapsed revealing a jungle. A bunch of heroes investigate an ancient temple, Fishstick does the Lara Croft emote roll, there are vines that are also grind rails and rideable velociraptor mounts. It&#x27;s basically everything you could want.


Then Optimus Prime turns up, things go wrong, and at the very end the big reveal is... Slone is back! SLONE IS BACK!

                              <span>Second Dinner&#x27;s chief development officer Ben Brode&#x27;s just taken the stage at Summer Game Fest to announce that Marvel Snap&#x27;s getting its &quot;biggest update ever&quot; next week, and it will contain a new mode.


Brode described Conquest mode as &quot;a great way to get a super competitive experience&quot;. The mode was announced recently, and seems to hinge on competing against the same opponent multiple times, draining their health with each win. It won&#x27;t replace the standard game mode, but will provide another option.


Marvel Snap&#x27;s a brilliant collectible card game for smartphones and PC. It&#x27;s got some genuinely brilliant cards in it and loads of fascinating design ideas. Do check it out.

Ahead of the reveal, Remedy&#x27;s Sam Lake shared some extra detail, including the game will feature two playable characters that players can swap between. The game is split evenly between both, with each narrative taking place in different worlds.


Lake also reiterated this is Remedy&#x27;s first survival horror. The gameplay footage features new character Saga, who appears to be living a narrative that Wake has written.

Ever Crisis is the remake of the original game for mobile platforms that was announced a few years back but is still yet to be released. Fans can sign up for a closed beta test on Android from 8th June - 29th June.


This isn&#x27;t just a remake, though. Not only does it feature new character models and flashy battles, it reimagines the whole Final Fantasy 7 saga - including Crisis Core - with extra narrative.

                              <span>Summer Games Fest is underway and Bandai Namco has just revealed a new third-person action game from Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball. It&#x27;s called Sand Land, and its based on Toriyama&#x27;s manga from 2000.


Sand Land&#x27;s set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply. When lawlessness breaks out over rising water costs, a sheriff approaches some local demons to strike a bargain.


What this means from the game&#x27;s reveal is an action game set in what looks like a large open world. Players explore in everything from hoverbikes to tanks and even on the backs of dinosaurs. There&#x27;s elaborate futuristic weaponry and fast third-person combat. It&#x27;s enlivened by lovely comic visual design and an art style that recalls things like Borderlands, with visible pen lines on characters and the landscape.

                              <span>If it&#x27;s weird crossovers you want, how about Street Fighter obots smashing against killer dinos? Because that&#x27;s what Capcom&#x27;s offering in its newly announced Exoprimal collaboration.


Exoprimal is, of course, Capcom&#x27;s new squad-based multiplayer shooter, in which teams of five, adorned in ridiculously over-the-top mech-style armour known as Exosuits, take on hordes of dinosaurs, from swarming raptors to marauding T. rexes.


And that&#x27;s where Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 collaboration comes in, with a bunch of familiar faces from the long-running franchise dropping into Exoprimal in the form of stylised Exosuits.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest has kicked off. Literally. 


Along with the newly announced Prince of Persia game, we were swiftly treated to a look at Mortal Kombat 1. This included gameplay, so expect plenty of blood and gore. I am talking about decapitations, saws to the face, spinal cord removal. You know, kind of what you&#x27;d expect from the famously brutal fighter series. 


Here is that trailer. Maybe put any food you were eating to one side before diving in.

                              <span>Gun Interactive has announced an end for Friday the 13th: The Game, confirming the asymmetrical multiplayer horror will be pulled from stores on 31st December this year, the same day its Friday the 13th licence officially expires.


Friday the 13th: The Game has been around since 2017, and, despite a rocky start, proved to be a solidly entertaining - and commercially successful - horror experience. Unfortunately, its development was forced to end prematurely in 2018 amid a lawsuit relating to the ownership of the Friday the 13th licence, and 2020 bought the news Gun would be decommissioning the game&#x27;s dedicated servers, reverting to the peer-to-peer networking favoured at launch.


Since then, with no new content in development, Friday the 13th: The Game has largely remained out of the spotlight, but, now, Gun has confirmed - in a statement shared on Twitter - the game&#x27;ll no longer be available to purchase, either digitally or physically, once its licence expires on 31st December 2023. There&#x27;s some small solace for owners, however, in that the developer says the game will remain playable through &quot;at least&quot; 31st December 2024.

Mobile device backups contain a partial copy of the filesystem, including some of the user data and service databases. The timestamps of the files, folders and the database records allow to roughly reconstruct the events happening to the device. The mvt-ios utility produces a sorted timeline of events into a file called “timeline.csv,” similar to a super-timeline used by conventional digital forensic tools.
Using this timeline, we were able to identify specific artifacts that indicate the compromise. This allowed to move the research forward, and to reconstruct the general infection sequence:...</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s the most wonderful time of the year. No, not the silly festive season but June, when all the big games companies come out to play and show us what they&#x27;ve got. And the centrepoint of it all will be today&#x27;s Opening Showcase of Summer Game Fest.
It begins at 8pm UK time (9pm CEST / 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT) and you can watch the stream here while we report live on what we see. I&#x27;m sure you know the drill by now, but this is a chance for us to follow the announcements together and talk about whether we&#x27;re impressed by them. Will we be?
What is on the cards for tonight, then - what should we expect? Well, Geoff Keighley, obviously, because it&#x27;s his show. But in terms of head-turning games: Ed Boon will be there to show Mortal Kombat 1, the franchise reboot, and Remedy&#x27;s Sam Lake will be there to show more of Alan Wake 2.

                              <span>Yesterday, legendary actress Whoopi Goldberg took to Instagram to blast Blizzard for not releasing Diablo 4 for Apple.

In a minute-long video, Goldberg explained how excited she was to play Diablo 4, which she called her &quot;favourite game&quot; series, on her Apple computer, which she called her &quot;favourite gaming system&quot;. 

&quot;I know there&#x27;s a lot of terrible things happening in the world, but what I&#x27;m about to tell you is not on any scale like that,&quot; Goldberg said. Indeed, it&#x27;s not quite as grim as seeing Diablo 4&#x27;s billboard advert against the backdrop of wildfires, or Activision Blizzard CCO Lulu Cheng Meservey assuring us the company has &quot;no affiliation or partnership&quot; with said natural disaster. But you know what they say - an Apple a day keeps the demons away. Or something like that.

                              <span>A lengthy list of details for upcoming Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name has leaked, presumably ahead of a formal announcement at one of this year&#x27;s not-E3 livestreams, or developer RGG Studio&#x27;s own showcase next week. 

Gaiden was first announced in September last year, when it was described as a more compact return to the action gameplay of previous games in the series. Plot-wise, the game will follow series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and explain what happened to him in the gap between Yakuza 6 and Like a Dragon 8.

Back in September, Gaiden was teased with a release date at some point this year. Now, it seems the game will launch in November, according to data scraped by website PS Deals (thanks, Gematsu).

That&#x27;s according to cryptic teases laid out by Ubisoft itself which have now been cracked by the series&#x27; enterprising community. 


Data strings written in binary programming language found on a promotional image for Nexus appear to correspond to the birth dates of three Assassin&#x27;s Creed characters.

Amongst the additions for Season 4 are new maps, new operators, and limited time launch modes.
Vondel, the recently-leaked new map, looks to be inspired by Amsterdam and its canal system. Players will be able to dive into the canals or drive across them to move around Vondel. In size, Vondel is somewhere between Al Mazrah and Ashika Island.

Known as Connecting Worlds, this documentary will provide us with a &quot;rare insight&quot; into Kojima&#x27;s creative process, with the likes of Norman Reedus - currently working with Kojima on Death Stranding&#x27;s sequel DS2 - and filmmaker Guillermo del Toro contributing to the upcoming production.


In a short trailer, which you can see below, Reedus likens working with Kojima to &quot;stepping into Willy Wonka&#x27;s Chocolate Factory with Willy Wonka&quot;.  Meanwhile, on screen text proclaims Kojima as being &quot;widely regarded as the first auteur of video games&quot;. From what I can tell, this documentary will cover Kojima&#x27;s experience founding Kojima Productions as well as his creative process.

                              <span>If the summer heat is getting to you, here is something that will cool you down a bit - Lake, the cosy postal game, is getting a wintery and festive DLC.


Appropriately titled Season&#x27;s Greetings, this DLC will act as a prequel taking place nine months before the main story of Lake. This time, players will take on the role of Thomas Weiss, father of Lake&#x27;s protagonist Meredith Weiss, as he goes about his days delivering mail to the residents of Providence Oaks, while readying himself for a visit from his daughter. 


Lake developer Gamious promises more of the same cosy and relaxing gameplay in Season&#x27;s Greetings, with the addition of new characters as well as some familiar faces. There will also be the chance to find answers to some of those lingering questions players still have from the main game - though the developer stopped short of spoiling any specifics. You can see a short trailer for Season&#x27;s Greetings below.

                              <span>World of Horror, the Junji-Ito-inspired roguelike RPG from developer Paweł Koźmiński, leaves PC early access on 19th October and releases for PlayStation and Switch on the same day.


World of Horror initially launched into PC early access a little over three years ago, and its deliciously nasty tale of a seaside town beseiged by malevolent cosmic forces - which players must investigate over the course of five randomly selected mysteries each playthrough - has slowly expanded with new stories, events, and features since then.


If you&#x27;ve not yet hopped onboard World of Horror&#x27;s early access, the whole thing plays out something like a 1-bit version of the board game Arkham Horror, albeit with Lovecraftian overtones traded for something closer to Junji Ito&#x27;s distinct brand of the mundane run amok - so think high school terror, haunted bulletin board systems, and so on.

As its name suggests, Dr. Fetus&#x27; Mean Meat Machine turns the spotlight on Super meat Boy villain Dr. Fetus who, this time around, is aiming to create the perfect clone of Meat Boy - a process requiring him to eliminate all the rubbish clones first.


And so enter the Mean Meat Machine, a terrifying contraption that sees malformed clones dropping in at the top and then falling en masse to the bottom, wending their way past an array of deadly devices as they go, including chainsaws, missiles, and lasers.

                              <span>ThroughLine Games, the studio behind the acclaimed Forgotton Anne, has unveiled Forgotlings, an equally gorgeous &quot;spiritual sequel&quot; that&#x27;s just launched a Kickstarter campaign.


Forgotlings, like its predecessor, takes place in a &quot;magical realm inhabited by things we have lost and forgotten&quot;, where sentient creatures - the Forgotlings - live in search of a purpose.


However, despite its shared universe, Forgotlings looks to be something of a new beginning in both story and gameplay terms. It casts players as Fig, a &quot;gifted posing doll&quot;, thrust into a world caught in a conflict between five mighty tribes. Fig will need to unite each tribe to save the world from destruction at the hands of an &quot;enigmatic Beast&quot;.

American approval, even if indirect, has been at the heart of Paragon’s strategy. The company sought a list of allied nations that the US wouldn’t object to seeing deploy Graphite.

                              <span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, the wonderful retro brawler from Tribute Games, is readying to expand its roster with a certain samurai rabbit later this year, come the release of its newly announced Dimension Shellshock DLC.


Dimension Shellshock promises to bring fans an &quot;all-new adventure&quot; introducing the Ninja Turtles&#x27; occasional ally Miyamoto Usagi, who originally made the jump from his own Usagi Yojimbo comicbook series into the turtles&#x27; world back in 1987.


Alongside its new playable character (the announcement trailer teases new playable &quot;characters&quot; but doesn&#x27;t elaborate further), Dimension Shellshock also includes a mysterious new game mode, alternative colour palette options, plus new music composed by Tee Lopes.

                              <span>The first major Counter-Strike 2 update has arrived since the game launched as a limited test in March, bringing with it a radical new loadout system, new buy mechanics and - finally! - a new map for testing purposes, Mirage. 
The loadout system has the potential to be the most disruptive change, as you can now choose five each of pistols, rifles and &quot;mid-tier&quot; (SMG/shotgun) weapons to take into a match. Previously, weapons like the silenced and unsilenced M4 were assigned to the same category, so you would have to go without one of them - but here, you could sacrifice one of the less-used rifles to have both options available. This change has been requested by players for a long time, and would also make it easier for developers Valve to add new weapons in the future, so it&#x27;s a big win in my book. 
When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first appeared more than a decade ago, it sported a radial buy menu designed to mesh nicely to gamepad controls - after all, the game was originally intended to buy a console-focused iteration of the franchise. That menu has been replaced in the new Counter-Strike 2 update, in favour of a simpler grid-based buy menu that shows your teammate&#x27;s purchases. Crucially, it&#x27;s now possible to refund unused weapons, armour and grenades before buy time expires at the start of each round, saving you from the ignoble fate of spending all your hard-earned cash on a weapon you bought accidentally - always a pain given the importance of Counter-Strike&#x27;s round-to-round economy system.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive is offering refunds to those who have pre-ordered Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, following multiple delays.


In an blog update today, the publisher acknowledged it had been a while since many pre-orders had been placed. Three years later, Bloodlines 2 still does not have a release date.


Paradox said it was still &quot;dedicated to delivering&quot; a great game, but that it was now updating its various editions and bonus content. &quot;With the bonus content being updated, the prior physical edition offered items that are no longer representative of the game,&quot; it explained. As such, the publisher said it was offering refunds in order to &quot;provide the best value&quot;.

Yet here we are. Winnie&#x27;s Hole, as it&#x27;s known, is an actual real video game you can wishlist on Steam.

                              <span>Two years after the launch of Monster Hunter Rise and a little under a year since the arrival of its mighty Sunbreak expansion, Capcom is ready to release its last-ever content update for Sunbreak players, bringing one final monster to Switch and Steam tomorrow, 8th June.


While elder dragon Amatsu was originally supposed to bring Sunbreak&#x27;s story to a close in April&#x27;s Ver. 15 update, Capcom says it decided to squeeze one last surprise in for players after it identified a few additional features it wanted to include.


As such, Sunbreak owners will face a final, formidable challenge when tomorrow&#x27;s free Title Update 6 (AKA Ver. 16) arrives, bringing the expansion&#x27;s story to a close with a battle against the Primordial Malzeno, revealing more on its relationship with the Kingdom. The fight - which features new moves compared to the original version of Malzeno - will be available to hunters at Master Rank 10 and above, and includes materials needed to craft new weapons and armour.

                              <span>Fntastic, the developer behind upcoming zombie MMO The Day Before, has addressed the rather unusual trademark dispute that led to the game being delayed.


As a quick reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release on PC back in March. However, in a bizarre series of events, it transpired that Fntastic had failed to trademark the game&#x27;s name, which had since been contested by the company behind a calendar app. All traces of the game were subsequently removed from Steam.


Talking to WellPlayed, Fntastic has now provided a small update on this trademark debacle, stating it believes &quot;power is in the truth&quot;.

Expeditions, for those unfamiliar with No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s ways, are something like Hello Games&#x27; stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim&#x27;s various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges with some nifty rewards.


Its latest expedition, Singularity, which launches today, continues the story started in April&#x27;s Interceptor update (the one with weird, corrupted worlds and strange Sentinel oddities), asking players to investigate curious robot heads delivering cryptic clues across the galaxy. Its events are said to be part of a longer narrative that&#x27;ll play out as the year goes on.

It&#x27;s interesting timing for a Payday 3 launch date to appear - just a day before Summer Games Fest 2023 kicks off in earnest with an announcement-filled livestream. Other events from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom are also set to follow in the coming days.

This may seem obvious - after all, our own planet is of course a sphere (sorry Flat Earthers) - but when so many games present a flat map, it&#x27;s easy to misinterpret.


Harrison Pink, senior quest designer on the game, shared this &quot;tiny lore nugget&quot; on Twitter.

                              <span>Twitch has apologised for updates made to its branded content policy which have upset streamers across the platform.


Yesterday, the company updated its Branded Content Guidelines that detail what is and isn&#x27;t allowed on the platform in terms of branded and sponsored streams, a major way streamers generate extra revenue.


The new rules were met with anger by large swathes of the streaming community, forcing Twitch to apologise and rewrite its guidelines.

                              <span>Amazon and Rovio have announced a new animated TV series based on the popular mobile game Angry Birds. 


Angry Birds: Mystery Island will follow the escapades of three new hatchlings - Mia, Rosie, and Buddy. There is also a new foreign-exchange piglet, and his name is the rather brilliant Hamylton. 


According to a press release, these four &quot;rambunctious tweens&quot; receive an all expenses paid island getaway, but of course things are not going to go to plan. Rather than landing where they intended, they instead get unceremoniously catapulted onto an &quot;uncharted island&quot; (where I assume they will meet Nathan Drake).

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has apologised for a &quot;technical issue&quot; discovered by players this week which affected the odds of encountering the game&#x27;s much-coveted Shiny Pokémon when battling bosses using a Remote Raid Pass. 

Niantic will now return any Remote Raid Pass used on these bosses, and hold an additional &quot;special event&quot; to make up for the error.
Remote Raid Passes were recently nerfed by Niantic to make them less attractive for players to use, with a limit on the number of times they can be used per day and a more expensive price tag. The discovery that Remote Raid Passes were giving lower-than-expected Shiny odds left fans wondering whether this was yet another change by Niantic.

                              <span>EA has confirmed reports it&#x27;s in talks to move the development of BioWare&#x27;s long-running free-to-play MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic to a third-party so the studio can focus on its upcoming new Mass Effect and Dragon Age instalments.


News of EA&#x27;s plans were first reported by IGN, who claimed the publisher was currently considering shifting The Old Republic&#x27;s development to Broadsword Online Games, a company run by former BioWare vice president and Mythic Entertainment co-founder Rob Denton, who previously worked on the Star Wars title in its early days.


Broadsword is no stranger to MMOs, of course - its other projects include ongoing work on Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot - and IGN reported EA had already signed a letter of intent with the studio, which would see The Old Republic deal finalised &quot;as soon as this month&quot;.

The big news this time around is that the Forgotten Lands&#x27; mysterious pumpkin house, which has sat vacant amid gloomy woods since launch, will finally have an occupant as part of what Gameloft is calling Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s &quot;biggest story update yet&quot;.


To the surprise of no-one with at least a passing interest in Disney, its new occupant will be Cinderella&#x27;s Fairy Godmother - who comes complete with her own set of Friendship Quests - with her arrival seemingly signalling a conclusion for Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s first major story arc.

Planet Zoo&#x27;s Arid Animal Pack marks the game&#x27;s 15th DLC expansion since its launch at the end of 2019, and - as with all Animal Packs - is predominantly focused on expanding the game&#x27;s wildlife roster, this time with eight new creature additions.


Purchasers get access to the single-humped dromedary camel, the African crested porcupine, the black rhino, the addax (today I learned what an addax is!), the Somali wild ass, the sand cat, the dama gazelle, and the desert horned viper, which appears as an exhibit animal.

Career Rank is described as a &quot;larger progression system&quot; that reflects players&#x27; time across the entirety of Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer modes, and is said to be similar to the progression systems found in Halo: Reach and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.


According to 343, Career Rank is tied to a player&#x27;s Personal Score, meaning that while all multiplayer matches will help players rank up, better match performance means faster progress through its various tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Onyx.

                              <span>I originally had a throwaway joke on Twitter that became an article: 17 Ways to Run Containers on AWS. That was all well and good, and because I don&#x27;t know when to leave well enough alone, a few months later I wrote 17 More Ways to Run Containers on AWS. And now, since I don&#x27;t know when to leave well enough alone and stop beating the greasy smear on the sidewalk where the horse used to be, I want to introduce the third article in this series.
The post 17 Final Ways to Run Containers appeared first on Last Week in AWS.</span>

                              <span>New paper: “Lessons Lost: Incident Response in the Age of Cyber Insurance and Breach Attorneys“:
Abstract: Incident Response (IR) allows victim firms to detect, contain, and recover from security incidents. It should also help the wider community avoid similar attacks in the future. In pursuit of these goals, technical practitioners are increasingly influenced by stakeholders like cyber insurers and lawyers. This paper explores these impacts via a multi-stage, mixed methods research design that involved 69 expert interviews, data on commercial relationships, and an online validation workshop. The first stage of our study established 11 stylized facts that describe how cyber insurance sends work to a small numbers of IR firms, drives down the fee paid, and appoints lawyers to direct technical investigators. The second stage showed that lawyers when directing incident response often: introduce legalistic contractual and communication steps that slow-down incident response; advise IR practitioners not to write down remediation steps or to produce formal reports; and restrict access to any documents produced...</span>

                              <span>Blizzard seems pretty chuffed with the response to Diablo 4, and is now trumpeting the fact that, not only have players cumulatively already racked up over 10,000 years of play time, Diablo 4 is also the company&#x27;s &quot;fastest-selling game of all time&quot;.


Blizzard is calculating those impressive-sounding play time figures based on the number of in-game hours players have accrued since 1st June, the date when Diablo 4 entered &quot;early access&quot; for those willing to pay extra for the privilege.


The company reckons over 93m hours of Diablo 4 have been played across the first four days, equating to over 10,000 years (actually more like 10,616 hours according to my calculator, but who am I to quibble maths?) - or, as Blizzard puts it, the equivalent of one person &quot;playing 24 hours a day since the beginning of human civilisation&quot;.

The pair, as well as returning protagonists Rebecca Chambers, Chris and Claire Redfield, are brought together when investigating a number of bioweapon-related cases.

The fine is in response to the collection of personal information from children via Xbox without parents being notified or giving consent, as well as the illegal retention of that information, the FTC has said.



As a result, Microsoft is required to make a number of changes to improve privacy protection for children on Xbox.

The livestream will run for &quot;roughly 36 minutes&quot;, Capcom has said, and features &quot;news and updates on our latest games&quot;. 


No specific titles are mentioned, but it seems likely we&#x27;ll see more of dinosaur shooting game Exoprimal (which is out next month) and perhaps a bit of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 (which we got a glimpse of last month at Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase).

Kojima broke the news during Apple&#x27;s WWDC 2023 keynote presentation, beaming onto Apple&#x27;s expansive digital set to express his enthusiasm for the company&#x27;s products. &quot;I have been a die-hard Apple fan since I bought my first Mac back in 1994,&quot; Kojima explained. &quot;It has been a dream of mine to see my team&#x27;s best work come to life on the Mac.&quot;


To that end, Kojima said his studio&#x27;s support for Mac would begin &quot;later this year&quot;, with the launch of its expanded package-delivery-in-a-damp-valley extravaganza, Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut. &quot;This is just the beginning,&quot; Kojima added, &quot;and we are actively working to bring our future titles to Apple platforms&quot;.

                              <span>With just days to go until the launch of Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 4 Season 3 on 9th June, Epic is steadily ramping up its teases for some of the things the new season will bring, including the apparent confirmation of a previously rumoured new jungle biome.


Word that Epic might be preparing to bring a jungle biome to the latest iteration of Fortnite&#x27;s map first came via leakers back in April. And a couple of recent official social media asset updates - including some art of a city bordered by vines - lent further credence to those reports.


But now, thanks to a new 8-second teaser shared on the official Fortnite Twitter feed, a jungle biome is a good as confirmed. Peer closely betwixt the lettering and a brisk flyover awaits, skiming over raging waters and lush, mist-shrouded tropical foliage before the camera comes to a halt in view of some squat stone ruins perched atop a cliffside.

                              <span>After years of rumour and speculation, Apple has unveiled its long-in-the-works augmented reality headset, Vision Pro, which is due to release &quot;early next year&quot; for $3,499 USD.


Vision Pro - which Apple is insisting on referring to as a &quot;spatial computer&quot; - is designed around the idea of staying &quot;present and connected to others&quot;, whether at home or at work. Which, in more practical terms, means its entire 3D interface is built around experiencing apps and other media directly within a user&#x27;s immediate environment, as viewed through its internal display.


Apps can been relocated and resized in the physical space using Apple&#x27;s new VisionOS 3D interface, which is primarily controlled through a mix of voice commands, eye tracking, and hand tracking - although traditional keyboards and trackpads are compatible.

                              <span>Extensive gameplay of Ubisoft&#x27;s open-world racer The Crew Motorfest has appeared online just a week ahead of its planned appearance at the publisher&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase.


Ubisoft unveiled The Crew Motorfest for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC back in January with a 49-second trailer featuring a handful of &quot;in-engine&quot; cinematics. It&#x27;s a live-service game themed around a &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; motoring festival, promising &quot;tailor-made races, themed events, and other unique challenges&quot;, all taking place on the scenic Hawaiian island of O&#x27;ahu.


Since that official announcement, Ubisoft has hosted several &quot;insider programme&quot; closed testing sessions for registered players, with the fourth phase currently underway. It&#x27;s this latest closed test that appears to have generated the spate of new gameplay videos Ubisoft is currently playing copyright-strike whack-a-mole with online.

I wrote the essay below in September 2013. The New Yorker agreed to publish it, but the Guardian asked me not to. It was scared of UK law enforcement, and worried that this essay would reflect badly on it. And given that the UK police would raid its offices in July 2014, it had legitimate cause to be worried.
Now, ten years later, I offer this as a time capsule of what those early months of Snowden were like...</span>

                              <span>Capcom has been hitting it out of the park recently with its Resident Evil remakes, but what would it look like if the publisher decided to take its games in the opposite direction?

Well, you don&#x27;t have to wonder any longer, thanks to a group of modders creating a Resident Evil 0 demake. The game was originally released in 2002 for the GameCube, and looks and plays similar to the HD Resident Evil remaster.

This demake for 0 does the opposite, however, and turns the game into a Resident Evil experience like that of the first three games on PlayStation 1. Footage of the project in action can be seen below, via El Rincon del Lobezno&#x27;s YouTube channel, who is one of the modders involved in its creation.

                              <span>Square Enix has confirmed it has &quot;made preparations&quot; to ensure Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth can still be enjoyed by those who missed the first game.


Beginning at the end of last week, Square Enix has issued fresh comments on the game each day - thankfully remembering the project still exists, after nearly a year of no news.



The first comment confirmed a release date was being considered, while subsequent comments have noted that the game will have a &quot;multifaceted world with a high degree of freedom&quot; - which some fans are interpreting to mean &quot;open world&quot;. Lastly, Square Enix has  clarified that yes, this game will in fact contain a story and characters. Who&#x27;d have thought?

First launched in early access back in 2017, Dead Cells is now available for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation and Xbox, as well as on smartphone for iOS and Android.


It also remains regularly updated - and today, we heard word that Dead Cells would continue getting further updates for at least another two years, until 2025. Gosh, that sounds like the future!

                              <span>The first player to hit level 100 in Diablo 4&#x27;s hardcore mode is streamer cArn_.


The streamer made the announcement on Twitter and has a Twitch clip of the moment in question, which Diablo community manager PezRadar has responded to in congratulations (thanks GamesRadar).


Ahead of the game&#x27;s early release on Friday, Blizzard announced a &quot;race event&quot; where the first 1000 players to reach level 100 on hardcore difficulty will be &quot;immortalised on a statue of Lilith&quot;. Now we know the first.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a sequel to 2017&#x27;s Breath of the Wild, and even before the game was released we knew some time had passed between the two. 


How much time? That remains something of a mystery - and something Nintendo itself has shied away from providing any official timeline for.


However, I - and other fans - think we may have sussed it. Please note, there are some minor Tears of the Kingdom spoilers below.

Phantom Blade Zero was officially announced a couple of weeks ago at Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase, where it gained attention for its slick wuxia-influenced combat and Souls-esque vibes.

The plot follows Soul, an elite assassin for an organisation known as The Order, as he attempts to track the person who framed him for killing the The Order&#x27;s patriarch on limited time. S-Game made the comments on what players can expect in its Discord server through a series of developer Q&amp;As.

When fans on Resetera noted the footage wasn&#x27;t in the recent PlayStation Showcase trailer, Stevenson replied: &quot;It is new&quot;.

The newest of these discoveries are two unused paraglider fabrics, found by dataminers.

Fabrics can be taken to the dye shop in Hateno Village, where you can customise your glider with different designs. While some fabrics can be gained by completing side quests, others are (annoyingly) locked behind scanning Amiibo.

Sony will study &quot;various options&quot; around streaming games, even using its AI agent GT Sophy to enhance cloud gaming, said Yoshida in an interview with the Financial Times.


&quot;I think cloud itself is an amazing business model, but when it comes to games, the technical difficulties are high,&quot; said Yoshida. &quot;So there will be challenges to cloud gaming, but we want to take on those challenges.&quot;

Responding to Xbox fans via Twitter, Greenberg said that &quot;none of our first-party games in the show are full CG trailers&quot;. There will also be &quot;no movie or TV show trailers in our games show,&quot; he added.


Sony was criticised by some fans for using CG footage in its recent PlayStation Showcase. That event also included a trailer for Sony&#x27;s upcoming Gran Turismo movie.

                              <span>Developers are starting to talk about the software-defined car.
For decades, features have accumulated like cruft in new vehicles: a box here to control the antilock brakes, a module there to run the cruise control radar, and so on. Now engineers and designers are rationalizing the way they go about building new models, taking advantage of much more powerful hardware to consolidate all those discrete functions into a small number of domain controllers.
The behavior of new cars is increasingly defined by software, too. This is merely the progression of a trend that began at the end of the 1970s with the introduction of the first electronic engine control units; today, code controls a car’s engine and transmission (or its electric motors and battery pack), the steering, brakes, suspension, interior and exterior lighting, and more, depending on how new (and how expensive) it is. And those systems are being leveraged for convenience or safety features like adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, remote parking, and so on...</span>

Ascension was one of the more mysterious projects announced alongside the news that Bloober Team was remaking Silent Hill 2, and there&#x27;s not been much else said about it since, despite the release date originally pointing to early 2023.

Now, however, we&#x27;ve got an &quot;official trailer&quot; – which is more than we had last time – and confirmation that it&#x27;s still on track to release at some point later this year.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly considering withdrawing Activision from the UK in a bid to bypass the country&#x27;s merger block.

According to a new Bloomberg (£) and spotted by VGC, Microsoft president Brad Smith plans to meet UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to discuss firsthand the company&#x27;s frustration at the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) decision to block the $69bn acquisition.

Though in the UK for a talk about regulating AI, Smith also hopes to hold private discussions with the Chancellor, including, according to a spokesperson, &quot;the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard as we remain committed to finding creative and constructive ways to address remaining regulatory concerns&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft has allegedly stepped in and deleted an Xbox achievement after players complained that it was unobtainable.

Casual farming sim Homestead Arcana came to Xbox Game Pass in April, complete with the usual 30+ achievements that reward working your way through the game&#x27;s story and various activities.

However, it didn&#x27;t take long for players to realise that one of the achievements – called &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Too Prepared&quot; – was proving difficult to complete, as it requires players to craft every item in the game at least once.

In a new survey circulated to Resident Evil fans, Capcom first polls your thoughts on its social media channels and gauges how much you use and appreciate its community efforts. 

But right at the end, once you&#x27;ve fed back on its various channels and websites, it asks two more questions: &quot;Please let us know any opinions/comments you may have about the activities on the various [Resident Evil websites]&quot; and &quot;Let us know if there are any other Resident Evil games you want remade&quot;.
