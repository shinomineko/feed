                              <span>In a scheme that can only be matched by Team Star in its levels of nefariousness, players have found an exploit in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that lets you skip the game&#x27;s first quest.
The intended sequence of the game would see you play through The First Day of School quest, which would then unlock all the other storylines in the game.
However, players have found a way to skip the latter section of the quest, allowing you to cut out the tedium of meeting your new classmates and teachers and get straight into exploring the open-world of Paldea.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s World Cup is a little different, as I think we all understand. Amidst headlines on migrant worker conditions, LGBTQ+ rights and criticism of the tournament from both players and fans, it&#x27;s been interesting to see how brands - and video games - are noting Qatar 2022.


Fortnite has a history with football - and its governing bodies. Some of its most popular skins are based on football kit designs, and the game&#x27;s meme-like dances were a fixture of England&#x27;s 2018 World Cup squad. Last year, Epic Games officially licensed the likenesses of England&#x27;s Harry Kane and Germany&#x27;s Marco Reus for the delayed 2020 Euros, and featured an in-game &quot;UEFA Euro 2020 Cup&quot; tournament with cash prizes. 


Prior to that, Fortnite has added skins wearing the officially-licensed football shirts of 23 top teams worldwide, including many from the Premiership. Fortnite also has an officially licensed Neymar Jr. skin, and an emote where you can punch the air that was launched in a collaboration with Pelé.

To put this figure into perspective, Warzone 1 reached 30 million players in 10 days. If Warzone 2 keeps up the same momentum, it is safe to assume it will soon exceed these figures.


Activision shared the news of this milestone on its social media feeds, thanking those who have taken part in its frenzied battlegrounds so far.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to the days of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and you may recall an infamous bug that allowed players to soar through the skies in a fashion that should not be not humanly possible. This became known as the &#x27;Superman&#x27; exploit, due to the way the players looked when this glitch was in motion - positioned horizontally in a skydiving position.


And now, when playing Call of Duty&#x27;s most recent offerings of Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, you may well see this move in play once more. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it&#x27;s just your teammate channelling their inner Clark Kent. 


Today&#x27;s version of the Superman exploit was recently shared by prolific Warzone 2 player Wuqi. In a compilation, the gamer can be seen bouncing off certain points on the maps while diving in the air, giving them a soaring boost. This, as you can see below, allows them to cover ground a lot more quickly than the more traditional methods of traversal.

Originally planned for autumn, the update was delayed in September for more development time, with a release window of the holiday season.

So far, Nintendo has stated the update will support local and online play. 21 holes from Wii Sports will be included. Online play will support up to eight players in survival golf, where the player with the most strokes will be knocked out.

                              <span>The publisher of role-playing game Ys 8: Lacrimosa of Dana is currently investigating why the game has been removed from Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue without warning. 


Sony&#x27;s subscription service offered the PS4 version of Ys 8, alongside other titles in the series. Last week, a £35 PS5 version of the game launched, with no free upgrade option for fans with a PS4 copy already. 


It was around this time that the RPG&#x27;s PS4 version disappeared from the PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue.

                              <span>18 months after Ubisoft announced plans to bring crossplay and cross-progression to Rainbow Six Siege, their long-awaited console launch is finally almost here, with a release now set for 6th December as part of Year 7&#x27;s final season, Operation Solar Raid.


Crossplay and cross-progression have, of course, been available in Rainbow Six Siege for some time now, but only between PC, Stadia, and Luna. As of next month, though, that&#x27;ll open out to incorporate PlayStation and Xbox, so console owners can take advantage of the features too.


From 6th December, console players can access their progress, currencies, and other items across all platforms simply by logging into their accounts. They can also team up with friends on other consoles via Ubisoft Connect, although it&#x27;s possible to opt out of crossplay if preferred.

                              <span>Following the launch of MultiVersus&#x27; second season last week, the free-to-play fighter&#x27;s roster has now expanded once more, this time ushering in Looney Tunes&#x27; extraterrestrial extraordinaire Marvin the Martian.


Marvin&#x27;s imminent arrival was teased last week as Season 2 got underway, but he officially joins the line-up today, bringing Multiversus&#x27; total number of playable fighters up to 23 - with Marvin joining recent additions such as Black Adam and Gremlins&#x27; Gizmo and Stripe.


Marvin can be unlocked with 3000 Gold, 1 Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium, and features three signature moves. There&#x27;s his B-23 Bubble Blaster, giving players the power to launch bubble projectiles, and that&#x27;s joined by his K-62 Projectile Modulator - basically a big red button that will reverse the direction of allied projectiles. Finally, Marvin can plant his flag into the ground, simultaneously claiming it for Mars and sending enemies skyward.

                              <span>As intense government scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard continues, with many regulatory bodies placing particular importance on the future of the Call of Duty franchise, Microsoft has told the New York Times it offered Sony a 10-year deal to keep the series on PlayStation earlier this month.


In total, 16 regulatory bodies around the world have launched investigations into Microsoft&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard to assess its likely impact on competition. So far, only Brazil and Saudi Arabia have approved the deal, with a number of territories, including the European Commission and the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, having announced more in-depth reviews of the matter.


In both those cases, Call of Duty&#x27;s future has been highlighted as a particular concern, with regulators raising fears the juggernaut franchise may be leveraged by Microsoft to gain an unfair advantage over its competition.

                              <span>EA has delayed its promised fix for excessive autonomous meanness in The Sims 4, meaning players are now going to have to put up with their Sims spontaneously picking fights and ruining each others lives until early December.


All this started back in October when, following a patch update, The Sims 4 players began reporting their Sims were autonomously insulting friends, relatives, and passersby at an alarming frequency, causing havoc to their carefully curated stories.


Eventually, with insults continuing to fly and households lying in ruin, EA moved to acknowledge the issue, promising a fix would arrive as soon as its investigation was complete.

Valhalla will be joined by other Ubisoft titles such as city-building strategy Anno 1800 and free-to-play 3v3 sports game Roller Champions.


The confirmation means Ubisoft is the latest publisher to make its return to Steam after striking out on its own - or elsewhere, such as the rival Epic Games Store.

                              <span>Footage of a prototype for Wumpa League, the long-rumoured multiplayer brawler set in the Crash Bandicoot universe, has been leaked online.

Rumours of the game&#x27;s existence began in summer, when it was accidentally let slip by Windows Central. Speculation on a new Crash Bandicoot game increased when Toys for Bob teased their 18th game, and fans are expecting to see a new entry in the series announced at The Game Awards next month.

The prototype was leaked yesterday by YouTuber Liam Robertson, for reasons he described as &quot;historical interest&quot;. A short snippet of gameplay is shown along with concept arts. Robertson reiterated throughout the video that the footage shown comes from a very early version of the project, and that it is &quot;not representative of what the game could look like if it releases&quot;.

                              <span>A former intern at Sony Santa Monica has said that their work on God of War Ragnarök had gone uncredited.


Sharing her story on Twitter, composer Jessica Mao stated she &quot;worked on the editing/arrangement/implementation of the Freya chase scene&quot; as well as the &quot;Thor boss fight music&quot;.


However, despite her input, Mao said her name was not included in the game&#x27;s end credits as her contribution to Ragnarök didn&#x27;t hit the &quot;minimum criteria&quot;  required (although Mao is unsure what &quot;this criteria could be&quot;).

                              <span>Nintendo has detailed Mario Kart Deluxe&#x27;s third wave of extra DLC tracks, which are now confirmed to release on 7th December. 


Included in the line-up is stone cold classic course Maple Treeway from Mario Kart Wii, which sees you zooming around the autumnal branches of a giant tree, through leaf piles and around Wiggler caterpillars. 


The top-tier Rainbow Road from Mario Kart DS is another notable addition here, alongside that game&#x27;s popular Peach Gardens.

Attendees will also have access to mysterious &quot;special Pokémon encounters&quot; in the wild and earn a commemorative in-game badge, all before the Ultra Beasts themselves emerge between 6pm and 7.30pm.

From tomorrow (22nd November), Fall Guys fans will be presented with five new rounds to get to grips with. These are Blastlantis, Hoop Chute, Puzzle Path, Speed Slider and Kraken Slam.


Blastlantis will task your anatomic beans with navigating a variety of &quot;tilting pathways&quot;. This will be made even harder thanks to the Blast Balls that will be, erm, blasted at them as they try to negotiate the path in front of them.

                              <span>This weekend&#x27;s big releases were Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and the internet has done a lot of talking about them. For reasons.
The game&#x27;s current state is far from perfect, leading to plenty of glitches, jankiness and sometimes full on Bethesda-level comedy horror.
Personally, I picked up the game precisely for that experience (I am having fun playing the game also!) but sadly I&#x27;ve not encountered anything funkier than a T-pose during my time with Violet so far. Luckily for me, there are countless other people who&#x27;ve been sharing their witness accounts on Twitter.

                              <span>Since its release just shy of two weeks ago, there has been a lot of chatter about God of War Ragnarök. This has ranged from whether or not there should be a PETA friendly mode included in the game, to Kratos&#x27; atonement for his past behaviour.


One thing that has really struck a chord is the amount of help Ragnarök&#x27;s companions give when players are trying to solve puzzles. Many fans feel that, really, it would be better if said companions just held on to their advice for that little bit longer than they ultimately choose to. 


For example, much like many others, I like to venture off the game&#x27;s main path every so often to see if there are any treasures tucked away I could miss if I left the area too soon. (This is all just standard exploration, not a sign that I don&#x27;t have a clue what I am doing. Honestly, it is.) Early on in the game I took one step away from Atreus and was swiftly told I was going the wrong way. &quot;I think this wheel over here needs to turn,&quot; he called after my retreating footsteps.

&quot;I didn&#x27;t think it was unexpected at all, but it seems that the ending of Bayo 3 wasn&#x27;t conveyed correctly to everyone, so I think Bayo 4 will be an unexpected development for everyone,&quot; Kamiya said via Twitter. &quot;After all, when Bayo 4 comes out, I&#x27;m sure there will be people who say, &#x27;You added that as an afterthought&#x27;, so I&#x27;ll say it now.&quot;

Boon, who loves to tease fans via Twitter, wrote over the weekend that his next game would either be &quot;I3 or MK12&quot; - Injustice 3 or Mortal Kombat 12.


Responding to a fan who asked why so few characters from the franchise&#x27;s less-popular 3D-era are seen in recent games, Boon stated: &quot;That is something we will soon fix.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has issued copyright strikes against SteamGridDB for images relating to its Switch games.



The site allows users to upload custom images for use in their Steam library. Most of these are alternate cover images to customise a game&#x27;s appearance in the library, but it&#x27;s also used when a cover image doesn&#x27;t exist - typically when playing games through an emulator.


This is why Switch game images have appeared on the site, which has since received a DMCA takedown notice, Games Radar reported.

                              <span>The all-digital Xbox Series S is currently the best console deal in the UK thanks to Black Friday deals. 
As spotted by our pals over at Digital Foundry, both Amazon and Smyths are selling the Series S for £189.99, nearly a quarter off its usual price of £249.99.
Compared to current-gen consoles and Nintendo Switch, that&#x27;s quite a steal.

                              <span>Impressive physical sales in the UK have made Pokémon Scarlet and Violet the biggest boxed video game launch of the year. Previously, this accolade was held by FIFA 23.


This has also won Scarlet and Violet the title of being the UK&#x27;s second biggest boxed Pokémon launch of all time. The biggest is still that of the 3DS&#x27;s Sun and Moon (although, due to sale prices, charts firm GfK states Scarlet and Violet has generated more money than Sun and Moon did during its launch week). 


Per GamesIndustry.biz, the first week of sales for Scarlet and Violet (at least physically, as Nintendo does not share digital sales) are 25 percent bigger than those of Sword and Shield, 70 percent bigger than the Diamond and Pearl remakes and 56 percent bigger than this year&#x27;s other big Pokémon offering, Arceus.

                              <span>Sony and Honda are joining forces on new electric vehicles that could incorporate PlayStation 5 consoles.


Sony Honda Mobility was established in September and plans to build electric vehicles with entertainment like music, movies, and the PlayStation 5 in mind.


&quot;Sony has content, services and entertainment technologies that move people. We are adapting these assets to mobility, and this is our strength against Tesla,&quot; president Izumi Kawanishi told the Financial Times (thanks TheGamer).

                              <span>Remember the codename Nintendo &quot;NX&quot;? Before the Switch&#x27;s official unveiling, these two letters were how Nintendo referred to its NeXt-generation console.


The NX name was used by Nintendo to refer to the Switch both internally and publicly, as the company began to drum up excitement for the Switch&#x27;s unveiling. (And because in the Wii U era, there wasn&#x27;t much else to get excited about.)


But here&#x27;s one thing we never saw publicly: Nintendo&#x27;s own internal NX logo used in early versions of games destined for the Switch.

                              <span>A cutscene wrapping up Destiny 2&#x27;s current Season of Plunder has been found by fans and shared online, spoiling the end of the game&#x27;s current plotline. 


If you wish to remain unspoiled - the season is still set to run for another few weeks, until 6th December - then look away now. 


The cutscene, voiced by Saint-14, shows Fallen leader Mithrax converting the essence of dead baddie Nezarec into a potion, which is then brewed up and served like a cup of tea.

                              <span>Brian Krebs writes about how the Zeppelin ransomware encryption scheme was broken:
The researchers said their break came when they understood that while Zeppelin used three different types of encryption keys to encrypt files, they could undo the whole scheme by factoring or computing just one of them: An ephemeral RSA-512 public key that is randomly generated on each machine it infects.
“If we can recover the RSA-512 Public Key from the registry, we can crack it and get the 256-bit AES Key that encrypts the files!” they wrote. “The challenge was that they delete the [public key] once the files are fully encrypted. Memory analysis gave us about a 5-minute window after files were encrypted to retrieve this public key.”...</span>

Developed by Tomohiro Nishikado, the game has been cited as revolutionising the arcade industry as well as having an influence on many famous video game designs since.

                              <span>Blizzard has begun deploying audio transcription to help combat abuse and toxicity in Overwatch 2&#x27;s voice chat.

Rolling out across &quot;select countries&quot; and currently only for those playing on PC, Blizzard says the new tech is &quot;only for reports of disruptive behaviour&quot; and any &quot;temporary audio recordings&quot; - which &quot;no one listens to&quot; - will be &quot;quickly deleted after being transcribed&quot;.

&quot;The audio transcription feature has been added with a limited rollout for PC players in select countries,&quot; Blizzard explained via a blog post. &quot;As a piece of our Defense Matrix initiative, audio transcriptions allow us to analyse a transcript from a temporary voice chat recording of a reported player.

Korean website Ruliweb reports that Fumihiko Yasuda confirmed plans to resurrect the two dormant franchises at a panel at the G-Star Conference earlier this week (thanks, VGC).

Whilst Yasuda stopped short of giving any concrete details, he reportedly said that whilst he couldn&#x27;t tell us any more right now, he hopes to deliver news we&#x27;d like to see &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.

                              <span>A new Warzone 2.0 bug is seemingly making some players invisible.

This latest glitch - which some may remember also briefly caused havoc in the original Warzone game - came to light over the weekend after players took to Reddit and social media with clips of them being taken out by players they cannot see. Literally.

Whilst its unknown how widespread the issue is, videos posted to social media show plenty have been on the receiving end of the frustrating glitch and it&#x27;s currently unclear if it&#x27;s just a random occurrence or something sneaky players can turn on and off at will (thanks, PCGN).

                              <span>A new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet mod removes all traces of Ed Sheeran from the game.

As spotted by GamesRadar+, the newly released mod - simply called &quot;Remove Sheeran&quot; - does exactly what it says on the tin, deleting Sheeran&#x27;s tracks from the credits and replacing it with a track from the late notable Japanese singer, Wada Koji.

&quot;Removes Ed Sheeran from the game and replaces him with Wada Koji (may he rest in peace),&quot; explains the mod&#x27;s creator, before adding that as they only own Violet, the mod has yet to be tested on Scarlet. It should still work, though.

As detailed on the developer&#x27;s social media channels, it seems as though Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 players on Xbox are experiencing lengthy queues whilst matchmaking if there are more than three people in a party.

&quot;We&#x27;re investigating an issue where some Xbox players in a party of more than three are having issues queuing up/matchmaking,&quot; the developed tweeted earlier today. &quot;Stay tuned for further updates.&quot;

                              <span>Warzone 2.0 players have discovered a bug that&#x27;s reportedly locking them out of the free-to-play game unless they own Modern Warfare 2.

Whilst the issue was posted on the game&#x27;s subreddit community earlier this week and seems to have been resolved for some, others are still adding to - and upvoting - the post, suggesting that it&#x27;s yet to be resolved. At the time of writing, there&#x27;s been no formal word from Infinity Ward or Raven Software, either.

&quot;Since yesterday, I played probably around six Warzone 2.0 matches with no problem,&quot; commented u/Unf0cused (thanks, NME).

                              <span>Striking Distance and publisher Krafton have unveiled a new teaser for its upcoming horror, The Callisto Protocol.

Imaginatively entitled &quot;official launch trailer UK&quot;, it packs a lot of action into just under two minutes of footage, most of which we&#x27;ve seen before, but some that will be new to those who have been tracking the game&#x27;s development. You can watch every slimy, gory second of it below:

The trailer also features the exclusive song Lost Again by Kings Elliot and confirms that the penultimate episode of the game&#x27;s six-part audio series, The Callisto Protocol: Helix Station, is also now available, along with the final part of the Engineering Horror docuseries, too.

&quot;Today, players can experience an extended look, offering even more detail on the decisions they will be called to make as they lead their forces throughout the course of World War 1, in a conflict which will force them to fight for every inch as they seek to relive history, or redefine it,&quot; the development team tells us.

                              <span>Warzone players have taken to Reddit to complain that the battle royale currently prohibits players from rejoining matches when they get disconnected.

As highlighted by u/AHappyPandaBear - and upvoted hundreds of times - players point out that although Apex Legends and PUBG Battlegrounds permit players to return mid-game following crashes or internet issues, Warzone does not, making it &quot;a massive L&quot; for the community.

The issue is particularly troublesome for DMZ players, who say they are losing &quot;so much&quot; loot and contraband without the chance to rejoin the session.

As spotted by Gematsu, the rating request submitted to the board and published yesterday includes a brief summary of the game (in Korean, naturally) and a 12+ age rating. 

According to Google Translate, Tears of the Kingdom has been described as a &quot;role-playing game for Nintendo Switch in which the stage of the adventure to find Zelda expands into the sky&quot;.

Whilst developer Ubisoft acknowledged that the &quot;news will come as a disappointment&quot; to some players, because of Valhalla&#x27;s &quot;very different structure from its predecessors&quot;, the open-world Viking game will be the first Assassin&#x27;s Creed game not to feature an option to boot up a New Game+ run.

&quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla has been built as a unique Assassin’s Creed experience, one that is very different from its predecessors in its structure, offering new ways of engaging with the world and its characters,&quot; Ubisoft explained in a blog post (thanks, GamesRadar+).

Researchers from the FAS Center for Systems Biology describe how they used a new live-imaging technique to watch neurons being created in the embryo in almost real-time. They were then able to track those cells through the development of the nervous system in the retina. What they saw surprised them.
The neural stem cells they tracked behaved eerily similar to the way these cells behave in vertebrates during the development of their nervous system.
It suggests that vertebrates and cephalopods, despite diverging from each other 500 million years ago, not only are using similar mechanisms to make their big brains but that this process and the way the cells act, divide, and are shaped may essentially layout the blueprint required develop this kind of nervous system...</span>

                              <span>Kirkus reviews A Hacker’s Mind:
A cybersecurity expert examines how the powerful game whatever system is put before them, leaving it to others to cover the cost.
Schneier, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School and author of such books as Data and Goliath and Click Here To Kill Everybody, regularly challenges his students to write down the first 100 digits of pi, a nearly impossible task­—but not if they cheat, concerning which he admonishes, “Don’t get caught.” Not getting caught is the aim of the hackers who exploit the vulnerabilities of systems of all kinds. Consider right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who located a hack in the tax code: “Because he was one of the founders of PayPal, he was able to use a $2,000 investment to buy 1.7 million shares of the company at $0.001 per share, turning it into $5 billion—all forever tax free.” It was perfectly legal—and even if it weren’t, the wealthy usually go unpunished. The author, a fluid writer and tech communicator, reveals how the tax code lends itself to hacking, as when tech companies like Apple and Google avoid paying billions of dollars by transferring profits out of the U.S. to corporate-friendly nations such as Ireland, then offshoring the “disappeared” dollars to Bermuda, the Caymans, and other havens. Every system contains trap doors that can be breached to advantage. For example, Schneier cites “the Pudding Guy,” who hacked an airline miles program by buying low-cost pudding cups in a promotion that, for $3,150, netted him 1.2 million miles and “lifetime Gold frequent flier status.” Since it was all within the letter if not the spirit of the offer, “the company paid up.” The companies often do, because they’re gaming systems themselves. “Any rule can be hacked,” notes the author, be it a religious dietary restriction or a legislative procedure. With technology, “we can hack more, faster, better,” requiring diligent monitoring and a demand that everyone play by rules that have been hardened against tampering...</span>

On Tuesday, researchers published findings that, for the first time, break TTE’s isolation guarantees. The result is PCspooF, an attack that allows a single non-critical device connected to a single plane to disrupt synchronization and communication between TTE devices on all planes. The attack works by exploiting a vulnerability in the TTE protocol. The work was completed by researchers at the University of Michigan, the University of Pennsylvania, and NASA’s Johnson Space Center...</span>

                              <span>Cooking Mama IP owner Office Create Corp has revealed a court has ruled in its favour following a legal tussle with the publisher of Cooking Mama: Cookstar.


Cookstar has been embroiled in trouble ever since its release on Switch in March 2020, which saw it quickly disappear from Nintendo&#x27;s eShop and physical stores - a move later revealed to be due to a licensing dispute between Office Create and publisher Planet Entertainment.


Office Create claimed Planet Entertainment had refused to correct what it saw as a &quot;wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality and content of the game&quot; during development, despite being contractually obligated to do so, and had instead proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without Office Create&#x27;s approval.

                              <span>Immortality, the acclaimed investigative Hollywood mystery from Her Story developer Sam Barlow, is now available on iOS and Android via Netflix.


Immortality tells the story of Marissa Marcel, a (fictional) actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.


It&#x27;s up to players to find out what happened to Marcel, which, as in Barlow&#x27;s previous games, involves slowly piecing together events by scouring through reams of FMV video. But while Her Story featured faux police interview footage and Telling Lies chose &quot;hacked&quot; webcam video as its medium of choice, Immortality asks players to dig through an archive of film and behind-the-scenes footage, using a machine resembling an old-fashioned Moviola editing device.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; tides are a-turning once more, and next week&#x27;s Season 8 promises to be a bonanza for battle-hardened pirates, delivering an impressively exhaustive new &quot;PvP on demand&quot; system that, among other things, will see ships diving beneath the waves.


Core to Season 8 is a new faction system, enabling players to sign up to either the Pirate Lord&#x27;s Guardians of Fortune or Flameheart&#x27;s Servants of the Flame using the new Hourglass of Fate found on the Captain&#x27;s Table of every ship.


Once active, players can either represent their faction simply by taking on any opposing crews they spot in the world, or they can use the war map to immediately begin matchmaking to find an equally skilled opposing crew. It&#x27;s even possible to fight crews larger than your own if you&#x27;re feeling particularly confident in your PvP abilities.

Described as a &quot;cuddly, ultraviolent skate-slasher&quot; on publisher Wired Productions&#x27; website, Gori: Cuddly Carnage certainly lives up to its name.

                              <span>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Nvidia over a component in its RTX 4090 cards which has been melting for some owners.
The part in questions is believed to be the 12VVHPWR power adadpters, which Nvidia claims it is still investigating the issue, nearly a month after the first cases of melting power adapters were reported by owners.
The lawsuit was filed on 11th November by Lucas Genova to the US District Court for the Northern District of California. It has been filed under &quot;other fraud&quot;, which is defined as &quot;action primarily based on fraud relating to personal property that cannot be classified under any other nature of suit&quot; by the Administrative Office of the US Courts.

That makes for one long Pokérap to name them all. 


Today marks the official launch date for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and with them another 140 distinct species for the franchise&#x27;s overarching National Pokédex.

Please note, while this tribute is not integral to the main story, it does relate to one of the game&#x27;s &#x27;Favour&#x27; side-quests. If you are keen to avoid any spoilers, please refrain from reading further.


As players make their way around God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s realms, they may notice love hearts adorning the environments. These hearts are connected to the Across the Realms side-quest.

                              <span>Can you still P freely? Not if you want to use this specific P, which this week has been trademarked by Microsoft. 


The trademark listing, spotted by Aggiornamenti Lumia, describes Microsoft&#x27;s P as &quot;a geometric design in the shape of an uppercase &#x27;P&#x27; in gradient shades from green to blue&quot;.


Why does Microsoft want this P in particular? Well, it&#x27;s set to be used for computer software of some kind - the trademark itself covers various uses, including programs for &quot;visualising, animating, transforming, presenting and sharing data and other information&quot; as well as &quot;software development tools for the creation of computer software applications and mobile software applications&quot;.

TikToker Ziccs has taken to roleplaying as an Uber driver, picking up players and driving them to a destination in Al Mazrah of their choosing (in return for in-game cash, of course). 

The result is rather hilarious, with Ziccs later encountering one of his passengers in the Gulag. Tragically, Ziccs had eliminated his former customer and apologised for it.

Yet unused graphics found in the data of DS game Super Princess Peach reveal that, at some point in development, goombas were given different emotions.


As shared in a tweet from Supper Mario Broth, several unused goomba designs have been discovered.

This post from Overwatch 2&#x27;s new executive producer acknowledges the team isn&#x27;t &quot;completely satisfied with how everything feels right now,&quot; with Blizzard now looking at the &quot;[opportunities] for improvement that [it needs] to focus on&quot;.


Many of these future improvements will address issues with queue times, with Blizzard currently looking at ways to change the game&#x27;s approach to its Support heroes as a way to remedy the long waits many players have experienced.

A PC release has already been officially confirmed and was originally due out yesterday, but last month publisher Sega announced  the game would be delayed until February 2023.
The game&#x27;s ratings can be found by using the search term &quot;英雄連隊&quot;, the title&#x27;s translation into Chinese. The ratings for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S were all listed today (spotted by Gematsu).

                              <span>PETA wants Sony Santa Monica to add a new mode to God of War Ragnarök to remove violence to animals.


As reported by TheGamer, the animal rights non-profit organisation has asked the developer for a &quot;PETA mode&quot; so Kratos can spare the lives of animals he meets on his journey across the nine realms.

Beware, some major boss spoilers follow.

                              <span>Yuji Naka, known as the father of Sonic the Hedgehog, has reportedly been arrested in Japan on suspicion of insider trading. 


The news was reported this morning by Japanese newspaper Mainichi, and comes a day after two other men were reported to have been charged with insider trading connected to Final Fantasy publisher Square Enix. Naka, you  may recall, worked with the company for a brief stint, creating platformer Balan Wonderworld. 


Naka, 57, is accused of purchasing shares worth 2.8m yen (around £16.8k) in Aiming, a Japanese developer which Square Enix partnered with to make a Dragon Quest mobile game, before the company&#x27;s involvement was public knowledge.

Back in September, the first teaser trailer showed Sonic racing against Shadow in the Green Hill Zone.


Now, though, it seems Sonic will be travelling across a shattered multiverse - check it out in the trailer below.

SMS Protect is a system first rolled out in Overwatch 2 that is designed to stop banned players from creating new accounts and continuing to play. It was later extended to Call of Duty.


The system was controversial at launch as players with prepaid phone numbers were unable to enroll. This disproportionately affected those on the lower end of the income scale who are unable to, or simply cannot afford a pay monthly phone contract.

Hopoo Games&#x27; first stab at Risk of Rain released in 2013, delivering a breathless blast of 2D co-op action pitting players against an ever-more-relentless parade of enemies in an increasingly hilarious ballet of bullets and chaos.


Its acclaimed sequel, which took the whole thing into glorious 3D, released into Steam early access in 2019, and proved hugely popular, selling 3m copies before the year was through. It&#x27;s since got its full release on PC and consoles, and its most recent major update, the Survivors of the Void expansion, arrived in March this year.

Change is an integral part of the Kubernetes life-cycle: as Kubernetes grows and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with improvements for the health of the project. For Kubernetes v1.26 there are several planned: this article identifies and describes some of them, based on the information available at this mid-cycle point in the v1.26 release process, which is still ongoing and can introduce additional changes.
The Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is o…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve already swiped this week&#x27;s Epic Store freebies - Evil Dead: The Game and Dark Deity - and still remain unsated, you might want to pop next Thursday in your diary when something else shoots down the freebie pipe in the form of EA Motive&#x27;s Star Wars: Squadrons.


Star Wars: Squadrons is something of a spiritual successor to LucasArts&#x27; beloved X-Wing and TIE Fighter games. It&#x27;s set during the final days of the Galactic Empire, after the events of Return of the Jedi, and sees players engaging in deep space dogfights, both in multiplayer and in a bit of a solo campaign mode. There&#x27;s even VR support if you&#x27;re appropriately equipped.


Eurogamer enjoyed Star Wars: Squadrons when it released back in 2020, awarding it a Recommended badge and describing it as &quot;an immersive space sim that&#x27;s dazzling in VR [and] an exhilarating multiplayer experience, even if the story feels pedestrian.&quot;

                              <span>Crystal Dynamics has told fans it hears them &quot;loudly and clearly&quot; after a recent survey gauging their views on a potential Legacy of Kain revival received an overwhelmingly positive response.


Back in October, Crystal Dynamics launched a detailed questionnaire asking if the community would be interested in seeing the dark fantasy action-adventure series - which spanned five titles between 1996 and 2003 - make a comeback.


And the response, it turns out, was substantial. &quot;In the past, we&#x27;ve found that surveys typically get between 1,000 and 3,000 responses,&quot; Crystal Dynamics and Eidos CEO Phil Rogers explained during parent company Embracer Group’s latest earnings call (thanks CVG), &quot;but when we asked folk about Legacy of Kain, we received over 100,000 responses.&quot;

                              <span>Actor Scott Porter, who played Harry Osborn in Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, has said he won&#x27;t be reprising the role in Insomniac Games&#x27; upcoming PlayStation 5 sequel.


Porter - who recently portrayed Heimdall in God of War: Ragnarok - was heard in audio logs but only rarely glimpsed as Osborn in the first Spider-Man. However, post-credits sequences found in that game and its Mile Morales follow-up appeared to be setting the character up as Venom in Insomniac&#x27;s &quot;darker&quot; Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2.


Given that Insomniac has already teased Venom as a major antagonist in next year&#x27;s sequel, it seemed a distinct possibility Porter would also be making a return, but the actor has confirmed otherwise in a now-deleted tweet.

                              <span>Today marks the 20th anniversary of Ubisoft&#x27;s much-loved (but distressingly absent) Splinter Cell series, and to mark the occasion the publisher has shared a smattering of concept art for its upcoming - but apparently still &quot;very early&quot; in development - remake.


All this comes via a special 20th anniversary developer roundtable video, culminating in a look at the future of the franchise. There&#x27;s a brief mention of the Netflix animated series - which was announced last June and still in the works despite radio silence since then - and, of course, mention of the eagerly anticipated Splinter Cell reboot.


Ubisoft announced its remake -  described as a ground-up remake - last December, with producer Matt West saying, &quot;We&#x27;re going to update it visually, as well as some of the design elements to match player comfort and expectations, and we are going to keep it linear like the original games, not make it open world.&quot;

Players have been experiencing a range of issues, from crashing clients to not being able to download the game at all. 


Activision Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.Net client disabled downloads yesterday evening across America and Europe.

Speaking to IndieWire, Leguizamo recalled how his directors Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton &quot;fought really hard for [him] to be the lead because [he] was a Latin man&quot;.


The actor stated that the studio had not initially wanted him to be a lead, but the directors&#x27; push to cast him eventually worked - something Leguizamo called &quot;such a breakthrough&quot; for the industry.

                              <span>452,281 people played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 concurrently on Steam last night. 


This massive figure exceeded rival battle royales PUBG and Apex Legends which had a peak concurrent player count last night of 377,558 and 334,431, respectively. 


The game was only beaten by the Valve behemoths Dota 2 and Counter-Strike Global Offensive, which are only distributed via Steam.

                              <span>It has, somehow, been a full year since Battlefield 2042 launched, and while it&#x27;d be premature to say DICE&#x27;s shooter has bounced back from a disastrous launch it&#x27;s certainly on firmer ground than it&#x27;s been for a while. The belated launch of Season One in June was a small step in the right direction, while August&#x27;s Season Two took bigger, bolder strides. Season Three, which kicks off on November 22nd, promises even more in the most radical season yet. 


What&#x27;s most promising is the influx of players that should come as Battlefield 2042 hits Game Pass and EA Play, hopefully ensuring once sparse servers are fully-populated. It&#x27;s part of a bigger push to get people playing Battlefield 2042, with free play periods for everyone across all platforms across December - on Xbox you can play for nada from December 1st-4th, on PC from December 1st-5th and on PlayStation from December 16th-23rd. 


Season Three - which has been dubbed Escalation - also makes some big changes, with the most profound being a return of sorts of the traditional class system to Battlefield, with specialists now being grouped by their roles. There&#x27;s a new specialist in the mix, too, with Rasheed Zain joining the fray. He&#x27;s a double-amputee whose traits include a faster health recharge and an airburst launcher.

                              <span>A modder has released a HD texture pack for Batman: Arkham City, following six years&#x27; worth of development.
Arkham City was first released in 2011, and has since been remastered for PS4 and Xbox One in the  Batman: Return to Arkham collection. Digital Foundry called this release a &quot;mixed bag&quot;, and stated they thought the original PC release was the &quot;definitive&quot; release.
But the PC version of Arkham City has not had a remastered edition - something which modder GPUnity set out to change.

Proximity chat allows players from different squads to talk to each other when they are close by. 


The result has been a barrage of clips capturing these conversations, some of which are predictable moments of trash talk, while others are surprisingly wholesome.

                              <span>A former employee of Final Fantasy publisher Square Enix has been arrested and accused of insider trading. 


38-year-old Taisuke Sazaki, whose video game credits include work on numerous Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts titles, allegedly bought shares in Japanese development company Aiming shortly before Square Enix publicly announced the studio was working on a new Dragon Quest mobile title.

Nippon reports that Sazaki acquired shares worth 20.8m yen (around £125k) between December 2019 and February 2020, after allegedly hearing details of Aiming&#x27;s project.

Hollywood production company Lionsgate has now taken up the project&#x27;s reigns, Deadline reported, following word earlier this year that Sonic the Hedgehog movie maker dj2 Entertainment was also involved.


More promising still is the news that Derek Kolstad, creator and lead writer of the hugely-lucrative John Wick franchise, remains attached, and will reportedly develop its script and act as a producer.

As perhaps expected, the game will run with 4K resolution and 60fps on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, while on PC (Steam) the frame rate can be boosted to 120fps depending on specs.


However, Xbox Series S owners should note that a day one patch will be required in order to hit 60fps, otherwise it&#x27;ll be 30fps.

                              <span>Parts of Grand Theft Auto 5&#x27;s stolen source code have leaked online, and swiftly been removed via copyright strike by Rockstar.


The code in question is a string of scripting functions, as shared on reddit. It includes references to game elements like camera, graphics and cutscenes, as well as gangs and DLC. 


On its own, the leak isn&#x27;t particularly enlightening about the next game in the series, but Rockstar&#x27;s swift takedown proves the legitimacy of the recent leak.

                              <span>Saints Row developer Volition will become part of Borderlands maker Gearbox, Embracer announced today. 


The announcement by Embracer - the parent company of both studios - comes on the same day Volition finally released the &quot;Bright Future&quot; update for its beleagured Saints Row reboot, which belatedly fixes several hundred bugs present since the game&#x27;s launch back in August.


For fans who enjoyed Saints Row, Volition&#x27;s move places the future of that franchise in doubt.

                              <span>Call of Duty players have found an easy way to unlock the M13B Assault Rifle, which is  controversially locked behind a challenge that can only be completed in the new DMZ game mode.  


Even more controversial is the fact that extracting the weapon only unlocks it for the player who picked it up instead of the entire squad. This means your squad will have to make repeated trips back to unlock it for everyone. 


Fortunately, it appears you won&#x27;t have to after all. As you only need to extract with the gun at the end of a round, a squad mate can drop the weapon earned in a previous match for you to pick up. All you need to do now is extract safely and you unlock the weapon (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Rainbow Six Siege players have been looking under the hood of the game to try and understand the new anti-cheat update.
The update was rolled out by Ubisoft on 8th November, and on the game&#x27;s official website the developer listed the features included. The main feature was a new QB initiative  which has been in development for several months. &quot;While we cannot share details of the update in order to protect its integrity,&quot; Ubisoft wrote, &quot;we&#x27;re confident of the solution we&#x27;ve been able to put in place.&quot;
The QB feature was rolled back yesterday to allow Ubisoft to work on fixes for it. In the eight days the feature was live, players took a look at the files to try and understand how the measure worked.

This definitely isn&#x27;t the World Cup. Nope.

As with previous entries in the series, the game concludes with a trailer for the series&#x27; next title - which has already been posted online. However, unlike previous entries to the series, the upcoming game - known as Directive 8020 - looks set to take players to space. 


Yes, this will be yet another game to add to the ever-growing space-horror genre which is having quite the renaissance of late (looking at you Callisto Protocol, Dead Space Remake and Fort Solis).

Speaking to Waypoint Radio, Sawyer said the game was only possible because Game Pass allows for unusual, niche games alongside blockbusters.

WOW, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm and the StarCraft series will become unplayable in China from 23rd January 2023, when NetEase&#x27;s current license expires. Diablo Immortal is unaffected.


This morning, NetEase president Simon Zhu - who says he&#x27;s spent &quot;10,000 hours&quot; playing the above games - reacted to the announcement in an extraordinary statement posted publicly via LinkedIn, where he blamed behind the scenes &quot;damage&quot; done by a &quot;jerk&quot; - who he left unnamed.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has hit another roadblock, albeit a comparatively small one in the grand scheme of things.

                              <span>Bethesda has responded to recent claims made by composer Mick Gordon, calling his lengthy account of mistreatment while working with id Software on the Doom Eternal soundtrack &quot;one-sided and unjust&quot; and a &quot;distortion of the truth&quot;.


Back in May 2020, Doom Eternal executive producer Marty Stratton took to Reddit to address &quot;speculation and criticism&quot; surrounding the the game&#x27;s soundtrack&#x27;s release, and admitting to &quot;eroded trust&quot; between Gordon and id Software.


Then, last week, Gordon took to Medium to share a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton&#x27;s claims, releasing screenshots of emails and legal documents as evidence of the true timeline of events. He went on to allege abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton.

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s November update is rolling out today, making a number of previously Insider-only features - including improved Discord support - available to all users.


Discord server voice chat support for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S initially launched in September, but was somewhat hampered by its convoluted mobile app requirements.


Today&#x27;s Xbox update streamlines the whole process, meaning users simply need to launch a Discord server via their console&#x27;s Parties &amp; chats &gt; Discord option then pick a voice channel from their available Discord servers - and as long their Discord and Xbox accounts are linked, they&#x27;ll be able to join that channel directly, no additional mobile app faff required.

                              <span>Riot Games and Ubisoft have announced a partnership that&#x27;ll see the companies collaborating on a research project with the aim of creating &quot;more positive gaming communities&quot;.


As explained in a blog post on Riot&#x27;s website, the project - which goes by the name Zero Harm in Comms - is the first step in a cross-industry initiative that&#x27;ll see the two companies working on a database to collect in-game data.


This anonymised data - consisting of chat logs labelled by behaviours, from neutral to racist and sexist - will be used to better train AI-based preemptive moderation tools, helping them more effectively recognise and parse, and so detect and mitigate, disruptive behaviour in-game.

Here&#x27;s how it works. The Modern Warfare 2 launcher will serve as the all-encompassing interface to access Modern Warfare 2, DMZ and Warzone 2.0. 


This is known as &quot;Call of Duty HQ&quot; and is presented with the same Netflixy style of tile interface courtesy of Infinity Ward&#x27;s director of UX/UI William Faler who previously served the same role at Hulu.

Some Modern Warfare 2 weapons will be locked behind challenges that can only be completed on other game modes. Most notably, the M13B Assault Rifle is locked behind a challenge in the game&#x27;s new DMZ mode which will be releasing alongside Warzone 2.0. 


According to screenshots posted by the community, players can unlock the weapon by &quot;defeating the chemist in the radiation zone of DMZ and extracting his dropped weapon.&quot;

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&#x27;s next free Title Update is right around the corner, and it&#x27;s a good &#x27;un, adding new monster variants, expanded uses for AI hunters, plus a host of welcome tweaks and refinements when it launches next Thursday, 24th November.


On the monster front, there&#x27;re no brand-new additions in Title Update 3, but some existing favourites do get a bit of a makeover. Elder Dragons Kushala Daora and Teostra, for instance, have now shaken off the affliction, only to emerge in Risen form - both available at Master Rank 120 or higher - causing them to become much more menacing when their anger peaks. 


Then there&#x27;s the Chaotic Gore Magala, unlocked at Master Rank 10 or higher. This unfortunate beast has failed to complete the skin-shedding process that would normally see it turn into the Shagaru Magala, leaving it in a &quot;deformed&quot; halfway state that&#x27;s able to use the attacks of both creatures. Sometimes, says Capcom, it will display &quot;expressions of intense agony&quot;.

                              <span>Where has the time gone? Can you believe that Xbox Live first went, well, live 20 years ago?


But, yes, it really has been that long. On 15th November 2002, Xbox Live (now known, at least officially, as the Xbox network) arrived in our lives, adding online capability to the original Xbox. 


The service&#x27;s popularity saw a steady increase after the launch of Halo 2 and, needless to say, Microsoft has not looked back since. By January 2021, Microsoft reported there were more than 100m Xbox network subscribers (with this figure including those signed up through the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription tier).

                              <span>Clive, the protagonist of Final Fantasy 16, won&#x27;t be the only playable character.


In an interview with Japanese site Game Watch (via PlayStation Lifestyle), creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro noted that in the early stages of the game, players will control a character other than Clive.




When asked if this was similar to Reks in Final Fantasy 12, he agreed.

We&#x27;re expecting Sony to slash the price of its subscriptions in time for Black Friday by 25 percent - making a year&#x27;s worth of PlayStation Plus Premium cost £75 instead of £100.


Word of the upcoming deal comes from Dealabs, which has accurately given advance notice of Sony&#x27;s monthly PlayStation Plus game line-ups for over a year now (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>Phil Spencer has admitted Microsoft has shipped games &quot;too early&quot;.


Speaking to The Verge, the CEO of Microsoft Gaming was asked about the decision to delay Starfield and Redfall, two of the company&#x27;s biggest upcoming exclusives.


&quot;It isn&#x27;t really a decision to move a game after spending the team&#x27;s effort over multiple years just to get to a point where you know you&#x27;re not going to deliver the game you want on the date that was promised,&quot; said Spencer. &quot;Now, it is at some level, because I have shipped games too early. We have experienced shipping games too early.&quot;

Netflix announced Cavill would leave the show at the end of the series three. He will be replaced, in series four, by Liam Hemsworth, the brother of Marvel Thor star Chris Hemsworth.
&quot;Well I think it&#x27;s really sad,&quot; Doug Cockle told me during the latest episode of my podcast One-to-One, available everywhere now (look for &quot;Eurogamer Podcasts&quot;).

                              <span>Six months after enjoyable open water survival adventure Raft drifted serenely out of Steam early access, developer Redbeet Interactive has announced it&#x27;s adapting the game for consoles.


Raft, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, first gained attention as a free itch.io prototype back in 2016. After a two year spell expanding the game&#x27;s core survival loop - in which players chart their raft across a vast ocean, reeling in food, supplies, and building materials to turn their initially tiny vessel into a veritable sea-faring palace - Redbeet launched into Steam early access in 2018.


Raft has come a long way since then, gaining the likes of online co-op, explorable islands, underwater reefs, crop growing, cooking, animal care, and even a full story campaign for its version 1.0 release on PC, which arrived this June.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re still impatiently awaiting Amazon&#x27;s live-action take on the Fallout universe, you might like a look at a newly released Fallout 76 fan project, admirably capturing the ambience of Bethesda&#x27;s long-running series without, I assume, a budget of 150m Bezosbucks.


Created by YouTube channel Infectious Designer (which has also produced live-action shorts inspired by the likes of Half-Life, Killzone, and Watch Dogs), the Fallout 76 concept trailer serves up two minutes and 35 seconds of impressively realised Fallout splendour, replicating the series distinctive retro-futuristic aesthetic both before and after the nuclear apocalypse.


Now, I&#x27;m not going to pretend to be an expert on Fallout 76 - about the only thing I can say with any confidence is that it&#x27;s the 76th game in the Fallout series - but even to my eyes there&#x27;s some lovely attention to detail in Infectious Designer&#x27;s concept trailer, ranging from an authentic Pip-Boy and a hulking Vault suit to what I think is a CGI Scorchbeast. Oh and there&#x27;s enough Nuka-Cola to rot the teeth clean out of your skull.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has revealed Microsoft&#x27;s decision to &quot;pivot away&quot; from its previously announced Game Pass streaming box earlier this year was due to pricing concerns, with the company unable to get the device within its desired $99-$129 price bracket.


Speaking in the latest episode of The Verge&#x27;s Decoder podcast (as spotted by VGC), Spencer explained, &quot;The console we built that now people have seen...was more expensive than we wanted it to be when we actually built it out with the hardware that we had inside.&quot;


Microsoft never formally revealed this version of its streaming box, codenamed Keystone - a standalone device utilising a familiar Xbox user interface, according to Spencer - but it did set tongues wagging when a prototype showed up in a photo of the Xbox boss&#x27; office last month.

12 of the 18 leaders featured in the DLC are new to Civilization 6, while six are described as &quot;new takes&quot; on existing leaders. Each is said to offer &quot;surprising new or updated abilities&quot;, alongside &quot;inventive agendas that&#x27;ll change the way you play&quot;.


Up first are Abraham Lincoln (representing the United States), Queen Nzinga Mbande (Kongo), and Sultan Saladin (Arabia), all arriving as part of the diplomacy focused Great Negotiations Pack on 21st November. 2K is yet to provide launch dates for the Leader Pass&#x27; five remaining DLC releases, but all are due before the end of March 2023.

                              <span>Free-to-play fighter MultiVersus&#x27; second season of content is almost upon us, and, in preparation for its arrival later today, developer Player First Games has detailed what players can expect alongside its new Battle Pass and associated rewards - including progression refinements, a new Big Head mode, and an in-game shop.


Much of Season 2&#x27;s launch day changes focus on the Battle Pass experience, with Player First Games having tweaked progression so all tiers now offer rewards. It&#x27;s also tuned the number of points required to complete each tier so the Battle Pass feels &quot;engaging and rewarding&quot;.


As for those rewards, Season 2&#x27;s Battle Pass unlocks the Baker Street Tom and Jerry skin at tier 50 of the free track, and the paid track features Astronaut Velma at tier 1, Tea Time Reindog at tier 42, and Maestro Bugs Bunny at tier 50.

                              <span>Pikmin Bloom, the social walking game from Pokémon Go maker Niantic, recently passed its first birthday and is now hosting a special event themed around Pikmin 3. 


This event in particular caught my eye, as it will allow you to grow the series&#x27; original Red, Blue and Yellow Pikmin varieties dressed up in the space suits of Pikmin 3&#x27;s main characters: Alph, Brittany, and Charlie.


If you&#x27;re unfamiliar, Pikmin Bloom lets you potter about your neighbourhood growing flower trails and picking up Pikmin seedlings that can grow into Pikmin wearing costumes. If you&#x27;re near a beach, for example, the Pikmin could be wearing a shell, or a discarded bottle cap if collected near a corner shop. It&#x27;s a collection game and a glorified pedometer - and a cute nudge to get off your sofa once in a while.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty will be a paid expansion. 


CD Projekt Red&#x27;s global PR director Radek Grabowski confirmed this news to GamesRadar earlier today. 


Grabowski did not comment on how much the upcoming expansion will cost, however he did note CDPR&#x27;s expansions are &quot;traditionally cheaper than full-priced games&quot;. So, we are looking at under the £60 mark (phew!).

The patent, titled &quot;Tracking Unique In-Game Digital Assets Using Tokens on a Distributed Ledger&quot; shows a theoretical mechanism for tracking the changes to in-game assets, including ownership, visual appearance and metadata (thanks, Gamesual). 


&quot;Individuals often find it meaningful to own or use unique physical items related to respected celebrities or activities,&quot; the patent description notes.

                              <span>Sky Sports is reportedly no longer working with streamer IShowSpeed after news of his misogynistic, racist and abusive comments reached executives at the channel.


Until recently the streamer, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr, was working with Sky Sports, helping with its broadcasts of matches for the English Premier League.


However, the channel has now removed almost all traces of the streamer from its social media feeds (although some still remain).

Speaking via the Decoder podcast, Spencer said the company intended to sell Call of Duty on PlayStation &quot;for as long as players want to play Call of Duty on PlayStation&quot;. 


Back in September, Spencer made a written commitment to PlayStation&#x27;s Jim Ryan that Call of Duty will remain on PlayStation. However, Ryan labelled the statement &quot;inadequate on many levels,&quot; while others point out that a commitment is not a legally binding contract.

                              <span>A new DLC pass for Civilization 6 has seemingly been leaked, with an official announcement expected at some point today.

The leak was spotted on the mobile version of the official website for Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization a few days ago. The image has since been taken down from the website, but not before it was downloaded and screenshotted by several people.

The image has been shared to social media sites including Reddit and ResetEra, and claims the new DLC will be titled Leader Pass.

                              <span>The long-running legal battle between Bungie and Destiny cheat software maker AimJunkies appears to finally be near its conclusion - with victory now in sight for Bungie.


US District Court Judge Thomas Zilly has ruled against AimJunkies&#x27; eyebrow-raising bid to countersue Bungie for allegedly accessing its computers - a retaliatory move which the cheating firm claimed amounted to the Destiny maker hacking it.


Now, a new ruling (first reported by Torrentfreak), has dismissed AimJunkies&#x27; defence and left Bungie looking likely to win its original complaint, which alleged that AimJunkie&#x27;s cheating software infringed on Destiny&#x27;s copyright and trademarks.

Publisher Bandai Namco shared this impressive figure, which is accurate as of 30th September, in a recent Q&amp;A for investors.


It means Elden Ring has moved just shy of another million copies since June. Things are clearly going well for Elden Ring!

                              <span>Details of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0&#x27;s Battle Pass have been revealed early, after the game&#x27;s regional account in Australia and New Zealand posted the trailer before promptly taking it down. 


However, the trailer was already captured and reposted across the web, revealing major changes to the franchise&#x27;s battle pass system. 


Activision has abandoned the linear progression of previous seasons of Call of Duty, opting instead for a &quot;combat map&quot; which gives players a sense of choice of what they unlock. It isn&#x27;t a particularly novel idea, with many other live service games already using a modular battle pass model.

                              <span>Steam versions of various recent Ubisoft games appear to be on the way, according to datamined store details which have popped up online. 


Earlier this month, a Steam version of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla was spotted in Ubisoft Connect&#x27;s database, prompting speculation the smash hit Viking adventure would finally arrive on Valve&#x27;s PC storefront. To date, PC players have only been able to access Valhalla via Ubisoft&#x27;s own launcher or the Epic Games Store.


A Steam version of Ubisoft sports title Roller Champions was also spotted - and today was also made briefly available to view on SteamDb, all but confirming the game will launch there. Roller Champions feels like it has struggled to find much of an audience to date; a Steam launch would certainly help it along.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is now available to preload ahead of the game&#x27;s release tomorrow - but doing so is anything but straightforward.


PlayStation 4 and 5 owners searching for Warzone 2.0 last night were unable to find the download by searching &quot;Call of Duty Warzone&quot; in the PlayStation Store, while Steam users who own Modern Warfare 2 found no download whatsoever. 

Things are a little better on Xbox where Warzone 2.0 is discoverable with its own store page. Still, on closer inspection, the download confusingly also appears to bundle Modern Warfare 2 for free.

In addition to this news, Guerrilla also released a trailer for Call of the Mountain, which you can see below.

A number of other older Nintendo Switch games have simultaneously been updated, including Super Mario Maker 2 and Splatoon 2.


And the same mysterious update has also been added to Switch smash hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which Nintendo abandoned a year ago, after 18 months of patchy post-launch support.

According to Far From Home, over 80,000 people played the Forever Skies demo, resulting in a &quot;wave of positive and constructive feedback&quot; the studio wants to implement before launching into Early Access - something it was initially planning to do before the end of this year.


&quot;On the surface everything seemed great,&quot; Far From Home says of its recent feedback. &quot;83% of respondents rated the demo as 8/10 or above. But when we looked deeper, we started seeing things that a lot of players said they missed.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has detailed the next round of Xbox homepage &quot;experiments&quot; coming to Insider testing this week, including new layouts, pinned groups, and more.


These additions are the latest in what Microsoft previously described as a &quot;multi-month series of experiments to learn how to create a more personalised home screen experience and address some of the top trends and fan requests&quot;.


The plan, it explained, is to iterate on these features as testing continues, with the goal being to launch a &quot;new, better Home experience&quot; some time in 2023.

                              <span>An eye-catching Superman demo, made in Unreal Engine 5 and widely circulated online earlier this year, has been taken and sold on Steam as an $11 game.


The original proof-of-concept demo - titled A Superman Style Flight Experience (UE5) - was created by Toybox Games&#x27; Tyson Butler-Boschma, utilising the City Sample from Epic Games&#x27; The Matrix Awakens as a sandbox for superhero flight. In April, Butler-Boschma made the playable demo freely available via itch.io, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s here things begin to go awry.


At the start of November, Butler-Boschma was alerted to the fact an entity calling itself Hero Game Studios had taken his demo - a project he created &quot;for fun to show what could be made&quot; in Unreal Engine 5 - and started selling it on Steam under the name Heroes City Superman Edition with an asking price of $10.99 USD.

Microsoft says it&#x27;s publishing its inaugural Digital Transparency Report as part of its &quot;long-standing commitment to online safety&quot;, with the aim being to release an updated report every six months so it can address key learnings and do more to &quot;help people understand how to play a positive role in the Xbox community.&quot;


Much of the document is spent reiterating the various tools and processes Microsoft and Xbox players have at their disposal to ensure users remain safe and community guidelines are adhered to, ranging from parental controls to reporting.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök portrays Kratos as a somewhat more level-headed god-killing powerhouse than in some of his past adventures which, to be honest, showed Sony&#x27;s protagonist in a less, erm, morally sound light. Ok, ok, let&#x27;s face it, Kratos was a bit of a knob in the past.


One NPC that would whole-heartily agree with me on this is the boat captain from the original God of War. Remember him? It is hard not to, as he was certainly put through it by Kratos. 

Please note, some of the below could be considered spoilers. If you&#x27;re still reading and want to go into the God of War series blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

The lucky employee will be &quot;immersed in the organising and shaping of Sonic lore, canon, characters, and universes, helping to bring consistency, connectivity, and creativity to all things Sonic across various forms of media including games, animation, comics, and more.&quot;

Titled LLL, the game is a sci-fi, third-person shooter MMO set in Seoul.

LLL was revealed alongside an interview with the game&#x27;s project leader Bae Jaehyun and two videos.

                              <span>Tactics Ogre: Reborn has a silly swear filter which is blocking one of the game&#x27;s own default names it can suggest for you to use.


The revamped role-playing classic will offer the title of &quot;Flamescale&quot; for characters whose date of birth is listed as between 2nd and 25th May. However, the game then tells you &quot;Flamescale&quot; is actually not allowed, as it contains &quot;banned words&quot;.


This issue, picked up by fan Choojermelon on Twitter (thanks, PCGamer) appears to stem from the name&#x27;s inclusion of &quot;mescal&quot;, the illegal psychedelic enjoyed by Hunter S. Thompson and others.

That&#x27;s no different with Sonic Frontiers. While Sonic is free in the open zone, the cyberspace levels show up the awkwardness of Sonic&#x27;s movement.


Now there&#x27;s a mod to fix that, courtesy of BeatzYT3 over on GameBanana. Their Improved Physics mod makes a number of changes to momentum and balance to ensure Sonic&#x27;s movement feels more fluid.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök is an impressive looking game, there is no denying it. The sweeping vistas of the Nine Realms are breathtaking, and suit the norse epic&#x27;s overarching narrative perfectly. 


But would this game work as well if it had been released in the 90s? Given the look of a recent fan-made demake trailer, I would absolutely have still played it!


The demake trailer in question comes from creator Jackarte. It sees heroes Kratos and Atreus, as well as Ragnarök&#x27;s towering god Tyr and the vengeful Freya, all reimagined as PlayStation 1 characters.

An update to Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese repair and warranty regulations in October warned customers they may no longer be eligible for a product repair or replacement if they are found to have behaved inappropriately to staff. 


This includes instances where a staff member has been threatened or verbally abused, or where a customer may have been deliberately wasting their time.

The Easter egg was found by Redditor HughesMDflyer4, who shared how to activate it on the Flight Simulator subreddit.

An upcoming fan-project known as Jurassic Park Operations from Krenautican sees action from the 1993 film reimaged in PlayStation&#x27;s game creation system. And, I won&#x27;t lie, it looks so good I had to do a double take to make sure I wasn&#x27;t watching something from Spielberg himself.


While this project has evidently been in the works for a while, the team recently revealed its full trailer for the game.

                              <span>An European Commission staff member has raised eyebrows for their public comments on the organisation&#x27;s ongoing investigation into Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover bid - and prompted the EU Commission itself to respond. 


Last week, Commission member Ricardo Cardoso tweeted to say that the organisation was &quot;working to ensure that you will still be able to play Call of Duty on other consoles (including my PlayStation).&quot;


On the one hand, the comment simply describes the situation as Microsoft has too - that Activision&#x27;s blockbuster shooter franchise will remain on Sony platforms &quot;as long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to&quot;. On the other, fans expressed surprise a Commission staff member was discussing the matter publicly, and expressing an opinion which seemed mostly concerned with their own console choice.

                              <span>Cut dialogue from Sonic Frontiers suggests that Sonic might have feelings for Amy all along.


Amy was first introduced to the series in Sonic The Hedgehog CD as a love interest, but their relationship was always implied to be unrequited. Sonic is far too busy going really fast to have a relationship.


But YouTuber Faz Faz has discovered unused dialogue in the game&#x27;s files in which Sonic ponders their relationship, spotted by TheGamer.

                              <span>Fortnite has stunned fans by signalling an early end to its third map at the conclusion of its current season, via a live event named Fracture set to take place at 9pm UK time on 3rd December. 


Fracture was teased tonight by developer Epic Games at the conclusion of Fortnite Champion Series, its first major in-person Fortnite competition for several years. A title card for Fracture appeared after the tournament&#x27;s trophy presentation, simply listing the upcoming live event&#x27;s date, time, and description as the &quot;Chapter 3 Finale event&quot;. 


Each in-game &quot;Chapter&quot; of Fortnite has so far concluded with a complete reboot of the battle royale&#x27;s beloved Island. After two years and 10 seasons, the game&#x27;s original Island got sucked into a black hole in October 2019. After another two years, this time divided into eight seasons, the game&#x27;s second Island was flipped over to reveal the current map lying underneath in December 2021.

                              <span>Diablo 4&#x27;s world will permit players to leave and pick up the story at will, but although it will &quot;allow for non-linearity&quot;, the story will have &quot;a beginning, middle, and end&quot;.

In an interview with IGN, Diablo 4 director Joe Shely and general manager Rod Fergusson opened up on what the new adventure has in store for fans of the franchise, as well as give a little insight into how the game&#x27;s storytelling mechanics will differ from the Diablo games that have come before it.

&quot;One of the concerns about putting &#x27;open world&#x27; in a big neon and flashing that sign is that people have that notion of Breath of the Wild, &#x27;oh, it’s completely organic and I can go anywhere and do anything&#x27;,&quot; Fergusson said, as transcribed by NME.

In a tweet posted to Twitter and spotted by VGC, Kishimoto intimated that although the team was &quot;relieved&quot; that the game was finally out and in the hands of players, it was &quot;checking the opinions of the critics and everyone&quot; and still had &quot;a long way to go&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m sorry I couldn&#x27;t contact you because I&#x27;ve been busy since the release date,&quot; Kishimoto tweeted to their followers, as translated by Google. &quot;I&#x27;m relieved that the release date has arrived and that it seems to have reached everyone safely.

That&#x27;s according to a new dev blog on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Steam page, which also promises we&#x27;ll get a peek at new features &quot;before the year is out&quot; courtesy of Patch 9.

&quot;The good news is that we’re on track for release in 2023 – and we’ll have more on that in December,&quot; the blog confirms. &quot;Acts 2 and 3 of the story are being actively playtested to ensure they’re up to the same level of polish and you’ll soon discover that there’s much more in the works (or already complete) than what you’ll encounter in an Early Access playthrough.

Developer Rare tweeted the news late yesterday, along with confirmation that a full reveal of what&#x27;s coming up will be streamed next Friday, 18th November, at 7pm UK time (4pm UTC, 8am PT / 11am ET).

Hopefully we&#x27;ll find out more about the community&#x27;s decision in the current Adventure, Return of the Damned, too, alongside sneaky peeks about other new Adventures and Mysteries, the Plunder Pass, and usual bug and QoL fixes.

                              <span>EA and Motive have revealed the voice actors cast in its Dead Space remake.

Although we already knew that previously silent protagonist Isaac Clarke would now be voiced by Gunner Wright - the original voice of Isaac in Dead Space 2 and 3 - Motive has now revealed the rest of the cast.

Tanya Clarke - no relation to Isaac - is back as Nicole Brennan, having provided her voice and likeness in the first game and Dead Space 2. Former NHL athlete Anthony Alabi is on board to portray the no-nonsense Zach Hammond, fresh from his roles in Shameless and Family Reunion.

                              <span>Here in 2022, we have a newly declassified 2016 Inspector General report—”Misuse of Sigint Systems”—about a 2013 NSA program that resulted in the unauthorized (that is, illegal) targeting of Americans.
Given all we learned from Edward Snowden, this feels like a minor coda. There’s nothing really interesting in the IG document, which is heavily redacted.

                              <span>When Sony unveiled release details for PSVR2 earlier this month, it only confirmed two launch day titles - Horizon: Call of the Mountain and Quest 2 port Cities VR: Enhanced Edition. However, it turns out No Man&#x27;s Sky fans also have something to look forward to, with Hello Games confirming to Eurogamer that its previously announced PSVR2 update will be arriving alongside Sony&#x27;s new hardware on 22nd February next year.


Hello Games revealed a PSVR2 update for No Man&#x27;s Sky was in the works back in June, teasing an enhanced VR experience that would utilise the power of PlayStation 5, PSVR2, and its new Sense controllers to build on the game&#x27;s 2019 VR implementation, and &quot;take that sense of immersion and believability up by several major notches.&quot;


Evidence that PSVR2 owners wouldn&#x27;t have to wait long for No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s promised VR upgrade first surfaced earlier this week when sharp-eyed PS5 Store users (by which I mean Eurogamer&#x27;s resident VR aficionado Ian Higton) spotted an updated description on Hello Games&#x27; PSVR2 reveal trailer, pointing to a February 2022 release.

                              <span>Kevin Conroy, perhaps best known for his much-loved portrayal of Batman in TV&#x27;s Animated Series and the Arkham series of games, has died aged 66 following a short battle with cancer.


Conroy, whose acting career began in the late 70s, first voiced Batman in Fox Kids&#x27; Batman: The Animated series, which would go on to run for 85 episodes between 1992 and 1995. His portrayal has remained a fan favourite ever since, with Conroy later voicing the role across a multitude of mediums, including 15 films.


In video games, he made his mark on the likes of developer Rocksteady&#x27;s acclaimed Arkham trilogy, NetherRealm&#x27;s superhero fighter Injustice, and, more recently, MultiVersus.

                              <span>Krafton, the South Korean company behind PUBG: Battlegrounds, has announced it&#x27;s buying The Ascent developer Neon Giant.


Krafton made the announcement in its latest earnings report, saying the acquisition was part of an ongoing investment in its &quot;development and service capabilities [that would] ensure a steady pipeline of premium titles&quot;.


Although Neon Giant only has one title to its name so far -  last year&#x27;s cyberpunk action-RPG The Ascent - the Swedish studio was founded by industry veterans with credits on the likes of Doom, Wolfenstein, Gears of War, and Far Cry 3.

Further changes will also come in patch 6.35, including an update to the farming sim mode Island Sanctuary.

                              <span>Earlier this week we heard the unusual news that player-versus-player MMO Crowfall, which launched in the summer of 2021, will be taken offline and taken back to the drawing board, where it will be rethought. There&#x27;s no word on how long this will take, only that &quot;nothing is off the table&quot; in terms of what potentially may change.
Game operator Monumental said this was because it didn&#x27;t have the headspace or resources to rethink the game while it was running it, and suggested Crowfall could return looking quite different indeed. If, that is, it returns. Crowfall has struggled since launch, and it was sold to Monumental in December 2021 partly because of this - because it needed significant change.
I cannot ever remember an MMO ever doing something similar. In this article, I talk to Monumental about the decision and what it could mean. But first, a bit of background.

                              <span>After months (and months) of anticipation, God of War Ragnarök finally released this week. Now that it is out in the world, many - myself included - are taking some time to marvel at how truly packed the nine realms really are. 


The amount of detail Sony Santa Monica has put into its game is astounding, from animals scurrying through trees right down to Kratos&#x27; wrinkled elbows. But some of these details and Easter eggs are easily missed, so here is a small selection of ones that I have noticed so far. 

Please note, some of these details could be considered spoilers. If you&#x27;re still reading and want to go into the game blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

                              <span>One God of War Ragnarök fan has found, and subsequently unlocked, the game&#x27;s unfinished photo mode. 


Developer Sony Santa Monica recently stated that, while a photo mode would not be available on the game&#x27;s launch, it would be coming further down the line by way of an update. This is much the same as with 2018&#x27;s God of War. 


However, prolific modder Speclizer (who was responsible for unearthing the canned multiplayer map files in the Last of Us Part 2) has managed to find Ragnarök&#x27;s photo mode and get it working.

The developer had previously stated two Control games were in the works, including a multiplayer spin-off and Codename Heron, though a sequel was not formally announced.



In a blog post alongside the announcement, game director Mikael Kasurinen described the sequel as &quot;the most exciting project I&#x27;ve ever worked on&quot;.

Their new roles would see the overall creative direction of films, TV and animation for the DC Universe united under a single banner.


But, it now looks like this is also going to include any future games, with Warner Bros Discovery head David Zaslav recently expressing his excitement for the new structure Gunn and Safran would bring to the studio along with their appointment.

                              <span>Another Thursday means another glimpse ahead at the Epic Games Store&#x27;s next set of weekly freebies, with Evil Dead: The Game and tactical turn-based RPG Dark Deity both now confirmed to be free from Thurday, 17th November.


Evil Dead: The Game, which released as an Epic exclusive back in May, is developer Saber Interactive&#x27;s spin on the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre. It sees four human Survivors (picking from a range of familiar Evil Dead characters, armed with everything from chainsaws to boomsticks) roaming a spooky forest in search of artefacts, while a fifth player gives chase as one of four powerful demons - the Warlord, Puppeteer, Necromancer, or Plaguebringer, all able to command undead armies of their own.


And it&#x27;s good fun, effectively marrying the gleefully cartoonish horror of Sam Raimi&#x27;s beloved franchise to a solidly entertaining multiplayer game.

Announced back in June, Dragon Age: Absolution takes place in Tevinter - the setting for developer BioWare&#x27;s highly anticipated next video game instalment, Dragon Age Dreadwolf - and stars a cast of fresh faces, including protagonist Miriam.


&quot;With great power at stake, a group of mages, fighters, and thieves goes head to head against a sinister force possessing a dangerous artifact,&quot; Netflix teases beneath its newly released Absolution trailer. &quot;Fear. Guilt. Pain. Can Miriam push aside her feelings to complete her mission - or will the trauma looming over her past finally catch up with her?&quot;.

The studio made the announcement in its latest developer update, which highlights some of the new additions coming to Battlefield 2042 as part of Season 3 and beyond.


Season 3, which is yet to receive an official start date, includes a new multiplayer map, a new Specialist, new weapons - including Bad Company 2&#x27;s XM8 and Battlefield 3&#x27;s A-91 - plus a new Battle Pass. It&#x27;ll also usher in map reworks for Manifest and Breakaway.

                              <span>While we continue to wrestle with the fact Henry Cavill has whipped off his white Witcher wig for the very last time, Netflix is forging ever onward into the Witcherverse, this time with a new trailer for its upcoming live-action prequel Blood Origin.


Blood Origin isn&#x27;t Netflix&#x27;s first Witcher prequel, of course; last year saw the streaming service release an animated movie called The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, focusing on Geralt of Rivia&#x27;s friend and mentor Vesemir.


Blood Origin, though, goes some considerable way further back in the series&#x27; timeline, telling a story set 1,200 years before Geralt and the events we&#x27;re familiar with from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s books, CD Projekt&#x27;s games, and Netflix&#x27;s existing TV show.

Blood Origin isn&#x27;t Netflix&#x27;s first Witcher prequel, of course; last year saw the streaming network release an animated movie called The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, focusing on Geralt of Rivia&#x27;s friend and mentor Vesemir.


Blood Origin, though, goes some considerable way further back in the series&#x27; timeline, telling a story set 1,200 years before Geralt and the events we&#x27;re familiar with from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s books, CD Projekt&#x27;s games and Netflix&#x27;s existing TV show.

                              <span>Mick Gordon, known for his work on soundtracks for several games including the Wolfenstein and Doom series, has released a statement in response to accusations made against him by Marty Stratton in May 2020.

In April 2020, Gordon distanced himself from the soundtrack album for Doom Eternal after it received criticisms from fans on its quality. This led to speculation from fans about its production, and Stratton, who was working as executive producer on Doom Eternal, posted an open letter to the Doom subreddit to address rumours. 

A year and a half later, Gordon has written a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton&#x27;s claims, with screenshots of emails and legal documents (with sensitive information removed) as evidence of the true timeline of events. He posted his statement on Medium, in which he alleged abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton. Gordon stated he has released it to defend himself, and urged people to not use it as an excuse for a hate campaign.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing the now-widespread leaks of new Pokémon designs from the upcoming Scarlet and Violet games.

Pokémon details always leak - often months before launch, but especially in the last few weeks as retail copies begin appearing in the wild. Should you look at spoilers? For some, uncovering the many unannounced creatures as they play is a core part of the games. For others, knowing what your new Starter Pokémon will eventually evolve into is a big deal.  
Whichever side of the debate you&#x27;re on, there&#x27;s no doubting the level of interest in new Pokémon designs - seen this week when the final evolution of Starter cat creature Sprigatito sparked an avalanche of dubious fanart after an image was posted by a leaker. Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Yesterday, Call of Duty developer Infinity Ward detailed what&#x27;s in store for players when its free-to-play Warzone 2.0 launches alongside Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s first season on 16th November.


This included a little bit more on its brand-new &quot;experience&quot; known as DMZ.


This Escape From Tarkov-inspired mode is described as an &quot;open-world, narrative-focused extraction mode where Operator squads have free rein to complete faction-based missions, take on additional side objectives, engage with enemy Operators or AI combatants, and search for valuable items, all while fighting to survive toward exfiltration&quot;.

                              <span>Iconic Halo map Blood Gulch has been recreated in the game&#x27;s new Forge mode, just hours after its official beta went live. 


The long-awaited Forge offering officially arrived yesterday as part of Halo Infinite&#x27;s Winter Update, and of course Blood Gulch was one of the first things on anyone&#x27;s mind to recreate.


Halo fan Epsilon_church_ posted word of their creation to Twitter yesterday evening and invited others to try the map for themselves. Amusingly, however, it needed to be named &quot;Coagulation&quot;, as &quot;BloodGulch&quot; was blocked.

It&#x27;s been developed by PixelCount Studios, comprising veterans of the Fable series, and chaired by Games Workshop founder Sir Ian Livingstone.

A detailed FAQ page on the process is now available for Stadia customers to browse, but in a nutshell it boils down to: sit tight. 


Google will attempt to refund you for most things you bought to do with Stadia - except for the Stadia Pro subscription. It&#x27;ll keep your money for that.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Sony gave its PlayStation Plus subscription service a makeover, adding three new tiers for users to pick between. 


The cheapest of these tiers is Essential and is basically what PlayStation Plus once was. Users get online play, some other smaller perks and free PlayStation titles every month. Then we have Extra. This middle-ground tier includes everything that comes with Essential, but with the bonus of a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games to have a go at.


Then, finally, we have the most expensive of these tiers, known as Premium. This was marketed as a way for users to replay some of PlayStation&#x27;s classic games from days gone by. The service covers every PlayStation console - from the original PS1 through to the PS5, as well as the PSP and, thanks to streaming, PS3 support.

                              <span>The developers of Sonic Frontiers took &quot;countermeasures&quot; to ensure players wouldn&#x27;t experience motion sickness.


The blue blur is known for going really fast, so it&#x27;s appreciated that the developers took care to not let that negatively affect players.


Producer Sachiko Kawamura told Famitsu that the QA team were integral to this process and that it was important to take this aspect of the game seriously (thanks Siliconera).

                              <span>Twitter users are using the platform&#x27;s new Elon Musk era changes to impersonate official video game companies. 


For a small fee, anyone can now pay up and receive a blue Twitter verified tick next to their name. So, of course, people are handing over their $8 specifically in order to trick others online.


A verified &quot;Nintendo of America&quot; account went viral last night as it posted an image of the company&#x27;s mascot Mario giving the middle finger. The handle, @nIntendoofus, has now had their account suspended - but not until their tweets had been widely shared.

                              <span>Activision has shared a whole load of information on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0&#x27;s first season ahead of its arrival next Wednesday, 16th November, including details of a major battle pass overhaul.


Ditching the linear level progression still used by most games, Call of Duty&#x27;s new battle pass will adopt a system reminiscent of that seen in Fortnite, where players have more freedom in which battle pass items they can unlock and when.


Activision&#x27;s battle pass overhaul presents itself as a multi-sector map, with players able to unlock five items in each of its 20 sectors using earned Battle Token Tier skips. These tokens can either unlock more items within an already available sector or unlock adjacent sectors.

Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari, nonprofit Firefox and others allow the company, TrustCor Systems, to act as what’s known as a root certificate authority, a powerful spot in the internet’s infrastructure that guarantees websites are not fake, guiding users to them seamlessly.
The company’s Panamanian registration records show that it has the identical slate of officers, agents and partners as a spyware maker identified this year as an affiliate of Arizona-based Packet Forensics, which public contracting records and company documents show has sold communication interception services to U.S. government agencies for more than a decade...</span>

                              <span>20 months after developer SCS announced American Truck Simulator was setting its sights on Texas as one of its next destinations, the long-in-the-works expansion finally has a release date and is coming to Steam next Tuesday, 15th November.


Texas will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 11th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. It was confirmed to be in development last March, but SCS warned the expansion could be a long time coming given the sheer effort required to bring one of the US&#x27; largest states into the game.


However, with Texas&#x27; arrival now less than a week away, SCS has given us our best look yet at the expansion&#x27;s numerous familiar sights - its newly released  launch trailer featuring the likes of Austin, Houston, and a whole lot of countryside.

There&#x27;s a lot more where that came from though, with Nintendo choosing to highlight over 20 promising new indie titles heading to Switch before next summer is through - a few of which, such as the wonderful Rogue Legacy 2, are out today. Read on for the full round-up!

                              <span>Disco Elysium game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have published an explosive open letter to fans detailing their ousting from ZA/UM, the game&#x27;s development studio.
Most eye-opening is the claim ZA/UM&#x27;s new majority shareholder, an Estonian firm named Tütreke OÜ, allegedly obtained control of the company through fraud. Tütreke OÜ is a &quot;vehicle&quot; for two Estonian businessmen, the pair wrote, namely Ilmar Kompus (now ZA/UM&#x27;s CEO) and Tõnis Haavel (who was previously &quot;convicted for defrauding investors on a different matter in 2007&quot;).


At the same time, ZA/UM CEO Kompus has published, via Estonian newspaper Ekspress, allegations of mismanagement by Kurvitz and a previous minority shareholder of the company, Saandar Taal. The pair are accused of &quot;belittling women and co-workers&quot; and creating a &quot;toxic environment&quot;. Kompus also states the pair had been &quot;intending to steal IP&quot; - namely, Disco Elysium - with an eye to departing the studio and working elsewhere.

                              <span>Ten months after Bandai Namco pulled online support for its Dark Souls trilogy on PC, online services for Dark Souls Remastered - the only series entry yet to be addressed by the publisher - have finally been restored.


Servers for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin, and Dark Souls 3 were &quot;temporarily deactivated&quot; back in January following reports the games were vulnerable to Remote Code Execution exploits began to make headlines.


Several weeks later, Bandai Namco offered an update, saying the issue would&#x27;t be addressed until after the release of Elden Ring, but Dark Souls fans&#x27; patience was finally rewarded in August when online features for Dark Souls 3 were restored. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin followed in October, with the publisher promising to reactive servers for the original Dark Souls 2 at &quot;a later date&quot;.

                              <span>Remember Saints Row? The wacky open world reboot launched at the end of August to a lukewarm response. This month, developer Volition has a big patch ready to address hundreds of issues. 

This is the game&#x27;s first major update which Volition previously said would be used to prioritise fixes and improvements over new content. Last month, the studio said it had chosen to spend time bringing the existing game up to scratch - even though it would have &quot;preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions&quot;.

&quot;Significant effort and testing&quot; has gone into fixing the game&#x27;s co-op, Volition said today. Connectivity, map issues and rewards should all work more smoothly post-patch.

                              <span>Ahead of its release next summer, Final Fantasy 16 has received plenty of praise for its colossal Eikon battles between mythical beasts, stunning fantasy realm, and fast-paced action full of spectacular magical effects.


But one major criticism has been the distinct lack of diversity in its main cast.


Last week, director Naoki Yoshida addressed the lack of diversity in an interview. It fits the &quot;isolated nature of this realm&quot; he said, as well as the inspiration of Medieval Europe.

                              <span>Nothing can stop the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet leaks - not least the dozens and dozens of Pokémon fans already turning the game&#x27;s latest still-officially-unannounced creature into somewhat dubious fan art.


If you ever need reminding how popular Pokémon is, simply type one of the creatures&#x27; names into social media and see how many image results you get. This is true even for Pokémon so far only glimpsed in leaked screenshots from early copies, images of which Nintendo is busy scrubbing from the internet.


Fan art created from seeing these leaked images, though, is another matter. For example, this morning I learned the final evolution of Grass-type cat and Scarlet and Violet Starter Pokémon Sprigatito had leaked online after I saw someone on Twitter discussing its design. (And if you&#x27;re still reading and want to go into the new games blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.)

As well as streaming games to consoles, Sony&#x27;s subscription service allows players to stream games on PC.


However, as a PlayStation Blog from the release in May states, PC streaming is not available in the following countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

The news comes courtesy of artist Thomas Feichtmeir who released a screenshot of artwork used in the pitch to the publisher six years ago - now, the NDA is finally up.


Feichtmeir also worked on Blasphemous, itself a Metroidvania inspired by the Dark Souls series.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever played Destiny, you&#x27;ll know of Telesto. This exotic weapon is a fan-favourite for its exploding purple projectiles - and also notorious for often being bugged. 


It&#x27;s broken nature is so notorious, in fact, that Destiny developer Bungie has now added an Easter egg to the game where Telesto fails to properly fire - and instead sends its projectiles floating lazily into the sky while the weapon itself fizzes and sparks. (A simple reload clears the Easter egg, and the gun can then be used as normal.)


But while this appeared at first to be just a fun nod to Telesto&#x27;s oft-bugged state, fans are now suggesting the Easter egg may hint at a further secret, as Destiny 2 heads towards the end of its current season.

                              <span>Meta, the owner of Facebook and maker of Meta Quest VR headsets, will cut 11,000 jobs in a deep effort to restructure its business, boss Mark Zuckerburg announced today. 


The move will see Meta&#x27;s overall workforce shrink by 13 percent, with some areas of the business impacted more than others. 


Specifically how this will impact the company&#x27;s development of Meta Quest remains unclear, though Zuckerburg stated today that the company&#x27;s &quot;long-term vision for the metaverse&quot; remained one of a small number of &quot;high priority growth areas&quot;.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 will have a new Dynamic Control Scheme that makes button mashing effective.


The option is all part of Capcom&#x27;s efforts to make its forthcoming fighting game the most accessible yet.


A few simple button taps is enough to have your character performing all sorts of moves, determined dynamically by the A.I. based on character position and situation.

                              <span>Almost ten months after it acquired Josh Wardle&#x27;s free browser-based puzzler and cultural phenomenon Wordle for an undisclosed seven-figure sum, the New York Times has announced the game is finally getting a dedicated editor.


Since launch, Wordle&#x27;s puzzles have drawn from the same list of five-letter words - originally totalling 2,315, but now down by six - with a new word solution being presented each day. Starting today, though, that word list will be fully curated by Wordle&#x27;s new dedicated editor, Tracy Bennett.


&quot;Wordle&#x27;s gameplay will stay the same,&quot; the publication explains in its announcement, &quot;and answers will be drawn from the same basic dictionary of answer words&quot;. However, Bennett will be responsible for making &quot;some editorial adjustments to ensure that the game stays focused on vocabulary that’s fun, accessible, lively and varied.&quot;

343 has provided extended release notes on its website, but the key additions start with the aforementioned campaign network co-op, making it possible for up to four players to experience Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign together. Crossplay between PC and Xbox devices is supported, and progress and unlocks are shared across all players, not just the host.


To accompanying the arrival of campaign co-op, the developer has added 24 new achievements, many of which will require collaboration to complete.

                              <span>The European Commission has announced that, following its initial investigation into Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it will now be opening a more &quot;in-depth&quot; Phase 2 probe to determine the deal&#x27;s likely impact on competition.


In a statement on its website, the European Commission said it had made the decision after its preliminary investigation showed Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition may &quot;significantly reduce competition on the markets for the distribution of console and PC video games, including multi-game subscription services and/or cloud game streaming services, and for PC operating systems&quot;.


It drew particular attention to its concerns Microsoft has a &quot;potential economic incentive&quot; to prevent competitors from accessing Activision Blizzard&#x27;s &quot;high-profile and highly successful games&quot; upon closure of the deal, specifically highlighting the Call of Duty series - something Microsoft has repeatedly insisted it will not do.

                              <span>With Awesome Games Done Quick&#x27;s next charity speedrun event rapidly gaining on us, organisers have revealed timings for all 140+ speedruns scheduled for the January 2023 show.


Next year&#x27;s Awesome Games Done Quick runs from 8th-15th January, and will once again be an online-only event as organisers look to move its in-person component away from its usual haunt of Florida. Earlier this year, organisers said the state&#x27;s &quot;continued disregard for COVID-19&#x27;s dangers... and an increased aggression towards LGBTQ+ individuals&quot; made it impossible to provide a &quot;safe and welcoming&quot; event for all.


While the lack of an in-person event might be a disappointment for some, Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 will still feature an extensive speedrunning schedule, running 24 hours everyday across the week with an occasional pauses for breaks. As ever, it&#x27;s an eclectic line-up - covering triple-A titles, smaller-scale indie offerings, retro classics, and other assorted oddities (I can&#x27;t pretend I&#x27;m not immediately intrigued by a game called Salamander County Public Television) - and you can have a leisurely peruse on the Games Done Quick website.

This project is reported to be in development with Korean Studio NCsoft, which is most famous for publishing the MMORPG Guild Wars and its subsequent sequel.


A source familiar with both Sony and NCsoft reportedly told Korean news site MTN the two companies have &quot;tentatively agreed to pursue a business partnership in which NC will create new games using Sony&#x27;s promising game IP&quot;.

The tour begins next Tuesday, 15th November, with five bits of DLC - two Content Creator Packs (each costing £4.79/$5.99 USD/€5.99), two radio stations (priced at £2.89/$3.99 USD/€3.99 each), and a free update. The first of these, the Heart of Korea Content Creator Pack, adds 60 assets - including service buildings and unique structures - inspired by South Korean cities. It arrives alongside the K-Pop Radio Station DLC.


Cities: Skylines players can also pick up the Skyscrapers Content Creator Pack on the same day, featuring 15 skyscrapers inspired by iconic buildings around the world. This one&#x27;s twinned with the separate 80&#x27;s Downtown Beat Radio Station DLC.

                              <span>Today brings our final big information dollop for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet ahead of their release next week - and our first look at a feature in the game which has remained under wraps until now. 


Each game will feature a separate book of expedition records with rare Pokémon to track down, letting you retrace their steps to encounter them yourselves. However, it sounds like the Scarlet Book and the Violet Book will feature alternate versions of these Pokémon, depending on which version of the upcoming games you have.


Put more simply: today&#x27;s trailer appears to show a pair of new evolutions for Donphan. One is primal looking with huge tusks, which you&#x27;ll meet in Scarlet. One is futuristic-looking with dot-matrix eyes, which you&#x27;ll meet in Violet.

                              <span>Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus VR and creator of the Oculus Rift, has designed a new VR headset to celebrate the popular light novel and anime series Sword Art Online which can also kill you.

The plot of Sword Art Online revolves around a massive multiplayer online role-playing game in VR, which is played using a headset called the NerveGear. A number of players get locked into the game and the NerveGear can&#x27;t be removed whilst a player is still online. And (spoiler alert) it&#x27;ll kill a player in real-life if they die in the game. 

Luckey revealed his own version of this headset, named the OQPNVG, in a blog post on 6th November, to coincide with the day the events of Sword Art Online begin. (@SAO_IRL on Twitter is dedicated to broadcasting the events of the series as if it was actually happening, if a murder headset isn&#x27;t enough realism for you.)

                              <span>Ahead of its release tomorrow, Sony Santa Monica has shared the first set of patch notes for God of War Ragnarök.


There are a myriad of fixes addressed in this day one patch, ranging from the UI to the combat. 


Some of the fixes detailed within this update from the developer include a variety of quest, creature, and ability names. Therefore, if you are keen to avoid as many potential spoilers as possible, I would advise not reading the full notes. However, Sony Santa Monica &quot;strongly&quot; encourages everyone to download this patch before playing the game.

The change is one of dozens detailed in Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s patch notes for Update 1.61, which is now rolling out to PC, consoles and even Stadia.


This update is mostly centred around fixing bugs in the game - such as issues with Xbox saves not transferring properly to PC and PlayStation, plus an issue on PC where the game&#x27;s frame rate would drop after exiting a menu.

The news was revealed by our partner site GamesIndustry.biz, and it sees an end to a series that debuted in 2015 - though one whose roots go back much further as a crowdfunded project brought to life by its community. 


Bandai Namco went on to publish the first three games in the series, with Project Cars 3 releasing in 2020 - several months after EA had acquired Slightly Mad Studios as part of its takeover of Codemasters.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s take a moment to mark the passing of another set of driving games - delisted from sale due to the expiry of in-game car licenses. 


The past two months have seen both Project Cars and Project Cars 2 disappear forever. The first game lasted longer - slightly - until 3rd October. Project Cars 2 was removed from sale on 21st September.


In a statement posted to Twitter, developer Slightly Mad Studios blamed &quot;expiring car and track licenses&quot;, but said existing owners would still be able to play both games, and multiplayer servers would remain available.

                              <span>Take-Two has delivered its latest financial report, and revealed that Grand Theft Auto 5 only shipped around 1m units this quarter. 


While this may still seem an impressive figure, it is a marked decrease from previous quarters and the lowest quarter in shipments that Grand Theft Auto 5 has had since its release in 2013. For comparison, in February of this year, the publisher shared it had sold 5m copies between then and the previous November. 


Even with this slow down in sales, the publisher stated the game has now sold more than 170m units worldwide.

                              <span>Even more evidence of a PC release of PS5 exclusive Returnal has emerged, further cementing its long-rumoured existence.

In May, the first signs of a PC release popped up on SteamDB, under the name Oregon. In September, what appeared to be footage of Returnal running on a PC dev kit was spotted by Digital Foundry&#x27;s Alex Battaglia during a GDC talk.

The most recent evidence of a PC port comes from the Oregon listing on SteamDB.

                              <span>Where on earth is that delayed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake? It&#x27;s a question Ubisoft seemingly gets quite a bit, as it has now published an official FAQ page to explain what exactly is going on. 


For those closely following news around the announcement of the remake and its subsequent delays, there&#x27;s not a lot new here. The game is still very much alive, Ubisoft promises, albeit no longer at its original development studio.


Still, the page is a handy place for fans to go for a bit of reassurance. Ubisoft has a habit of delaying games for years - looking at you Skull and Bones, and you Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, and you Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - without providing much proof they still exist.

Sega posted the announcement yesterday, ahead of Sonic Frontiers&#x27; release today, to inform players how to access the DLC.

&quot;DLC content will not be valid if installed after the tutorial area,&quot; Sega tweeted.

                              <span>Nintendo has reported a slowdown in Nintendo Switch console sales, and a slight reduction in its annual sales forecast.


Overall, Nintendo Switch has now sold 114.3m consoles worldwide, with another 6.68m sold over the last two quarters. 2.23m of these were of the original 2017 Switch, while Switch OLED sold 3.53m and Switch Lite sold 920k.


However, Nintendo admitted it had sold 19.2 percent fewer consoles year-on-year over the financial year so far - in part, it said, due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. In response, Nintendo has cut its Switch sales forecast for the year from 21m to 19m consoles.

The scientists tested the exploit by modifying an off-the-shelf drone to create a flying scanning device, the Wi-Peep. The robotic aircraft sends several messages to each device as it flies around, establishing the positions of devices in each room. A thief using the drone could find vulnerable areas in a home or office by checking for the absence of security cameras and other signs that a room is monitored or occupied. It could also be used to follow a security guard, or even to help rival hotels spy on each other by gauging the number of rooms in use...</span>

                              <span>Activision has detailed more of its plans for Call of Duty in 2023, saying next year will bring the series&#x27; &quot;next full premium release&quot; - a statement initially appearing to contradict previous reports there&#x27;d be no brand-new Call of Duty title in 2023.


According to Activision&#x27;s newly revealed third quarter financial results, 2023 will bring &quot;the most robust Call of Duty live operations to date, the next full premium release in the blockbuster annual series, and even more engaging free-to-play experiences across platforms&quot;.


It&#x27;s the talk of the &quot;next full premium release&quot; that&#x27;s caught people&#x27;s attention, particularly in light of claims made by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier in February that Call of Duty wouldn&#x27;t be getting a new mainline series entry in 2023 - marking the first time in just under two decades it had skipped an annual release. Schreier then expanded on those assertions last month, saying Activision would instead be &quot;selling new stuff&quot; for Modern Warfare 2 - &quot;an expansion or something like that&quot; including &quot;campaign stuff&quot;.

                              <span>Over a decade and a half after a live-action Gears of War movie was first touted, Netflix has announced it&#x27;s adapting The Coalition&#x27;s cover shooter series for the small screen.


A Gear of War movie was first trumpeted back in 2007, when New Line Cinema purchased the rights for a live-action adaptation. However, its originally planned 2009 release date came and went, and the project has bounced around in development hell ever since - last resurfacing in 2019 when it was reported it would no longer even be set in the same universe as the games.


Whatever happened to that version of the adaptation, we may never know, as Netflix - on this, the 16th anniversary of the original Gears of War&#x27;s release - has now announced a new partnership with current franchise stewards The Coalition.

                              <span>Dead Cells, the acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, has thrown open its doors to welcome another batch of familiar gaming faces - from indie favourites including Hotline Miami, Shovel Knight, Terraria, and Slay the Spire - in its new Everyone is Here Vol. 2 update on PC.


A follow-up to last year&#x27;s first Everyone is Here update - which featured crossovers with Hollow Knight, Hyper Light Drifter, Blasphemous, Guacamelee, Curse of the Dead Gods, and Skul: The Hero Slayer - Vol. 2 features guest appearances from another six titles.


Up first is Yacht Club Games&#x27; beloved retro platformer Shovel Knight - no stranger to crossovers and cameos - whose Dead Cells appearance takes the form of a new outfit and an accompanying Brutality weapon known as the King Scepter. THis lets players mimic King Knight, dashing around and bouncing on enemies&#x27; heads.

                              <span>Indie hit Stray has been given a Game Boy-inspired makeover by some retro-loving animators. 


Youtube channel 64 Bits has released a demake video showing what Stray would look like if it had been released on a Game Boy. This includes textures and sounds, and to be honest, it looks great! 


The video itself offers a &#x27;highlight reel&#x27; of Stray&#x27;s opening chapters. It shows the titular stray cat&#x27;s sudden separation from their clowder, and their descent into the chasm leading to an unpopulated underground city.

                              <span>BioWare has issued a small teaser and brief update on the status of its next Mass Effect game, in celebration of the franchise&#x27;s annual N7 Day today,  7th November. 


A blog update from BioWare states that &quot;pre-production development has been proceeding very well&quot; as Mass Effect franchise veterans and newcomers work together to craft &quot;characters and locations that you&#x27;ll love, as well as revisiting many that you&#x27;ll remember&quot;. 


That last line stuck out to me, as fan speculation continues on what to expect from this new entry into the franchise. From the off, in BioWare&#x27;s 2020 reveal trailer for the project, fans were greeted by an older version of Liara - apparently centuries older than she appeared in the series&#x27; original trilogy. But that teaser also included hints we&#x27;d hear more about what&#x27;s been going on in Andromeda - the setting for the series&#x27; most recent entry - as well.

A questionnaire on the Xbox Insider app, spotted by Windows Central, is gauging the potential popularity of new energy efficiency features on PC and console.



That includes the possibility of in-game features that can optimise settings (resolution, frame rate, etc) to save energy, and games automatically lowering frame rate or resolution when left idle or inactive.

The Easter egg in question is written in very, very, small text, and can be found on the side of one of the map&#x27;s exhibits. 


While at first glance it may simply look like standard and somewhat generic writing informing in-game tourists about this and that, it is actually a note from one of the game&#x27;s texture artists masquerading as part of the exhibition.

                              <span>The next Nintendo Indie World presentation will be broadcast this week, on Wednesday 9th November at 5pm UK time. You should expect around 25 minutes of trailers and updates on Switch indie games, Nintendo has said.


These official Nintendo shows typically feature a range of smaller Nintendo Switch games - so don&#x27;t go in expecting to see Zelda or F-Zero.


High up on many fans&#x27; wishlists will likely be Hollow Knight: Silksong, which currently sits with a vague release window of... sometime in the next eight months. Will we see it this week? There&#x27;s only one way to find out.

                              <span>There&#x27;s an official Stranger Things VR game on the way from developer Tender Claws.


Made in collaboration with Netlflix and the series&#x27; writers, this upcoming release will put players into the shoes of season four&#x27;s main antagonist Vecna as he &quot;explores unknown realities, forms the hive mind, and enacts his plan for revenge against Eleven and Hawkins&quot;. 


All of this revenge planning and hive mind forming will see Vecna invading the memories and dreams of other characters from the show. This in turn will provide the ability for players to &quot;harness telekinetic powers to battle humans and creatures alike&quot;. You can see a teaser for this upcoming release below.

But it turns out he was almost cast as Geralt of Rivia in 2018 when the role was first being cast. 


According to a report by redanianintelligence, Hemsworth was actually a frontrunner for the part before the role ultimately went to Cavill.

                              <span>Microsoft has commented on the ongoing issues affecting Halo Infinite after its arrival late last year - after which, it says, the game &quot;fell short&quot; by not being able to satisfy players. 


Speaking to the Friends Per Second Podcast, Microsoft&#x27;s Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty praised the team which launched Halo Infinite after working through the pandemic to get the game done - but also admitted Microsoft had fallen short with its support for the game after its arrival.


&quot;In December I think we had a peak of around 20 million players playing the game, and just kudos to the team for building and shipping a game during some pretty challenging times, right?&quot; Booty said. &quot;Last year - still in the midst of the pandemic, still everybody trying to figure out how to adapt to remote work and hybird work. I think if there&#x27;s a worse-case condition for trying to get games done, it is the big multi-hundred person team trying to final a game. It went smack into that. So, kudos to shipping it.

                              <span>Riot has admitted to censoring League of Legends characters in certain countries, in the wake of releasing its first gay Black hero.


K&#x27;Sante is the latest champion to be added to the game, which had its Worlds 2022 tournament this weekend featuring a performance from rapper Lil Nas X.


Yet the game&#x27;s executive producer has admitted the developer would replace certain words such as &quot;lover&quot; and &quot;partner&quot; in countries with poor LGBT+ rights.

                              <span>Battlefield 1 became the most popular Battlefield game on Steam over the past week, thanks to a hefty discount.

The sale, which began on 1st November, takes a whopping 88 percent off the game&#x27;s usual price and it&#x27;s clearly led to a resurgence of players.

The six-year old game is now well ahead of last year&#x27;s beleagured Battlefield 2042 and 2018&#x27;s Battlefield 5 as the most popular game from the series on Steam.

                              <span>I have been meaning to write about Joe Sullivan, Uber’s former Chief Security Officer. He was convicted of crimes related to covering up a cyberattack against Uber. It’s a complicated case, and I’m not convinced that he deserved a guilty ruling or that it’s a good thing for the industry.
I may still write something, but until then, this essay on the topic is worth reading.</span>

The new Ghost type Pokémon - which recently popped up, albeit in an uncatchable form, in Pokémon Go earlier this week - is now making its debut in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. You&#x27;ll be able to find them in the Paldea region. 

Here&#x27;s a brief video showing them in action (click to watch on YouTube if the embed isn&#x27;t working!):

As spotted by Indiewire, Lionsgate&#x27;s CEO recently addressed investors and confirmed that the team was &quot;fielding proposals&quot; about a &quot;AAA&quot; John Wick game to expand the multimillion dollar series beyond Hollywood movies.

Although no concrete details were shared, Jon Feltheimer said that Lionsgate &quot;believe there is a big AAA game to be made out of John Wick&quot; but didn&#x27;t &quot;want to say anything more&quot; right now.

                              <span>Rumour has it, Blizzard may be set to release Diablo 4 in April 2023.

That&#x27;s according to the XboxEra podcast and Windows Central, both of which believe Diablo 4&#x27;s tentative &quot;2023&quot; release window can be narrowed down to April, with early access reportedly launching in February, and pre-orders going live as early as next month. 

It&#x27;s thought more news will come during December&#x27;s The Game Awards, which certainly sounds plausible enough. Thankfully, we won&#x27;t have long to wait to test if the rumours are true; the Awards are set for 8th December which is just a few short weeks away now.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer says &quot;what could happen&quot; with older Activision Blizzard franchises like StarCraft is &quot;pretty exciting&quot;.

Asked what could be on the horizon should Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition go ahead, Spencer added that he was &quot;excited about getting to sit down with the teams at Activision and Blizzard and King to talk about back catalogue and opportunities that we might have&quot;.

&quot;The first thing I would say is, I&#x27;m not allowed to make any decisions about what happens at Blizzard or Activision or King,&quot; Spencer told Wired (via NME). &quot;So this is all just kind of talking and thinking about what the opportunity is.

                              <span>Riot Games has teamed with GGTEch and NUEL to launch Rising Stars, a new women&#x27;s League of Legends standalone tournament.

In a bid to &quot;promote inclusion and opportunities in esports&quot;, Riot says each competing team is &quot;required to be entirely composed of women&quot; aged at least 16 years old. 

An online tournament for teams from across Europe - albeit one &quot;primarily geared toward participants from the UK, Ireland, and the Nordics&quot; - is scheduled to take place on 26th and 27th November, and played on the EUWest server. Participants require a League of Legends account &quot;in good standing&quot; and will battle for their share of a £3000 prize pool. Registration closes on 22nd November.

                              <span>A Modern Warfare 2 promotional campaign that gives a double XP code to US players in exchange for buying Jack Link&#x27;s Pork Strips has caused a bit of a kerfuffle after purchasers realised that many have unwittingly bought packs after the codes were stolen.

As spotted by PC Gamer, rather than hide the code inside the packaging, Jack Link&#x27;s Spicy Dill Pickle Pork Strips chose to add the code in a tiny little pamphlets glued onto the front. However, it looks like douchbags like this dude are going around and stealing them.

&quot;On the ground reporting from Walmart on the Jack Links beef jerky double XP codes for Modern Warfare 2 being stolen from every store I can find,&quot; reported COD content creator, Modern Warzone.

Launching alongside Season 2, the new hero - a tank from the same brotherhood of monks as Zenyatta - is reportedly designed to hold off other tanks in a bid to improve the free-to-play shooter&#x27;s combat balance.

Ramattra has two forms; the defensive Omnic form, and Nemesis, which is just as aggressive as it sounds.

Whilst the &quot;fresh&quot; part of the moniker suggests this is a deal that should primarily interest lapsed players, Amazon says the &quot;new servers will offer old and new players a chance to completely restart their New World experience as pre-existing high-level characters cannot be transferred in&quot;.

&quot;It’s a great opportunity for new and lapsed players to experience all that has changed over the game&#x27;s first year,&quot; the team said.

                              <span>Bayonetta 3 was reportedly &quot;scoped as a semi open-world game&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to games journalist Imran Khan, who offered an insider peek at the sequel&#x27;s lengthy delay on his Patreon, reflecting on why those open world rumours seemingly didn&#x27;t amount to anything in the end. 

&quot;At one point in development, Bayonetta 3 was scoped as a semi-open world game,&quot; Khan wrote on a public Patreon post. &quot;The design was going to draw more off Astral Chain than Nier Automata, but the idea was that a large hub world would send Bayonetta (or whoever else) to different worlds which would themselves be fairly open. Maybe Super Mario 64 would be a good reference point for this.

&quot;Here is our updated Roadmap for Early Access!&quot; exclaims Wales Interactive. &quot;It does not list everything we are working on (we have to keep some things a surprise!) and is only a response to the majority of features requested in the Steam Forum, Steam Reviews and on the Discord.&quot;

The studio adds that the list &quot;doesn&#x27;t include many of the on-going development such as new episodes (and the base content released for each episode), optimisation, network improvements, balancing, UI and QOL etc&quot; and confirms that the ping system, re-roll miracles, POV increase, enemy-auto-respawn times reduction and XP levels have already been addressed.

In a statement shared across its social media channels, the developer said that because of said confusion, it has &quot;decided to reward&quot; all Vault Edition owners - current and prospective - 10 hours of double XP tokens and 10 hours of double weapon XP tokens.

&quot;We understand there has been some confusion about an in-game-store exclusive award for the Vault Edition,&quot; the statement reads.

                              <span>Geri &quot;Ginger Spice&quot; Halliwell-Horner and Djimon Hounsou have been cast in Sony&#x27;s upcoming Gran Turismo movie.

The former is interesting not just because of her &quot;rare narrative screen appearance&quot;, as The Hollywood Reporter puts it, but also because the Spice girl is married to team principal of Red Bull&#x27;s Formula One team, Christian Horner.

Sony&#x27;s live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Stranger Things&#x27; David Harbour was the first member of the cast to be officially revealed with the news he&#x27;ll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who&#x27;s helming the project.

                              <span>A brand-new Pokémon - first teased in October&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet trailer - has been datamined following the latest update to Pokémon Go.


Sharp-eyed fans first spotted the mysterious new Pokémon during a segment on Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s photo mode, its round grey head and twin antenna barely visible behind a chunk of UI.


There&#x27;ve been no further sightings following that discovery, and developer GameFreak is yet to reveal more, but a new Pokémon Go update has now, albeit inadvertently, kicked the little fella into the spotlight sooner than intended.

                              <span>Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Capcom&#x27;s stupendous 2011 paranormal puzzle adventure about posessing inanimate objects, might be making a comeback, with the South Korean ratings board having now listed it for release on PC.


Ghost Trick, for those unlucky enough to have never made its aquaintance, was created by Shu Takumi, best known as the designer of Capcom&#x27;s much-loved Ace Attorney series. It follows the adventures of Sissel, who wakes at the beginning of the game in spirit form, inches from his corpse, with little recollection of his past. It soon transpires, though, that while Sissel has lost his memories, he&#x27;s gained some new abilities - ghost tricks, you might say! - in their place. 


From that point on, progress is generally made by watching scenes play out - Ghost Trick has a wonderfully engaging story - then rewinding back to figure out a way of influencing events to change their outcome, usually by possessing different items around the evironment and then bringing them to life at the right moment.

The Pastel Pop Kit ushers in a selection of home furnishings and decorative additions - including mirrors, shelves, and desk items - with a focus on the &quot;simple and psychedelic&quot;. That means &quot;quirky pastel prints, irregular shapes, and vintage vibes&quot; inspired by 60s and 70s design.


Next week&#x27;s second DLC, the Everyday Clutter Kit, does pretty much exactly what it says in the title, introducing items that can be used to give homes a &quot;loved and lived-in&quot; look - ranging from coffee mugs to magazine stacks.

                              <span>SNK&#x27;s second Neo Geo Pocket Color compilation for Switch and PC - which the publisher is sensibly calling Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection V2 - will be making its way to Steam and Nintendo&#x27;s eShop next Wednesday 9th November. 


As with volume 1, which released last September, this second collection bundles together 10 gaming favourites from SNK&#x27;s short-lived but much-loved Neo Geo Pocket.


Somewhat unhelpfully, SNK is yet to announce what those 10 games will be, but sharp-eyed readers with better SNK knowledge than me might find some clues in the accompanying announcement artwork below. Inevitably, there&#x27;s no pricing details yet either, but expect it to be similar to volume 1, available on Steam and eShop for £29.99/£35.99 respectively.

Celebrating the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, Insomniac Games senior community manager Aaron Jason Espinoza announced today on the PlayStation Blog that five more games will be added to the subscription service.



Sadly that doesn&#x27;t include the duo&#x27;s latest PS5 adventure, which released in June 2021 and was considered something of a showpiece for the console.

                              <span>Little Inferno is a smart indie puzzle game about putting things in a fireplace and watching them burn, with a clever story about commercialisation. 10 years later, it&#x27;s getting an expansion.


It&#x27;s been a long time coming - so long, the Ho Ho Holiday expansion (available to wishlist on Steam and Epic) will now reach us at a time we can&#x27;t afford to heat our actual homes. 


On a brighter note, Ho Ho Holiday adds a new story, 20 more toys to put in your fireplace, and 50 fresh combinations to uncover as you incinerate certain objects at the same time.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 director Naoki Yoshida has addressed the lack of diversity in Final Fantasy 16, specifically the lack of both ethnic diversity and women.


Speaking to IGN, Yoshida was asked to comment on responses to the latest trailer that features mostly white characters.


Yoshida admitted it was a difficult question to answer, but that the lack of diversity fits the &quot;isolated nature of this realm&quot; - Valisthea, where the game takes place.

                              <span>A leaked video reportedly showing footage from Hideo Kojima&#x27;s next project is currently circulating on social media. A title card shown at the end of the video labels it as &quot;A Hideo Kojima Game&quot; with the apparent title of &quot;Overdose&quot;.


The two-and-a-half-minute footage shows an in-game scene with a character who looks a lot like Margaret Qualley - someone fans will recognise from her role as Mama in Kojima&#x27;s previous game Death Stranding. 


The video looks as if it was originally designed for internal use, as it also features a feed of someone apparently playing the scene. All of this has then been videoed by someone else, off of a very reflective screen which shows the man taping the footage to be lying in bed half-naked. Lovely.

In its latest blog post, developer Bungie states that a &quot;notable&quot; number of PlayStation 5 players are actually still playing the PS4 version.



A PS5 and Xbox Series X/S upgrade was released for the game back in 2020, offering improved visuals and framerates.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid maker Hideo Kojima has said his development studio will remain independent - despite numerous offers from interested parties. 


The past year has seen a flurry of mergers and acquisitions within the video game industry, with Microsoft following up its Bethesda purchase by launching its attempt to buy Activision Blizzard, while Sony has gobbled up Bungie and Take-Two has taken on Zynga.


Don&#x27;t expect the Death Stranding developer to follow suit, however - even as Kojima looks to be building new games for both Microsoft and Sony.

Considering there&#x27;s other, more recent online shooters most people are playing (cough cough, Overwatch 2 and Modern Warfare 2, cough), Filament is the star of this week&#x27;s choices, but not without its own reasons.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima has addressed the persistant internet rumours that he has something to do with PlayStation 5 vapourware project Abandoned. 


Blue Box, the developer of Abandoned, gained internet fame for continually teasing that there was more to its survival horror game than met the eye. Fans pounced on the suggestion it was linked to Kojima, or was one of the many Silent Hill projects in production. Neither is the case.


&quot;Users just kept sending me pictures of this Hasan [Kahraman, Abandoned&#x27;s creator]. They still send me collages and deepfake images - like 20 a day. It&#x27;s really quite a nuisance! [laughs] This has been going on for almost two years now,&quot; Kojima said, speaking in the latest episode of his Spotify podcast.

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers leaks have emerged ahead of its release next week.


As the prologue comic and animation suggest, Sonic Frontiers is a more story-driven adventure than you might expect, so this is your notice to watch out for spoilers online.



And don&#x27;t worry - we won&#x27;t share any here. Instead, here&#x27;s the latest trailer.

                              <span>In 1878, a 55-foot-long giant squid washed up on the shores of Glover’s Harbour, Newfoundland. It’s the largest giant squid ever recorded—although scientists now think that the size was an exaggeration or the result of postmortem stretching—and there’s a full-sized statue of it near the beach where it was found.
As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Prevention is often seen as the responsibility of the software developer, as they are required to securely develop and deliver code, verify third party components, and harden the build environment. But the supplier also holds a critical responsibility in ensuring the security and integrity of our software. After all, the software vendor is responsible for liaising between the customer and software developer. It is through this relationship that additional security features can be applied via contractual agreements, software releases and updates, notifications and mitigations of vulnerabilities...</span>

This blog post was inspired by a previous Kubernetes blog post about
Advanced Server Side Apply.
The author of said blog post listed multiple benefits for applications and
controllers when switching to server-side apply (from now on abbreviated with
SSA). Especially the chapter about
CI/CD systems
motivated me to respond and write down my thoughts and experiences.
These thoughts and experiences are the results of me working on Kluctl
for the past 2 years. I describe Kluctl as &quot;The missing glue to put together
large Kubernetes deployments, composed of multiple smaller parts
(Helm/Kustomize/...) in a manageable and unified way.&quot;
To get a basic understanding of Kluctl, I suggest to visit the kluctl.io
website and read through the documentation and tutorials, for exampl…</span>

                              <span>Frogwares has shared a first gameplay trailer for its upcoming remake of Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened - the studio&#x27;s Lovecraft-themed crossover from 2007 - alongside news that the project will be launching early next year.


Frogwares revealed its plans for a &quot;full remake and substantial rewrite&quot; of The Awakened back in July, launching a Kickstarter campaign shortly after to secure additional funding to complete the game - a step the Ukranian studio said was necessary due to complications arising from Russia&#x27;s ongoing invasion. 


Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, in its new guise, will rework the events of the original to serve as a continuation of the studio&#x27;s young Sherlock arc, which began in last year&#x27;s enjoyable Chapter One. As such, it&#x27;ll follow a young Sherlock Holmes, along with his new acquaintance John Watson, on his first big case in London - an investigation soon leading to a Cthulhu-worshipping cult and other Lovecraft-inspired horrors.

Schachner - whose extensive CV includes composing credits on the likes of Anthem, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare - was widely praised for her work on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare&#x27;s soundtrack in 2019.


Schachner returned for this year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2, but has now confirmed she won&#x27;t be providing any further music for the title - or indeed Call of Duty: Warzone - as a result of seemingly insurmountable work concerns.

                              <span>This year marks the tenth anniversary of Double Fine and iam8bit&#x27;s Day of the Devs indie showcase, and organisers are celebrating that milestone this Saturday, 5th November, with a big in-person event. Ahead of that, though, we got a taste of some of the titles that&#x27;ll be in attendance courtesy of a brand-new Day of the Devs livestream. You&#x27;ll find everything that got an airing - some of it new, some of it not - detailed below, but if anything takes your fancy, it&#x27;s worth checking out the livestream, which contains plenty of new footage from each game.

Mina the Hollower


Mina the Hollower is Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games&#x27; latest retro-inspired project, a challenging action-adventure RPG inspired by the Game Boy Colour. Landing somewhere between Link&#x27;s Awakening and Bloodborne, it&#x27;s &quot;a bone chilling new adventure&quot; starring a whip-wielding inventor mouse whose attacks are intentionally slow - meaning spacing and timing is crucial during combat. Mina also has a signature burrowing technique preventing her from being damaged when underground, and an upgrade system that requires collecting bones from defeated enemies to level up different skills. There&#x27;s no release date for Mina the Hollower yet, but it&#x27;s currently &quot;deep in development&quot;.

                              <span>AMD has revealed its first RDNA 3 graphics cards, the $1000 Radeon RX 7900 XTX and $900 RX 7900 XT. As the numbering scheme and price points indicate, these are high-end models designed to compete with Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 4090 and 4080, but they come with more substantial changes than you might expect - including FSR 3, designed to counter Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS 3 frame generation, and a brand new chiplet-based design.


Before we get into the features though, let&#x27;s take a look at the cards themselves. The chiplet design breaks a traditional monolithic GPU into several interconnected sections. For RDNA 3, that&#x27;s a single 5nm graphics compute die (GCD) that&#x27;s 300mm² and six 6nm memory cache dies (MCDs) that are each 37mm². This design means that only the most critical areas need to be made with a cutting-edge 5nm process, helping to improve CPU yields, reducing costs and ultimately consumer prices. However, it also requires a fast interconnect between the different chips - which runs at 5.3TB/s here. This same chiplet approach worked brilliantly with Ryzen, transforming AMD from an also-run to a growing giant, so it&#x27;ll be fascinating to see how it if works miracles in the GPU space too.


Each of the dies are impressive in their own right. The memory cache die uses a 64-bit memory controller and a second-gen Infinity Cache, which combine to provide 2.7 times the peak bandwidth of RDNA2 designs. Meanwhile, the graphics compute die offers unified RDNA 3 compute units with hardware for stream processing, AI acceleration and RT. The design also decouples shader and front end clocks speed, with 2.3GHz for the former and 2.5GHz for the latter, which AMD says will result in a more efficient design - with up to 25 percent power savings in terms of shaders and 15 percent higher front-end clock frequency.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to Sony&#x27;s eye-opening announcement of its PlayStation VR2 pricing, alongside Eurogamer&#x27;s resident VR superfan and advocate Ian Higton as a special guest.

The PSVR2 is a high-end device and it was never going to be cheap, but its £530 cost (£570 if you actually also want something to play) has placed it out of reach for many console players  - let alone those without a PS5 already. Of the many headset options available, Sony&#x27;s was expected to be the most likely to attract a wider audience and grow the budding VR scene. But with that price, and a line-up of games you can mostly play elsewhere, why not choose another option - if you are interested in VR at all? 
Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Ishraq Subhan join Ian and me as we discuss why the headset costs so much, what Sony could do to sweeten the deal, and what future we think PSVR2 now has at that price point.

                              <span>Using attachments in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 might actually be making weapons worse, players believe. 


Filling up attachment slots was common advice for previous Call of Duty games, since the drawbacks were negligible compared to the benefits. 


But the community now thinks filling up all five attachment slots in MW2 may not be optimal, with drawbacks for many attachments not outweighing the benefits.

We were originally expecting Blood Bowl 3 back in August 2021, though its claret-filled casualties failed to turn up on time. Nacon belatedly confirmed it had delayed the project, blaming production delays due to the pandemic.


A further delay last year saw Blood Bowl 3 pushed to a late 2022 launch. Here&#x27;s hoping today&#x27;s final revision to February 2023 is the one that now sticks.

                              <span>Final Fantasy maker Square Enix has announced Symbiogenesis, an interactive NFT project.


Symbiogenesis will launch in spring next year as a browser-based game for PC and mobile, Square Enix announced today, and be a new &quot;franchise&quot; for the company which will use the Ethereum blockchain.


Characters from the game will be able to collect as digital art. There&#x27;s also an interactive story where players can &quot;untangle a mystery by completing missions&quot;. There&#x27;s no explanation of why this incorporates NFTs at all.

                              <span>This is just a quick little public service announcement, as it looks like Subnautica will leave Xbox Game Pass this month. 
Its removal has not been previously announced by Xbox, as the departures of other games leaving its subscription service in October have. Still, the game now features on the &#x27;Leaving Soon&#x27; section for the service.
Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for clarification.

Sharing the milestone on Twitter, publisher Focus Entertainment thanked all those who had embarked on this &quot;incredible journey with Amicia and Hugo&quot; so far.
A Plague Tale: Requiem released on 18th October for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X (as well as on Xbox Game Pass), and Nintendo Switch via cloud play. Today&#x27;s figure includes players from all of these platforms, and doesn&#x27;t break anything out in terms of full sales.

                              <span>Modders have been adding weapons from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 into Fallout 4, ensuring the guns feel the same down to every detail. 


As well as the weapon model itself, sounds, animations, and customisability have all been ported over from MW2. The end result is a group of weapons that feel incredibly realistic in a game where weapon feel isn&#x27;t a strong point. 


Current weapons available to download are the M4 assault rifle and Signal 50 sniper rifle, with plans to add more down the line.

                              <span>PlayStation fans are now manually listing the games leaving PlayStation Plus, as Sony removes its Last Chance to Play tab.


Last week we reported that Sony had seemingly removed expiry dates from PS Plus, with only one game listed in the Last Chance to Play tab.


Now that tab has disappeared. Rez, the only game in the tab at the time of writing, is still currently listed as a PS Plus game, but without an expiry date.

It was previously revealed that players will soon be able to earn XP just through playing, but now we have more detail.


When this update goes live on 8th November, Halo Infinite&#x27;s &quot;Match XP Beta&quot; will see players rewarded for playing &quot;whatever mode they want&quot;.

                              <span>Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard has filed a last-minute attempt to delay the counting of votes from some of its workers seeking to form a union.


Last month, Blizzard&#x27;s Albany-based band of Diablo testers formally  won the right to form a union following a months-long process. Ballots were subsequently sent out, with the result due to be announced on 18th November. 


Now, Activision Blizzard has entered a motion to impound those ballots, GamesIndustry.biz reports. The company&#x27;s top brass is currently appealing the Diablo testers&#x27; ability to unionise, and claims any announcement of the results would prejudice future results.

Reddit user InterventX shared a mockup of what a more functional user interface would look like, which as it turns out just looks like the interface from Modern Warfare (2019). 


Eagle-eyed fans have pointed out Infinity Ward got a new UX/UI Director following Modern Warfare&#x27;s launch in 2019. William Faler joined the studio in October 2020, having previously been the head of UX at the American streaming platform Hulu.

                              <span>New evidence has been discovered that points towards PVP  DLC coming to Elden Ring.


As found by dataminer Sekiro Dubi, the latest update to the game includes data for text banners that read &quot;You Win&quot;, &quot;You Lose&quot;, &quot;Draw&quot;, and &quot;Begin Match&quot;.


Elden Ring players have long speculated on the empty colosseums in the game and the potential for a future PvP mode - is this now on the way? Sekiro Dubi thinks so.

                              <span>Sony has now officially detailed the full suite of graphical options available in God of War Ragnarök across both PlayStation 4 and PS5. 


Some of these we knew already - specifically, the &quot;Favour Resolution&quot; and &quot;Favour Performance&quot; settings on PS5 which you can then modify further by applying the separate High Frame Rate (HFR) Mode. 


Today, Sony has now detailed the potential for VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) to modify these settings even further, and also detailed the various specs you can expect across both PS4 and PS4 Pro. Phew!

                              <span>Ubisoft has finally got around to sharing more concrete information on Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope&#x27;s season pass, which has been available to purchase for some time now, breaking down the three content drops owners will receive throughout 2023.


First up is The Tower of Doooom, planned for launch in &quot;early 2023&quot;. This sees Madame Bwahstrella enlisting Mario, Rabbid Peach, and pals to help save her friend Spawny - a task that&#x27;ll require players to battle their way to the top of the titular tower in what Ubisoft is calling a &quot;highly strategic&quot; new combat game mode.


The Tower of Doooom will be followed by a currently unnamed second DLC instalment in &quot;mid 2023&quot;, taking players to an &quot;enchanting&quot; new planet. Here, they&#x27;ll be able to &quot;explore new environments, meet fun characters, discover secrets, and face off against new enemies.&quot;

In a tweet announcing Modern Warfare 2 ranked play&#x27;s planned release window, the studio said it was working with partners to deliver a number of key features at launch, including competitive modes, competitive rewards, ranked skill divisions, and top 250 leaderboards - with more details to be shared at a later date.


As part of its announcement, Treyarch also confirmed Activision will be terminating league play in Call of Duty: Black Ops - Cold War and ranked play in Call of Duty: Vanguard as of 22nd November this year. It recommended players &quot;grab their rewards&quot; in both games before then.

Switchback is coming from Supermassive Games, and sees players embarking on the most terrifying roller coaster ride I have ever seen. It is all set in the world of The Dark Pictures Anthology, with director Alejandro Arque Gallardo calling it &quot;your own personal nightmare&quot;.

                              <span>Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced a last-minute delay for the PlayStation 5 version of Football Manager 2023, citing &quot;unforeseen complications which have arisen during the submissions and approvals process.&quot;


Football Manager 2023 was to mark the series long-awaited debut on PlayStation 5, with Sport Interactive boss Miles Jacobson having previously blamed its absence on Sony&#x27;s unwillingness to send dev kits to the studio. &quot;To make games for a platform, you need a dev kit,&quot; he explained in 2020. &quot;To get a dev kit, the platform holder has to want the game on the platform. We spoke with Sony, we have no dev kits. We spoke with Microsoft, they sent them to us.&quot;


Football fans with PS5s finally got the news they&#x27;d hoping for earlier this year, when Sports Interactive revealed Football Manager 2023 would be heading to Sony&#x27;s platform on 8th November. Now, however, the studio has been forced to announce an indefinite delay for the title due to &quot;unforeseen complications&quot; relating to Sony&#x27;s submissions and approvals process.

                              <span>An upset Call of Duty player has sparked criticism for turning up in-person at an Activision Blizzard studio to try and get their Modern Warfare 2 ban overturned.


Writing in a now-deleted post on reddit  (thanks, PC Gamer), the first-person shooter fan stated they had been stopped by a security guard after entering the car park of the company&#x27;s office in Austin, Texas on Monday, 31st October. 


The fan says they &quot;politely&quot; asked to be let into the office to complain about their &quot;wrongful&quot; Modern Warfare 2 ban, having spent $140 on a special edition version of the game. The fan was refused entry, and told to wait for customer support to resolve the issue.

In it, the company&#x27;s board of directors advises shareholders to vote against two proposals for independent reports to be conducted into Microsoft&#x27;s military contracts. 

Proposal four, submitted by Boston Common Asset Management and Impact Investors, concerns the ethics of how the US government uses Microsoft&#x27;s technology. Proposal five, submitted by Harrington Investments, cites the potential impacts of being involved with development of weapons for the US military. 
Both proposals include statements made publicly by Microsoft employees about their disagreement on involvement with military contracts.

                              <span>Elite Dangerous and Planet Coaster company Frontier Developments has snapped up Complex Games, the studio behind Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters. 


It&#x27;s the first time the British-based Frontier has acquired a development studio, albeit one which the company has worked with in the past. The well-received Daemonhunters arrived in May this year as part of Frontier&#x27;s own third-party games label. 


Frontier has paid £8.3m upfront, with a further £3.3m due over the next year if milestones are met.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor looks set to launch by the end of March 2023 - even though publisher EA is yet to make it official.


Speaking to investors in a financial briefing last night, EA said it had a &quot;major IP&quot; due to arrive before 31st March next year - but that it was holding off on its big reveal until nearer the time.


The sequel to 2019&#x27;s popular Jedi: Fallen Order is really the only thing on EA&#x27;s slate this &quot;major IP&quot; without a release date could be. We already know the launch dates of EA&#x27;s upcoming Need for Speed return, its Dead Space remake and its collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Wild Hearts.

                              <span>Sony is ramping up the hype for its upcoming Norse epic God of War Ragnarök with some pretty eclectic marketing. 


Yesterday, we got to see Ben Stiller leading a group therapy session with John Travolta, LeBron James and their children, and today we get to witness Japan&#x27;s newest Ragnarök trailer.


This trailer is an upbeat little number complete with its own (quite catchy) song and dance routine. The parent in me likens it to Australian children&#x27;s music group The Wiggles, but with weapons added in to give it that bit extra. It is quite something, and I sort of love it. See it for yourself below.

FIFA 23 is the final footballing game from EA to feature the famous FIFA branding. It will also benefit from modes reflecting the upcoming 2022 and 2023 World Cups in Qatar and Australia/New Zealand. The first of those arrives next week for all major platforms except Nintendo Switch.


EA previously boasted FIFA 23 had been a &quot;record-breaking&quot; release for the series, hitting 10.3 million players in its first week, making it the &quot;biggest launch period in EA Sports FIFA franchise history&quot;.

                              <span>A new Deus Ex title is reportedly in the works at Embracer Group&#x27;s recently acquired Eidos-Montréal studio, albeit one that&#x27;s still in the &quot;very very early&quot; stages of development.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, who made the claim in a tweet accompanying today&#x27;s news of Square Enix Montréal&#x27;s closure.


Although no further details on the new Deus Ex project were shared, this would seemingly be the first known instance of a major Square Enix IP being revived under Embracer Group&#x27;s watch since it acquired the likes of Tomb Raider, Thief, and Deus Ex - plus Square Enix Montréal, Eidos-Montréal, and Crystal Dynamics - as part of a $300m deal in May.

                              <span>Embracer Group is closing its down Square Enix Montréal studio - which it purchased as part of a $300m USD deal with Square Enix back in May - just weeks after rebranding it Studio Onoma.


In its Square Enix Montréal guise, Onama was a predominantly mobile-focused developer, perhaps best known for its Go series of puzzles games. It was working on Tomb Raider Reloaded, Avatar Generations, and a new Space Invaders game when it was acquired by Embracer Group alongside Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal in May.


As reported by Bloomberg, however, Embracer Group today informed staff it will be closing the studio in a move the company says will affect around 200 employees. Bloomberg&#x27;s sources claim some members of the Onama team will be transferred to Eidos-Montréal, although it&#x27;s unclear how many employees will be left without jobs following today&#x27;s news.

                              <span>A little over a week after Jodie Whittaker&#x27;s Doctor Who regeneration thrust David Tennant upon us again, everybody&#x27;s favourite Time Lord (not including Missy, obviously) has materialised in Mediatonic&#x27;s knockabout battle royale game Fall Guys for a spot of cross-promotional fun.


From today, 1st November, until Sunday, 6th November, players can find four Doctor-Who-themed costume sets in Fall Guys&#x27; premium item shop, costing 800 Show-Bucks apiece.


There&#x27;s one inspired by Tom Baker&#x27;s legendary fourth Doctor, one based on Jodie Whittaker&#x27;s incarnation, and a third modelled after the latest David Tennant regeneration - which the BBC is officially referring to as the Fourteenth Doctor - as seen at the end of showrunner Chris Chibnall&#x27;s recent swansong The Power of the Doctor.

                              <span>Kojima Productions has revealed Japanese-Australian actress Shioli Kutsuna will star in its upcoming, and for now somewhat mysterious, new game.


Kutsuna  is best known for her role as Yukio in Deadpool 2, and has also had roles in Murder Mystery and The Outsider.


This news came in true Kojima style. As with the earlier reveals of Elle Fanning&#x27;s participation in this new game, Kutsuna&#x27;s role was shared on Kojima&#x27;s website.

This version of the game will be sold for $30, and include a slightly-less-old pixel art style to make the whole thing a little easier on the eye. 
There&#x27;ll also be a &quot;new helpful tutorial&quot; to assist new players into Dwarf Fortress&#x27; labyrinthine ways, as well as a fresh soundtrack and UI.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s release is just around the corner and, in anticipation of this, Sony has released a new live-action trailer for its Norse epic. 


The trailer in question sees Ben Stiller (yes, of Dodgeball fame) dressed up as Kratos, as he leads a group therapy session with John Travolta, LeBron James and their children. Apparently, the father and son relationship we see in God of War between Kratos and Atreus is key to these famous faces nurturing their own parent-child bonds.


The resulting trailer is described as &quot;a Super Bowl-level spot&quot;, which you can see below.

                              <span>Kelsey Danger, community manager for Pokémon Go, has reported receiving &quot;violent threats&quot; following discussion of a recent bug within the game. 


Fixing the bug involved Pokémon Go developer Niantic briefly disabling the game&#x27;s Bluetooth device support - used by auto-catching accessories such as the officially-licensed Go Plus device and unofficial Gotcha wristband.


Support for these gadgets was re-enabled this morning when the bug was fixed, following a weekend of fan fury directed at Danger.

As with recent versions of FIFA on Nintendo Switch, FIFA 23 on Nintendo Switch is a &quot;Legacy Edition&quot;, which means it includes the same gameplay features from FIFA 22 Legacy Edition without any new development or significant enhancements.

A post on Reddit detailing a message from Nacon&#x27;s customer support claims the publisher made an error advertising the upgrade.


&quot;We inform you that the developers confirm that if you bought the version of the video game for PS4 it is not possible to update the video game for the PS5 version,&quot; Nacon explained in a reply to one owner of a PS4 version of the game.

Mei, one of the game&#x27;s damage characters, has an ability called Ice Wall, which projects a huge wall of ice in front of her.

Ice Wall is a useful ability which can block the opposing team&#x27;s path and line of sight. Players found a novel way to use it, but not without some bugs.

In its first three days, the blockbuster game generated $800m worldwide. According to Activision&#x27;s numbers makes it the highest grossing piece of entertainment all year, more than 2022&#x27;s biggest films Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Top Gun: Maverick combined.


The previous opening record was held by 2011&#x27;s Modern Warfare 3, which made $775m worldwide over five days. The latest game beat this record in just three.

                              <span>Return to Monkey Island will launch on Xbox via Game Pass, Microsoft has confirmed. 


The newly-launched entry in the classic adventure game series will arrive for Xbox consoles, cloud and PC via Game Pass on 8th November, following its previous release on PC and Switch.


Our Christian Donlan described the game as &quot;a deft and heartfelt journey through nostalgia&quot; in Eurogamer&#x27;s Return to Monkey Island review.

                              <span>I recently got word there was a Monkey Island-like game in the works. This in itself is not exactly unusual - point and click games have always been around, even if they are not as prevalent as they once were. 


But this Monkey Island-like game has something else going for it that made my ears prick up. Not only is it described as a &quot;merry and macabre point and click adventure game&quot; by its developers, but it also happens to have Jonathan Ackley (Curse of Monkey Island&#x27;s co-director) giving it his seal of approval. Colour me interested!


The game in question is Foolish Mortals, and it comes from the minds at Inklingwood Studios - you can see a teaser for it below. Heavily inspired by the Monkey Island series, this game takes place in an exotic locale and, as luck would have it, there is a demo for it available right now on Steam. So, of course, I headed on over to give this upcoming release a whirl.

                              <span>Microsoft loses up to $200 on each Xbox console it sells.


In an interview with CNBC, Xbox head Phil Spencer admitted its Xbox Series X/S consoles are sold at a loss, with the expectation that revenue will be made up elsewhere on accessories and games.



That&#x27;s $100 lost on the $499 Series X, and $200 on the smaller $299 Series S.

                              <span>Fortnite is hosting a Star Wars week, and introducing skins for Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Han Solo alongside a range of classic trilogy-themed acessories.


Each of the three skins includes multiple designs based on costumes worn throughout the original trilogy - so, Luke in his white farmhand tunic but also his darker Return of the Jedi look, while Leia rocks her bounty hunter disguise as well as her iconic ear buns.


The game&#x27;s ever-popular Lightsaber weapons are back, as is the return of Darth Vader and various Stormtroopers to defeat. In a nice touch, the Junk Rift item (which plummets an object onto a specific location, squashing anyone below it) can now drop Luke&#x27;s landspeeder.

Steam&#x27;s family sharing feature offers users exactly what you would expect. It allows players to share the games in their Steam library with their nearest and dearest. They can then go on to earn their own achievements and save any progress made in a shared game on the Steam Cloud.

                              <span>The number of people subscribed to PlayStation Plus has dropped by two million over the past year, despite Sony&#x27;s big summer revamp of the service and the launch of several new pricing tiers.


PlayStation Plus had  45.4 million subscribers as of 30th September this year, down more than two million from the 47.2 million signed up at the same point in 2021.


Sony relaunched its PlayStation Plus subscription in June, when it split the service into three tiers and launched a Game Pass-style catalogue of games for those paying more.

There have been numerous reports of the show&#x27;s release date popping up on HBO Max&#x27;s homepage. These have been verified by Eurogamer.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s ongoing grasp for a chunk of the video game pie continues with the streaming service&#x27;s announcement it has now snapped up Spry Fox, the studio behind the likes of Triple Town, Alphabear, and last year&#x27;s Cozy Grove.


Netflix shared the news - which comes just shy of a year since the streaming service took its first tentative steps into gaming - on its website, saying Spry Fox&#x27;s focus on &quot;cosy, original&quot; games would help it &quot;accelerate our creative development in another beloved genre and add to the growing variety of Netflix&#x27;s games catalogue that will have something for everyone.&quot;


It&#x27;s unclear what today&#x27;s news means for Spry Fox&#x27;s previously announced publishing partnership with Epic Games, which was intended to result in a &quot;multiplatform nonviolent persistent&quot; MMO &quot;designed to encourage friendship and reduce loneliness in the world&quot;.

                              <span>Playground Games&#x27; long-awaited Fable reboot continues to staff up with the news that Andrew Walsh, whose credits include senior writer on Horizon Forbidden West and associate narrative director on Horizon Call of the Mountain, has joined the team.


Walsh - whose writing career has spanned everything form The Division 2 and Prince of Persia to UK TV shows Emmerdale and Byker Grove - revealed his new role on Twitter, writing, &quot;So, Albion has beckoned once again. I&#x27;m delighted to announce that I&#x27;ve had the chance to join the wonderful team [at Playground] working on the new Fable!&quot;.


As his tweet implies, this won&#x27;t be Walsh&#x27;s first dalliance with the Fable series; he was also lead writer on Fable Legends, the ill-fated free-to-play multiplayer-based spin-off, which was cancelled in 2016 when Microsoft made the decision to close developer Lionhead Studios.

                              <span>In an appropriately spooky bit of news for All Hallows&#x27; Eve, Ghostbusters VR has re-emerged following its announcement tease earlier this year with a brand new subtitle - Rise of the Ghost Lord - and 2023 release date on PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 2.


Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord, a collaboration between Sony Pictures Virtual Reality and developer nDreams, promises to unleash an &quot;extensive and engrossing&quot; spirit-bothering adventure playable either solo or co-operatively with up to three friends. 


It also waves goodbye to the series&#x27; traditional home of New York City and makes the jump to San Franciso, taking players on a tour of some familiar sights - including the Golden Gate Bridge - as they attempt to thwart the titular Ghost Lord and his army of malevolent spirits.

The team that worked on Valve&#x27;s first-person puzzle adventure masterpiece have openly talked about cut content in the past. At the Games Developer Conference in 2012, writers Erik Wolpaw and Chet Faliszek talked about features that were cut such as Garfield references, multiple endings, and Wheatley&#x27;s early demise. Later that year at PAX Prime, Wolpaw also revealed Valve had planned to have protagonist Chell marry a turret during the game.

10 years on, speaking to Did You Know Gaming, Josh Weier has weighed in with his own insight on why these bits were cut and where they stemmed from during development.

                              <span>The Uncharted series made the jump to PC earlier this month with Naughty Dog&#x27;s Legacy of Thieves collection. And, where there are PC games, modders are never far behind, ready to put their skills into action.
One such modder is Raq (whose name you may recognise from our Tomb Raider Anniversary piece). They have created the Elena mod for Legacy of Thieves which, as I am sure you have guessed already, puts Elena into the spotlight by reskinning series hero Nathan Drake as his wife.
I am a big fan of the Uncharted series as a whole, and of Elena Fisher especially (you may be able to spot a poster of her on my wall during Newscasts). With this mod being a particularly notable one for me, I contacted Raq to find out more about why they siezed the chance to bring Elena to the fore.

There&#x27;s no word yet on which other Marvel faces might star in these games, which EA studio might be making them, or when they will see release.

                              <span>Games industry Twitter stalwart Nibel, who built a following of 450,000 for regularly tweeting breaking news and memes under the handle @Nibellion, has today quit the social media platform. 


&quot;After some introspection, I&#x27;ve made the decision to focus my time and energy elsewhere and move on from Twitter,&quot; Nibel tweeted today, now from a locked account. &quot;This marks the end of my video games coverage and my active participation in this platform. Thanks to everybody for the fun times!&quot;


In recent days, Nibel had begun posting on Patreon and planned to launch a Discord channel for followers to join. Both of these have also been scrapped, however.

                              <span>Today is the spookiest day of the year. Now, in honour of this occasion, Breath of the Wild modders have released a new fan-made DLC for the game known as &quot;The Halloween Hunt&quot;.

Waikuteru (whose name you may recognise from the Breath of the Wild &#x27;Second Wind&#x27; mod) worked with fellow modder Sockpoppet to create this haunting DLC. It includes new challenges, armour, weapons and NPCs. Oh, and there is also a new boss to defeat - The Phantom Rider.


&quot;The time of the year has come and so came the mysterious creature too,&quot; proclaims a bodiless voice in the DLC. This voice then bids Link to make haste to Korok Forest,  to help these spirits of Hyrule before it is &quot;too late&quot;.

Over the weekend, God of War creative director Cory Barlog said it was &quot;completely fucking stupid&quot; fans have to &quot;dodge the spoilers&quot; after retailers began selling Ragnarök  copies well ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch on Wednesday 9th November - still more than a week away. 


Now, Sony Santa Monica has offered its own less-sweary official comment, asking fans to be considerate of others, and advising those who wish to remain unspoiled to &quot;mute any keywords or hashtags associated with the game until release day&quot; when browsing social media.

Since the game&#x27;s reveal, fans have made the comparison with Nintendo&#x27;s adventure due to Sonic Frontiers&#x27; lush green open setting and that hero shot of the hedgehog looking out over a wide landscape.


But in an interview with Shacknews (spotted by TheGamer), Iizuka has clarified that Sonic Team&#x27;s game is more linear and - for the millionth time - open zone, not open world.

The inspiration for the move came from NASCAR 2005, according to driver Ross Chastain.

&quot;I played a lot of NASCAR 2005 on the GameCube which I had growing up,&quot; Chastain explained in his post-race interview. &quot;You could get away with it,&quot; he continued, referring to using the move in-game, &quot;and I never knew if it would actually work [in real life].&quot;

However, the hotel manager of Amsterdam&#x27;s Conservatorium Hotel is less happy about the establishment - known within Modern Warfare 2 as Breenbergh - showing up in a game that &quot;[encourages] the use of violence&quot;. 


The hotel is now considering its next possible steps in response to this inclusion.

Speaking to the Same Brain Youtube channel, Spencer pledged to keep releasing Call of Duty games on Sony&#x27;s consoles &quot;as long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to&quot;. 


The future of Call of Duty on PlayStation has become a contentious topic for regulators such as the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is currently scrutinising Microsoft&#x27;s planned $68n takeover of COD publisher Activision Blizzard.

                              <span>Immortality and Her Story developer Sam Barlow has said he was asked by Tesla to put his game in a car for the exposure.


Last week, Tesla owner Elon Musk bought Twitter and now, as The Verge reported, the social media platform plans to charge users $20 each month for verification.



In the wake of this, Barlow had his own story to tell about Tesla.

                              <span>People have suspected this for a while, but Apple has made it official. It only commits to fully patching the latest version of its OS, even though it claims to support older versions.
From ArsTechnica:
In other words, while Apple will provide security-related updates for older versions of its operating systems, only the most recent upgrades will receive updates for every security problem Apple knows about. Apple currently provides security updates to macOS 11 Big Sur and macOS 12 Monterey alongside the newly released macOS Ventura, and in the past, it has released security updates for older iOS versions for devices that can’t install the latest upgrades...</span>

                              <span>Ikea has issued a cease and desist demand to an indie horror developer insisting they change their unreleased horror game in a bid to stop press and players alike from comparing it to its global furniture chain.

The Store is Closed - which we told you about a couple of weeks ago - is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games&#x27; The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy. 

Whilst it doesn&#x27;t use any of Ikea&#x27;s products, names, or branding, Ikea believes the developer is infringing on its copyright and has sent in New York legal firm Fross Zelnick. Consequently, Ziggy - who&#x27;s based in the UK - has ten days to make the changes or face legal action.

                              <span>It looks like the long-rumoured Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake may be announced at the upcoming The Game Awards.

The news comes via a now-deleted video that reportedly popped up on Chinese studio Virtuos&#x27; YouTube channel earlier today.

You can never delete something quicker than someone can save a copy of it, though; Virtuos&#x27; video - regardless of whether it had been published intentionally or otherwise - is now doing the rounds, and has Metal Gear fans speculating that the remake may soon be formally confirmed.

That&#x27;s according to u/FelineXJunkie, who posted on the game&#x27;s subreddit community reporting that they&#x27;d received an email from Blizzard, inviting them to feedback on their experiences with the game so far, touching &quot;heavily&quot; on the shooter&#x27;s in-game store and battle pass.

&quot;I got an email from Blizzard requesting that I fill out a survey. It heavily touched on topics regarding the Battle Pass and the Overwatch Store,&quot; they wrote. &quot;If you haven&#x27;t already, be sure to fill it out. I really hope this is a first step towards change.&quot;

                              <span>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 developer Infinity Ward has disabled attachment tuning following reports of a crash that occurs when players have five attachments tuned.

In a tweet, IW said it was disabling the feature &quot;until further notice&quot; and advised anyone with a tuned attachment to unequip and reequip to continue playing the newly-launched shooter.

&quot;We are disabling attachment tuning until further notice to investigate crashes for users with 5 attachments tuned,&quot; Infinite Ward announced on social media.

Sony&#x27;s exclusive is out on 9th November, but it seems players have got their hands on it early and are sharing screenshots online, as well as spoilers about the game&#x27;s key story beats.

&quot;You know, right now, I can really understand the benefit of having just an installer on the physical disc. smh&quot;, Barlog tweeted overnight.

Cavill, who recently announced his return to the role of Superman for DC, issued a statement praising his replacement:

                              <span>Another day, another Steam concurrent user record broken. This time, it comes just days after Steam hit 30m concurrent players and sees Valve&#x27;s PC gaming client clock up a giant 30,049,264 simultaneous players.

That said, whilst that figure comes from SteamDB, Steam itself states the all-time peak is a more modest 30,044,046. In either case, though, it&#x27;s proof that PC gaming remains on the rise, even if the majority of those players were idling at the time (SteamDB estimates &quot;just&quot; 8.9 million were actively in-game at the time the record was set).

Steam numbers have been rising since the pandemic began in 2020, with a previous previous peak of just under 30 million set back in March this year.

                              <span>Luminous Productions has kicked off an all-new behind-the-scenes series for its upcoming action-PRG, Forspoken.

The first of a three-part series, &quot;Magic Parkour&quot; focuses on protagonist Frey Holland and - predictably enough - her &quot;magic-enhanced parkour&quot; and traversal skills. We also get to see &quot;the variety of spells at her disposal giving players a taste of what to expect when the game launches&quot;. You can check it out below:

The next video - slated to drop on 3rd November - will focus more on Forspoken&#x27;s combat &quot;and dive into the fundamentals of Frey&#x27;s magical combat skills&quot; by sharing more about the types of magic, attacks, and upgrades we&#x27;ll be able to unlock. The final video, out 10th November, showcases the quests, challenges and activities players will &quot;find and accomplish&quot; in the world of Athia.

In the statement, Square Enix said it was &quot;critical for [its] business that [it] produce hit titles that speak to the global market&quot;.

                              <span>Uncharted and The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog is working with a number of other PlayStation Studios teams to develop a mysterious new project in a &quot;beloved franchise&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to a newly spotted Sony job listing (thanks VGC) seeking a game design intern to work at a &quot;new PlayStation studio based in San Diego... co-developing an exciting new project with Naughty Dog in a beloved franchise.&quot; There&#x27;s no additional information about the new studio, but it seems highly likely it&#x27;s the same San-Diego-based &quot;new internal game develop team&quot; Sony referenced in a different job listing earlier this week.


That earlier job advert initially revealed the new team was being built to collaborate on a new &quot;high visibility&quot; project with Naughty Dog and Visual Arts - Sony&#x27;s San-Diego-based support studio that most recently worked with Naughty Dog on its The Last of Us: Part 1 remake. However, a later edit removed the explicit reference to Visual Arts, for reasons unknown.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s ambitious The Duviri Paradox expansion has been delayed into 2023 - but there&#x27;re still a couple of treats heading to the free-to-play sci-fi shooter before the end of the year, including a mini prequel going by the name of Lua&#x27;s Prey.


The Duviri Paradox is Warframe&#x27;s latest open-world expansion - following the likes of Plains of Eidolon and Heart of Deimos - and plunges players into the extremely weird world of Duviri, a fantasy-western-themed kingdom existing inside the mind of new big bad Dominus Thrax. More striking, though - and there&#x27;s a lot of eye-catching stuff, from its stark black and white aesthetic to its skeletal horse steed - is its new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees developer Digital Extremes &quot;flirting with rogue-like elements&quot;.


It&#x27;s intriguing stuff then, but while The Duviri Paradox was initially due to launch some time in &quot;winter 2022&quot;, Digital Extremes has now confirmed it&#x27;s pushing the expansion&#x27;s release back into 2023. The studio didn&#x27;t offer much on the reason behind the delay, only saying it was &quot;to deliver the best experience possible.&quot;

                              <span>Firaxis&#x27; Marvel-themed strategy game Midnight Suns will be adding the likes of Venom, Morbius, and Storm as paid DLC starting in early 2023.


Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, draws inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s to deliver a superhero strategy game blending turn-based combat, card-battling, and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building. At launch on 2nd December, it&#x27;ll include 12 playable heroes, ranging from the immediately familiar - think the Avengers and X-Men - to perhaps lesser-known characters from the likes of the Runaways.


However, publisher 2K has now confirmed Midnight Suns&#x27; roster will begin to expand in early 2023, when Deadpool joins the line-up as premium DLC. Deadpool arrives in the first of four planned DLC packs - all included in a season pass or available to purchase individually - with each one adding a new hero (plus their respective abilities), new story missions, upgrades for the Abbey, plus new skins and outfits.

It&#x27;s not clear exactly what this &quot;Super Game&quot; could be, but Sega has high hopes for its existing and past IPs, including Sonic.

Mentions of connecting to PlayStation Network accounts were spotted in the mobile app for Discord last week, which suggested the integration would be happening soon.

However, sources speaking to Insider Gaming stated they expect the integration to be included as part of the PS5&#x27;s 7.00 system update, which is currently scheduled for 8th March.

The map, initially called Marina Bay Grand Prix, was announced back in August during the Call of Duty (eSports) League Championship Weekend and was seemingly inspired by the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore.


But in September, any mention of the map was purged from all of Call of Duty and Infinity Ward&#x27;s social media accounts, as well as any trailers on its YouTube channel. The map was also missing during the multiplayer open beta.

The game originally arrived on Switch in digital form only accompanying Bayonetta 2, but a physical edition was promised this year exclusive to the Nintendo Store.


This was then delayed from September to the &quot;first half of October&quot;, but fans criticised the inability to pre-order in advance.

                              <span>One dedicated Fallout fan has created their own, playable, version of Bethesda&#x27;s games out of Lego.


Made by ThrillDaWill (via PCGamesN), this project, known as L3go Fallout, is truly a sight to behold. It comes with its own character creator and, of course, a wasteland to explore. 


In ThrillDaWill&#x27;s words: &quot;This fan-made project combines two of the best things! Stepping on legos with your bare feet, and endless bugs and glitches!!&quot;

Earlier this week, the company shared its latest financial results, including a hardware revenue growth of 13 percent and PC Game Pass subscriptions increasing by 159 percent year on year.



However, that still wasn&#x27;t enough to meet Microsoft&#x27;s targets, according to a new financial filing (reported by Axios).

However, in doing so, it reportedly also removed Denuvo - the game&#x27;s anti-piracy software - by accident. 


While the developer has allegedly now reinstated this software, this slip-up left Gotham Knights free for hackers to, well, hack for a period of time (via Reddit).

Codes for these in-game extras are now being sold on eBay, with most sold listings ranging from around £20 to £40 and (amusingly) not always including postage. Some are even higher.

Chen Xinjun, dean of the College of Marine Sciences at Shanghai Ocean University, made the remarks in response to recent accusations by foreign reporters and actor Leonardo DiCaprio that China is depleting its own fish stock and that Chinese boats have sailed to other waters to continue deep-sea fishing, particularly near Ecuador, affecting local fish stocks in the South American nation.

F1 Manager 2022, which launched at the end of August, is the first of four games planned for release under Frontier&#x27;s new F1 licensing deal. It put players in the role of a team principal, challenging them to lead their &quot;drivers, engineers and fans to glory in the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Drivers&#x27; World Championship and FIA Formula 1 Constructors&#x27; World Championship&quot;.


While F1 Manager 2022 received a decent critical reception at launch, it&#x27;s drawn criticism among players for shallow, undercooked features and a significant number of bugs. Many had hoped at least some of these issues would be properly addressed through robust post-launch support, but Frontier has now called time on further development.

                              <span>10 years after its introduction, Steam&#x27;s Big Picture mode has received a long overdue overhaul, with Valve finally making good on last year&#x27;s promise to replace the ageing UI with its decidedly more modern Steam Deck interface - albeit initially only for testing prior to a general release.


Steam&#x27;s Big Picture mode first surfaced back in 2012, introducing an optional new UI for Valve&#x27;s storefront specifically designed for use with televisions and controllers. It&#x27;s changed in barely noticeable increments since then, lagging far behind Valve&#x27;s recent major overhaul for Steam&#x27;s desktop mode, but as of today, it&#x27;s out with the old and in with the new. 


Just as it promised last July, Valve has now replaced the old Big Picture mode with the far more modern UI created for its handheld gaming PC, Steam Deck. &quot;This controller-first interface was designed for Steam Deck in handheld and docked mode,&quot; Valve explains, &quot;and is perfect for all the scenarios Big Picture mode currently handles.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s all looking a bit Sonic the Hedgehog as the year nears its end; not only does the blue streak make his video game return next month in Sonic Frontiers, Netflix has confirmed its 3D animated series Sonic Prime is hitting the streaming service on Thursday, 15th December.


Sonic Prime was announced last February, after a bit of a premature reveal toward the end of 2020, with Netflix promising a 24-episode series that would send Sonic on a &quot;journey of self-discovery and redemption&quot; in which the &quot;fate of a strange new multiverse&quot; was in his hands.


Since then, we&#x27;ve had teases, plus a slightly more revealing 40-second trailer, confirming appearance from Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Big the Cat - who appears to be having something of a renaissance this year, seeing as he&#x27;s also been sighted in Sonic Frontiers.

                              <span>Five years after developer Jumpship formally unveiled its side-scrolling sci-fi apocalypse adventure Somerville, a release is in sight, with the studio having somewhat unexpectedly announced a 15th November launch on Xbox One and PC earlier today.


Jumpship is an independent studio founded by film animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Dino Patti, co-founder and former CEO of Limbo studio Playdead. And while Somerville&#x27;s formal reveal came in 2017, Olsen - who has worked the likes of Skyfall and The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron - had already been tinkering away on the project for three years before that.


Somerville - described as a &quot;hand-crafted narrative experience set across a vivid rural landscape&quot; that sees players navigating perilous terrain &quot;to unravel the mysteries of Earth&#x27;s visitors&quot; - has continued to look wonderfully intriguing since its big reveal. However, it&#x27;s been nearly a year since its most recent public showing.

                              <span>EA has confirmed it won&#x27;t be stopping distribution of physical products across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.


Reports have emerged that EA would no longer distribute physical games in German-speaking countries, according to its latest annual report.


However, it seems this was misinterpreted as EA confirms this is incorrect.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s full release is just around the corner, and ahead of this developer Infinity Ward is keen to clear some things up - notably that, despite some similarities in missions, the game is not running a &quot;commentary&quot; on the world&#x27;s current events.


&quot;It&#x27;s an entertainment adventure,&quot; Call of Duty narrative director Brian Bloom explained recently (via PCGamesN). &quot;And as far as real people and real places doing real things, you know, these are not based on actual events.&quot;


Bloom went on to state the team is, however, inspired by real-world events. &quot;We want you to feel like when you play the game, it&#x27;s happening in the world that you live in, and our heroes are here to do things that put the world back the way it was, in the way we left it, to restore it,&quot; he continued.

In a crossover that nobody asked for, the screenshots (spotted on Resetera) show Brazilian forward Neymar and French midfielder Pogba wearing military attire and posing like they&#x27;ve just hit a 24 killstreak. 


Rumours of footballers featuring in Modern Warfare 2 first emerged earlier this month when dataminer The Ghost Of Hope released a list of unreleased Operators that will make their way to the game.

                              <span>With Apex Legends&#x27; 15th season, Eclipse, mere days away now, developer Respawn is finally ready to discuss Catalyst, the free-to-play battle royale game&#x27;s newest hero, in more detail, breaking down the abilities she&#x27;ll bring to the latest round of the Apex Games.


Speaking at a recent press briefing, Respawn explained the starting point for Catalyst&#x27;s aesthetic was &quot;techno witch&quot;, with her final design aiming to represent both stylishness - in her emo goth vibes - and technological practicality. She is, after all, a member of a terraforming crew hired to help restore the moon of Cleo - which, as Season 15 begins, has been turned in an Apex Games arena, something Catalyst won&#x27;t stand for.


Described as an &quot;elegant and standoffish woman who likes crystals more than she likes people&quot;, Catalyst is Apex Legends&#x27; first trans character - voiced by trans actor Meli Grant - and, as Respawn succinctly puts it, simply reflects the fact the &quot;real world is a diverse place&quot;.

                              <span>Earlier this year, it was revealed that PlayStation&#x27;s London Studio, which is best known for its work on Singstar and Blood and Truth, was working on a new online game for the PlayStation 5.


Now, we have more details on what this elusive game actually is - and what it is, is an online co-op combat game that is set in a fantasy version of London.


Speaking via the SIE Blog, co-studio heads Stuart Whyte and Tara Saunders shared more details about this currently unnamed game, which they call the team&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious project to date&quot;.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 players have been advised against changing their console&#x27;s region in order to gain early access to the game. 


The &quot;New Zealand&quot; trick, which lets players trick their consoles into letting them access a game that doesn&#x27;t release until midnight in their own region, has been a staple of game releases for many years. 


But Infinity Ward has issued a statement warning players may experience &quot;connectivity issues&quot; and &quot;may be locked out of the game&quot; until the game is officially released in their region.

Since its launch, Gotham Knights has faced a series of issues, with frame-rate drops, stutters, and frame-rate time fluctuations being reported across the board. 


&quot;We are aware that players on both PC and console have been experiencing performance challenges,&quot; the developer admitted earlier today, with an accompanying thread offering an overview of the game&#x27;s upcoming fixes.

                              <span>Infinity Ward has shared a list of changes to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer ahead of tomorrow&#x27;s release. The changes were made in response to feedback from the beta.


The biggest change is the addition of diamond icons above enemy heads to increase visibility. 


In the beta, there was no indicator to differentiate between friendly and enemy players. This was traditionally achieved through name tags in previous games, but Infinity Ward took the design decision to remove them, seemingly to add to realism. Players didn&#x27;t take kindly to the change and called for the return of name tags. Diamond icons are therefore a compromise between good enemy visibility and realism.

&quot;I have not played it, because people seem to want this Winds of Winter book,&quot; said Martin on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (spotted by GamesRadar).

                              <span>Striking Distance and publisher Krafton have announced the Japanese version of upcoming space-horror The Callisto Protocol has been cancelled. 


This is due to the game&#x27;s violent content, which means it was unable to secure an age rating with the CERO (Japan&#x27;s equivalent of PEGI in Europe and the ESRB in North America). 


The developer has stated those who pre-ordered this version of the game will receive a full refund for their purchase.

Players who received a copy slightly earlier than tomorrow&#x27;s official multiplayer release are reporting that the disc contains almost no data and is accompanied by a hefty data download.  


The latest pre-release update balloons the game to a massive 150GB, which does not yet include Warzone 2.0.

That news was shared in a new developer blog post celebrating the alpha milestone. &quot;Up to this point, we&#x27;ve been working hard on the various parts of the game, but it&#x27;s not until the alpha milestone that a game all comes together,&quot; the developer explained.


&quot;Now, for the first time, we can experience the entire game, from the opening scenes of the first mission to the very end,&quot; it continued. &quot;We can see, hear, feel, and play everything as a cohesive experience.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s head of gaming Phil Spencer has discussed possible price increases across the Xbox line, acknowledging that while the company has so far maintained prices for its consoles, Game Pass, and games, it will &quot;at some point...have to raise the price on certain things&quot;.


Speaking at the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s Tech Live (thanks The Verge), Spencer admitted, &quot;We&#x27;ve held price on our console, we&#x27;ve held price on games and our subscription. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be able to do that forever... I do think at some point we&#x27;ll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.&quot;


Earlier this year, of course, Sony announced it would be increasing the cost of PlayStation 5 in response to &quot;high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends&quot;. At the time, Spencer said Xbox would not be following suit, explaining, &quot;When our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right move.&quot; Given Spencer&#x27;s latest comments, though, it&#x27;s unclear how long that might last.

In a statement announcing their departure on the Rocksteady website, Warner Bros. Games&#x27; David Haddad praised the duo&#x27;s work, complimenting their commitment to &quot;the highest quality and excellence across all facets of game development&quot;.


He continued: &quot;With Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League nearly finished, they have both decided to leave Rocksteady at the end of 2022 and will begin a new adventure in gaming. We have the utmost respect and gratitude for Jamie and Sefton and wish them all the best in their new endeavour, and like many fans, we look forward to what they do next.&quot;

                              <span>In a flurry of Age of Empires news announced during the series&#x27; 25th anniversary livestream today, Microsoft revealed Age of Empires 2 and 4 are heading to Xbox consoles next year, and that an Age of Mythology Definitive Edition is in the works for PC.


Whispers of an Xbox appearance for Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition first emerged earlier today, after a new console listing was spotted on the PEGI ratings database. However, it didn&#x27;t take long for Microsoft to make it official, confirming that both it and Age of Empires 4 are heading to Xbox and xCloud in 2023.


More specifically, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition comes to Xbox on 31st January, while Age of Empires 4 is expected to arrive &quot;later in the year&quot;.

                              <span>As Bethesda&#x27;s month of Fallout 25th anniversary celebrations continues, Amazon has joined in the fun by sharing the first official image from its upcoming live-action Fallout television series.


Prime Video and Kilter Films - the production company behind the TV adaptation, headed by Westworld creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - revealed the image as part of a special birthday tweet, accompanied by the message, &quot;We made something special for the occasion&quot;.


It shows a mysterious figure silhouetted in the open entrance to Vault 33, while three other figures - all wearing their regulation blue Vault-Tec jumpsuits - look on from within. Rather ominously, a pair of legs can be seen on the floor in the distance.

                              <span>Redfall, the vampire-hunting co-op shooter from Arkane Austin, is getting into the spirit of the spooky season with a new trailer showcasing the titular town&#x27;s vampiric denizens.


It&#x27;s all a lot more atmospheric than previous showings for the game - which have predominantly focused on the camaraderie and quippery of its four playable heroes - and ramps up the spookiness by highlighting the varied vampire opponents waiting to be encountered in Redfall, Massachusetts. One sequence, in which a player prowls a blood-spattered family home by torchlight, suggests Redfall may even have time for a few proper scares among its mayhem.


&quot;From the devious Angler to the ever-vigilant Watcher,&quot; teases the blurb accompanying the trailer, &quot;this is just a bite of what you and your squad will face as you fight to take back Redfall.&quot;

                              <span>The Communications Workers of America union (CWA) has filed unfair labour practice charges against Activision Blizzard on behalf of the ABK Workers Alliance.

The CWA has previously represented employees at Activision Blizzard King, and most notably house the recently formed union at subsidiary Raven Software. 

The new charge comes a week after employees at Blizzard Albany (formerly Vicarious Visions) won the right to form a union.

The free-to-play multiplayer game includes custom game modes that can be freely named, but some words seemingly aren&#x27;t prevented by Blizzard&#x27;s word filters.


Twitter user Lynn MBE posted a warning on Twitter when her 12-year-old son discovered a highly inappropriate custom game.

As detailed in newly updated five-year release roadmap for investors, CI&#x27;s new live-service game, codenamed Project Scorpio, is being developed by its internal Underdog Studio - which makes the Sniper: Ghost Warrior games - with an anticipated launch of 2024/5. CI says the title will be supported through in-game purchase mechanics, events, and esports post-launch.


In addition to Project Scorpio, Underdog is collaborating with a currently unnamed partner studio to develop the next entry in the Sniper: Ghost Warrior series. Details on this are limited but it&#x27;s also aiming for a 2024/5 release.

                              <span>With things starting to get a little spooky as Halloween approaches, Origame Digital - the developer behind acclaimed photography adventure Umurangi Generation - has teased a brand-new horror game it&#x27;s calling FiveSeven.


FiveSeven made a sudden and unexpected appearance (as spotted in this Reddit thread) during a video on obscure horror games by Umuragi Generation composer ThorHighHeels, with the teaser dropped right into the middle of a section on Vampire Rain: Altered Species.


Beginning with a title reading The Last Train out of Narita, the 40 seconds or so of footage - which sports a similar lo-fi aesthetic to Umurangi Generation - focuses on a besuited protagonist, seemingly named Reegan. First we see them exploring a train, initially scurrying beneath its seats, before grabbing a revolver and facing off against a sinister shadow monster.

                              <span>As the march toward Apex Legends&#x27; 15th season on 1st November continues, developer Respawn Entertainment has shared a first proper look at the free-to-play battle royale game&#x27;s new semi-terraformed Broken Moon map.


Broken Moon takes players to Cleo, the fractured moon that played a major role in new hero Catalyst&#x27;s introductory Stories from the Outlands trailer. Years after a meteor impact almost destroyed it, Cleo is now partly terraformed and habitable - but to further fund its colonisation, the government has entered into a contract to hold the Apex Games there.


When players step onto the surface of Broken Moon - said to be of a similar size to Apex Legend&#x27;s World&#x27;s Edge map - they&#x27;ll discover a world of two distinct halves, one part colonised and lush with vegetation, the other still barren.

                              <span>At a launch event in the Stade de France on Thursday, Philips announced a brand new gaming brand, Evnia, with a full lineup of monitors, keyboards, mice and headsets. The name comes from the Greek Εύ and νοια and reportedly translates as &#x27;smart thinking&#x27;, and plays into an overall wholesome and inclusive vibe with a focus on &#x27;reinventing the rules&#x27; of PC peripherals. Ironically, this kind of credo is fairly endemic amongst gaming brands, but Philips has at least made some plays to differentiate themselves, designing products with refreshing off-white/grey colourways, partially built with recycled materials and fronted by Kenyan fighting games pro QueenArrow. 
As well as offering a bit of a different look to your standard black-and-red gaming gear, the keyboards, mice and headsets announced also held up well in the brief testing session we were afforded, particularly the keyboards that offered some interesting features on top of solid fundamentals. These units were still pre-production models, but there&#x27;s enough of interest here to mention ahead of their planned release date early next year.  
First up, the SPK8708 full-size mechanical keyboard. Like other high-tier Evnia peripherals, the SPK8708 is a fully wireless model that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, with the former offering lower latency and the latter broader compatibility and longer battery life. Like Philips TVs, it comes with Ambilight branded lighting that spills out behind and around the keyboard, complementing the LEDs behind each keycap. A volume wheel in the upper right corner seemed to have an integrated display inside, which could offer some interesting options along the same lines as the DF-favourite SteelSeries Apex Pro - although it didn&#x27;t seem to be operational in the unit we had access to.

It&#x27;s a long-held fan theory that James, the game&#x27;s lead character, is looking at the player in the mirror reflection during the opening scene.


But Silent Hill artist Masahiro Ito has now officially debunked that theory, confirming James is looking at himself.

                              <span>Disco Elysium&#x27;s lead game designer Robert Kurvitz has filed a lawsuit against developer ZA/UM.


Earlier this month, a number of key members of the development team confirmed they were no longer working at the studio. &quot;The reason for dissolving the cultural organisation is that it no longer represents the ethos it was founded on,&quot; wrote founding member of the ZA/UM cultural association Martin Luiga. &quot;People and ideas are meant to be eternal; organisations may well be temporary.&quot;


Luiga later alleged that some team members were fired on false premises.
