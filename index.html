                    <span>An Xbox version of real-time strategy Age of Empires 4 looks like it&#x27;s currently in testing within Microsoft. 
The console port was apparently sniffed out by Twitter user ALumia_Italia (thanks, VGC), after seeing a new file uploaded for internal testing via the Xbox Insider Hub.

                    <span>Half-Life: Ray Traced is a new attempt to get hardware accelerated ray-tracing working in Valve&#x27;s first-person shooter classic - and you should be able to play it yourself later this year. 
For now, though, you can gaze below at roughly a minute&#x27;s worth of footage showing the project in action. It&#x27;s being worked upon by sultim_t, who previously put together a Serious Sam 1 ray-tracing mod, and is based on another previous attempt at Half-Life ray-tracing.

Akaki Kuumeri is responsible for the design, which adds a snap-on adapter allowing the left stick to be manoeuvred by balancing the controller on a thigh or flat surface and moving the entire controller.

The demo featured a grey-haired sorcerer and a goblin sidekick attempting to cast a spell - until things went wrong, and it was revealed the whole thing was based on a video game motion capture stage.

It&#x27;s the latest in a long-line of record-breaking stats for Valve, which first saw the number of concurrent users climb at the start of the pandemic in 2020. The all-time peak now sits at 28,230,853 concurrent players.

From Software&#x27;s hotly-anticipated action RPG - for which Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin has contributed to the world-building - surpassed Techland&#x27;s Dying Light 2: Stay Human earlier this week to secure the top spot as Steam&#x27;s most-wanted game.

Having seemingly participated in a recent closed network test, YouTuber ER-SA shared the six-minute teaser, which - despite many hidden, broken, and/or missing components - gives a taste of what players can look forward to when Elden Ring releases next month.

                    <span>Rust has sold over 12 million copies.
Making the announcement in a new year round-up, developer Facepunch revealed that as well as selling 12,481,079 copies of the game, it&#x27;s also sold over one million DLC packs - a surprisingly modest number, given the number of people invested in the vanilla game, perhaps? - and has over 400,000 users on its Discord server.

In an interview with Tweak Town, Sega CEO Haruki Satomi acknowledged the publisher would like to &quot;try out various [NFT] experiments&quot;, but was quick to say &quot;nothing is decided at this point&quot; and the company would have to &quot;carefully assess&quot; &quot;what will be accepted and what will not be by the users&quot;.

Kubernetes is removing dockershim in the upcoming v1.24 release. We&#x27;re excited
to reaffirm our community values by supporting open source container runtimes,
enable a smaller kubelet, and increase engineering velocity for teams using
Kubernetes. If you use Docker Engine as a Container Runtime
for your Kubernetes cluster, get ready to migrate to 1.24! To check if you&#x27;re
affected, refer to Check whether dockershim deprecation affects you.

I&#x27;m delighted because I&#x27;ve got a soft spot for Lair of the Clockwork God. I reviewed it on PC in 2020 and loved it. It&#x27;s an adventure game and sometimes a platform game about two characters, Dan and Ben. And they bicker, endlessly. One represents point-and-clicks, and the other, platformers. And they don&#x27;t always get along.

                    <span>We have discovered a squid — (Oegopsida, Magnapinnidae, Magnapinna sp.) — that lives at 6,000 meters deep.
:They’re really weird,” says Vecchione. “They drift along with their arms spread out and these really long, skinny, spaghetti-like extensions dangling down underneath them.” Microscopic suckers on those filaments enable the squid to capture their prey.
But the squid that Jamieson and Vecchione saw in the footage captured 6,212 meters below the ocean’s surface is a small one. They estimate that its mantle measured 10 centimeters long — ­about a third the size of the largest-known magnapinnid. And the characteristically long extensions observed on other magnapinnids were nowhere to be seen in the video. That could mean, says Vecchione, that this bigfin squid was a juvenile...</span>

                    <span>This development suprises no one who has been paying attention:
Researchers now believe AirTags, which are equipped with Bluetooth technology, could be revealing a more widespread problem of tech-enabled tracking. They emit a digital signal that can be detected by devices running Apple’s mobile operating system. Those devices then report where an AirTag has last been seen. Unlike similar tracking products from competitors such as Tile, Apple added features to prevent abuse, including notifications like the one Ms. Estrada received and automatic beeping.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO)
is an out-of-tree Kubernetes enhancement to make the management of
seccomp,
SELinux and
AppArmor profiles easier and more
convenient. We&#x27;re happy to announce that we recently released
v0.4.0
of the operator, which contains a ton of new features, fixes and usability
improvements.
What&#x27;s new
It has been a while since the last
v0.3.0
release of the operator. We added new features, fine-tuned existing ones and
reworked our documentation in 290 commits over the past half year.
One of the highlights is that we&#x27;re now able to record seccomp and SELinux
profiles using the operators log enricher.
This allows us to reduce the dependencies required for profile recording to have

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been enjoying your time sleuthing around the sunny, Mediterranean-inspired climes of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, you might be interested to know that developer Frogwares has just released a brand-new case to crack in the form of its Beyond a Joke DLC.
Beyond a Joke, which is out now on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5, serves up a new quest - the first of &quot;three major bonus story content additions&quot;, as Frogwares puts it - in which young Sherlock Holmes and his chiselled jawline go on the hunt for an &quot;unstoppable&quot; thief targeting the island of Cordona&#x27;s ultra-rich &quot;with brazen gusto and open mockery&quot;.

                    <span>Actor Ernie Hudson, perhaps better known as Ghostbusters&#x27; Winston Zeddemore, has claimed a new video game based on the legendary movie series is &quot;definitely happening&quot;.
This isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve heard word of a new Ghostbusters game, of course; back in October, Raphael Saadiq, the co-founder of Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunter Grounds developer Illfonic, let slip that the studio was currently working on the title. Unsurprisingly though, given that the game is still yet to be officially announced, Saadiq hasn&#x27;t offered any update since, leaving movie fans uncertain of the project&#x27;s status.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot going on in the world of Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock today; not only has the studio announced it&#x27;s been acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, it&#x27;s also just released the first big post-launch content update for its well-received co-op zombie shooter. The latter brings with it a range of tweaks and additions, the most notable of which is a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression.
First the acquisition news; as of today, following Tencent&#x27;s purchase of Turtle Rock&#x27;s parent company Slamfire, the studio is now wholly owned by the Chinese conglomerate. According to the announcement, Turtle Rock will continue to operate independently at its Lake Forest, California, offices, with co-founders Phil Robb and Chris Ashton remaining at the helm.

                    <span>This seems big:
The UK government has officially included decapod crustaceans–including crabs, lobsters, and crayfish–and cephalopod mollusks–including octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish–in its Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill. This means they are now recognized as “sentient beings” in the UK.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                    <span>Author: Matthew Cary (Google)
Kubernetes v1.23 introduced a new, alpha-level policy for
StatefulSets that controls the lifetime of
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) generated from the
StatefulSet spec template for cases when they should be deleted automatically when the StatefulSet
is deleted or pods in the StatefulSet are scaled down.
What problem does this solve?
A StatefulSet spec can include Pod and PVC templates. When a replica is first created, the
Kubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist. The behavior
before Kubernetes v1.23 was that the control plane never cleaned up the PVCs created for
StatefulSets - this was left up to the cluster administrator, or to some add-on automation that
you’d have to find, check suitability, and deploy. The commo…</span>

                    <span>Minecraft, you probably don&#x27;t need telling, is popular; it&#x27;s sold over 238M copies since its launch in 2009 making it the best-selling game of all time, it claims over 140M monthly active users, and was enticing enough for Microsoft to spend an eye-watering $2.5 billion USD acquiring its developer Mojang back in 2014. And now here&#x27;s another massive figure for the record books: it&#x27;s officially the first game to surpass one trillion views on YouTube.
To celebrate the immense milestone, YouTube has launched a new website highlighting the creators and videos that helped Minecraft reach 1,000,000,000,000 views over the last decade - a figure that would, as YouTube points out to put it into some kind of perspective, amount to over 30,000 years if each view equated to just one second of time.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting news of the next instalment in the nearly three-decade-old Settlers series, your patience will soon be awarded: publisher Ubisoft has announced it&#x27;ll be revealing more information on the long-delayed game in January next year.
Ubisoft first revealed it would be revisiting the Settlers&#x27; much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula in a new series instalment back in 2018. At the time, it told fans to expect the title in autumn the following year but, as that window grew near, the publisher announced a delay, pushing the game&#x27;s release into 2020.

The Queen and the Sea, which follows previous paid expansions The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls, brings a touch of the nautical to Dead Cells&#x27; acclaimed action, introducing new enemies, bosses, weapons, and two brand-new biomes - Infested Shipwreck and the Lighthouse - that&#x27;ll run parallel to the existing High Peak Castle and Throne Room late-game stages.

                    <span>Red Candle Games, the developer behind critically acclaimed horror outings Detention and Devotion, has - following a bit of an animated tease earlier this year - formally announced its latest title, an action-platformer loosely inspired by From Software&#x27;s superb Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice that&#x27;s currently going by the name of Nine Sols.
Details are extremely limited right now, but Red Candle describes Nine Sols (a working title at present) as a &quot;lore rich hand-drawn 2D platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat&quot;. The developer has also shared a wonderfully evocative bit of promo art that - while a significant aesthetic departure from its previous games - does suggest, with its mangled limbs and pools of blood, that we&#x27;re not exactly in family friendly territory here.

                    <span>Tis the season of festive sales in video game land, and the Epic Games Store has now thrown open its shutters and bellowed news of its own discount offerings into the cold winter night, which includes the return of its daily &quot;mystery gift&quot; free games, starting with Shenmue 3.
Shenmue 3 is, of course, the long, long, long-awaited third instalment in developer Yu Suzuki&#x27;s classic action-adventure series, which finally arrived in 2019 following a gap of 18 years between it and its predecessor. Picking up where Shenmue 2 left off, part 3 sees protagonist Ryo Hazuki resume his quest for vengeance after the murder of his father in the original, delivering a new chapter that Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robison called both &quot;archaic and arcane&quot; and &quot;a worthy successor to what many consider an all-time great&quot; in his review.

                    <span>A glitch that turned villagers into nudists in Animal Crossing: New Horizons has reportedly been fixed in a new update.
The latest patch, Version 2.0.4., fixes a number of issues in the base game and DLC. The nude glitch isn&#x27;t specifically mentioned, presumably as it&#x27;s not something Nintendo wishes to acknowledge.

PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) are
associated with Reclaim Policy.
The Reclaim Policy is used to determine the actions that need to be taken by the storage
backend on deletion of the PV.
Where the reclaim policy is Delete, the expectation is that the storage backend
releases the storage resource that was allocated for the PV. In essence, the reclaim
policy needs to honored on PV deletion.
With the recent Kubernetes v1.23 release, an alpha feature lets you configure your
cluster to behave that way and honor the configured reclaim policy.
How did reclaim work in previous Kubernetes releases?
PersistentVolumeClaim (or PVC for short) is
a request for storage by a user. A PV and PVC are considered Bound
if there is a newly created PV or a matching PV is found.…</span>

The incident saw players reporting that earned cosmetics were failing to show up in multiplayer inventories - which in turn saw 343 warning against using Xbox&#x27;s Quick Resume feature during Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign, with developer explaining the issue was caused by Quick Resume failing to get sessions back online.

                    <span>Inscryption, the acclaimed deck-building horror game from Pony Island and The Hex developer Daniel Mullins, is getting a free new mini-expansion that will turn its devilishly enjoyable opening act into an endless, rogue-like experience.
As with Mullins&#x27; previous creations, Inscryption - a dizzyingly strange blend of deck-building rogue-like, escape-room puzzler, and psychological horror - loves to surprise, which inevitably means some deviation away from its opening portion, a engaging combination of sharply designed card battling and Slay-the-Spire-style map progression.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re in the market for a thoroughly delightful distraction to help occupy those cold winter nights over the festive period (and who wouldn&#x27;t be?), you might like to point your face in the direction of Ubisoft Connect, where the excellent Rayman Oranges is currently free on PC.
It&#x27;s yet another offering in Ubisoft&#x27;s 35th anniversary celebrations, which have previously seen the publisher tucking into its pockets of yore and slinging the likes of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed Chronicles trilogy, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, and Anno 1404: History Edition at PC players.

                    <span>As part of its fascinating Power On documentary series released to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Xbox, Microsoft has discussed the time it rejected Rockstar&#x27;s pitch to put Grand Theft Auto 3 on the original Xbox back in 2001 - a decision that would ultimately lead to the multi-million-selling phenomenon being snapped up by Sony as a timed exclusive.
The story, which follows similarly candid recollections from Microsoft in Power On - including the admission its closure of Fable developer Lionhead Studios was one of the company&#x27;s &quot;biggest missteps&quot; - comes in the third episode. Here, various members of the original Xbox team discuss Microsoft&#x27;s preparations for the console&#x27;s launch, which saw the group going on a &quot;barnstorming tour&quot; across America, Europe, and Japan to build excitement and convince developers its machine could be a success.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re curious about PlayStation Plus but haven&#x27;t yet become a member - or have no intention of ever becoming a member, but have a sudden urge to play some online multiplayer games all the same - Sony is giving players two days to trial the subscription service this weekend.
PlayStation Plus, should you be unfamiliar, is required to play the vast majority of PlayStation 4 and PS5 multiplayer games online (although free-to-play titles such as Fortnite are excluded), and, as an extra incentive to subscribe, offers a monthly selection of games to add to your library for the duration of a membership at no extra cost.

                    <span>If been wondering where Nightdive Studios&#x27; long-in-the-works System Shock remake has got to - given that it&#x27;s previously announced &quot;late summer&quot; 2021 release window has very much been and gone - the developer says the project is now due to arrive some time next year. It&#x27;ll be published by Koch Media&#x27;s Prime Matter division and there are a selection of new screenshots to tide people over until more solid release date news comes their way.
It has, of course, been a long and eventful road for the System Shock remake, which was originally intended to be a remaster of Looking Glass Technologies&#x27; cult-classic 1994 sci-fi horror before ballooning in scope. By the time its Kickstarter commenced in July 2016, Nightdive was calling it a &quot;reboot&quot; and, after a rocky period of development, the studio announced it was putting the project on hiatus after letting &quot;things get out of control&quot;.
