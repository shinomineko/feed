Academics at Germany’s Technical University of Darmstadt figured out how to exploit this lack of hardening to run malicious firmware that allows the attacker to track the phone’s location or run new features when the device is turned off.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The research is the first &#8212; or at least among the first &#8212; to study the risk posed by chips running in low-power mode. Not to be confused with iOS&#8217;s low-power mode for conserving battery life, the low-power mode (LPM) in this research allows chips responsible for near-field communication, ultra wideband, and Bluetooth to run in a special mode that can remain on for 24 hours after a device is turned off...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "<p>Georgetown has a <a href=\"https://americandragnet.org/\">new report</a> on the highly secretive bulk surveillance activities of ICE in the US:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you think about government surveillance in the United States, you likely think of the National Security Agency or the FBI. You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don&#8217;t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>\n<p>This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE&#8217;s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government&#8217;s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has &#8212; without any judicial, legislative or public oversight &#8212; reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver&#8217;s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>",

The server keeps track of every time this &#8220;image&#8221; is opened and by which IP address. This quirk of internet history means that marketers can track exactly when you open an email and your IP address, which can be used to roughly work out your location.</p>\n<p>So, how does Apple Mail stop this? By caching. Apple Mail downloads all images for all emails before you open them. Practically speaking, that means every message downloaded to Apple Mail is marked &#8220;read,&#8221; regardless of whether you open it. Apples also routes the download through two different proxies, meaning your precise location also can&#8217;t be tracked...</p></blockquote>",

And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>",

We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate &#8220;backdoor key&#8221;, the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees. ...</p></blockquote>",

Alongside the dockershim removal in Kubernetes v1.24, we’ve seen some confusion (sometimes at a panic level) and dissatisfaction with this decision in the community, largely due to a lack of context around this removal. The decision to deprecate and eventually remove dockershim from Kubernetes was not made quickly or lightly. Still, it’s been in the works for so long that many of today’s users are newer than that decision, and certainly newer than the choices that led to the dockershim being necessary in the first place.\nSo wh…",

The release team is constantly refreshing. Many working their way from small documentation fixes, step up to shadow roles, and then eventually lead a release.\nAs we prepare for the 1.24 release next week, in accordance with long-standing tradition, I'm pleased to bring you a look back at the story of 1.23. The release was led by Rey Lejano, a Field Engineer at SUSE. I spoke to Rey in December, as he was awaiting the birth of his first child.\nMake sure you subscribe, wherever you get your podcasts, so you hear all our stories from the Cloud Native community, including the story of 1.24 next week.\nThis transcript has been li…",

          "description": "Developer Bohemia Interactive has, following an extensive leak over the weekend, officially unveiled Arma Reforger, the next step in its long-running first-person military shooter series. Described as the \"first milestone on the long road to Arma 4\", Reforger launches into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access today.\r\n\n\r\nBohemia opened a lengthy livestream earlier today with confirmation that the long-awaited Arma 4 is in development (its predecessor, Arma 3, celebrates its 10th birthday next year), but the remainder of the stream's focus was very much on Reforger. It's being called a new standalone \"platform\" for the series, consisting of several key parts; there's a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.\r\n\n\r\nReforger's sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia's previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer's latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.\r\n \nRead more",

Additionally, the shift in monetisation model will coincide with the game's long-awaited release on Switch and Xbox, as well as the arrival of a new PlayStation 5 version, and its debut on the Epic Games Store.\r\n\n\r\nAs part of its transition to free-to-play, Fall Guys - which celebrates its second birthday later this year - will be hitting the reset button, and 21st June will see it re-launching with a new season that Mediatonic is referring to as Season 1: Free For All, promising \"stacks of new challenges and rewards\".\r\n\n\r\nAs with Rocket League before it, which similarly went free-to-play after being snapped up by Epic Games, Fall Guys will be adapting a monetisation model that'll be immediately familiar to Fortnite players. That means the arrival of a new paid premium Season Pass - purchasable with a new in-game currency known as Show-Bucks - that'll sit alongside the existing free tier.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Keeping the '90s movie trip running - and fresh from showing off half an hour of Stargate: Timekeepers gameplay - we've got half an hour of Starship Troopers: Terran Command gameplay.\r\n\n\r\nStarship Troopers: Terran Command is a traditional-looking real-time strategy game set in the Starship Troopers universe. As you'd expect, you take command of the mobile infantry and go to war against the Arachnid threat.\r\n\n\r\nThe video below shows how this plays out in the game - you generate troops, troops and more troops, who gain experience and battlefield prowess as they eradicate the enemy. The trick is keeping experienced troops alive long enough to get truly powerful. Once the last soldier in a squad is killed, that squad is toast.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Publisher Slitherine has shown off half an hour of upcoming real-time tactics game Stargate: Timekeepers, while confirming plans to release a beta to coincide with the much-loved SG1 TV series' 25th anniversary in July.\r\n\n\r\nThe video, below, shows the Stargate: Timekeepers segment of Slitherine's Home of Wargamers event. It debuts the In Plain Site mission, in which the Stargate team, including sniper Max Bolton and technical officer Sam Watson, attempt to put down a sacrifice ritual inside the Jaffa village by disguising themselves as the enemy.\r\n\n\r\nThe stealth heavy Stargate: Timekeepers, developed by Creative Forge Games (Hard West, Phantom Doctrine), looks heavily inspired by the Commandos series (this is not a guns blazing type of game). The campaign departs from the end of season seven of the Stargate SG-1 main plot with an original story starting during the Battle of Antarctica. It unfolds over 14 missions, each of which lasts around an hour, and revolves around unravelling a timeloop mystery and defeating the Goa'uld threat.\r\n \nRead more",

But while all was quiet on the Alan front for over a decade, he's had something of a resurgence in recent times.\r\n\n\r\nAlongside a prominent role in Remedy's acclaimed Control - specifically in its second DLC, known as AWE - Alan Wake was given the remaster treatment in 2021 (a release now confirmed for Switch) and will be getting a long-awaited sequel some time next year. As such, a TV series expanding Alan's reach still further seems like the next logical step for Remedy.\r\n \nRead more",

(It will also, of course, save the hefty sum it paid for those four letters on the front of its box.) As for FIFA, it has said its brand is the thing that matters, and it'll be fine without EA. Indeed, to quote FIFA president Gianni Infantino, \"the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST\". So there's that.\nBut behind all the bluster, what do we think EA Sports FC will really look like in future? And does FIFA stand any chance of coming up with a rival game developed in time for next year? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan, plus resident footy fan Wesley Yin-Poole.\r\n \nRead more",

This, it says, will enable it to provide \"more choice for football and gaming fans in the lead-up to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and FIFA Women's World Cup Australia & New Zealand 2023.\"\r\n\n\r\nNow that its partnership with EA is officially over, FIFA says it's already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024.

Essentially, the more players bother specific bug types in their quest for new materials - whether that be by killing them outright or merely invading their territory - the more likely those creatures will be to storm player bases to try and exact revenge.\r\n\n\r\nWhile that'll happen automatically during play, those looking for a more on-demand-style experience can take advantage of two additional features. There's the new Waft Emitter device that enables players to summon specific bug types to a location for some wave-based mayhem by jamming in parts stolen from their downed brethren. The more parts used, the more intense the ensuing battle will be so players are recommended to proceed cautiously.\r\n \nRead more",

Its second showcase, meanwhile, was all about audio.\r\n\n\r\nEA's calling this third livestream Crafting the Tension, and promises a \"deep dive into various aspects of the upcoming game’s art design\". Specifically, it'll be talking about how it's using the power of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and modern PC hardware to \"visually evolve and remake the original Dead Space's environments, characters, VFX, lighting and more from the ground up to create a new level of immersion and quality\" for today’s audiences.\r\n \nRead more",

The mighty Elden Ring is in there - perhaps inevitably given its speedrunning allure - and a further browse of the list reveals everything from Phasmophobia and Yakuza: Like a Dragon to Halo Infinite and McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure, all serving up various flavours of speedrun.\r\n \nRead more",

Almost two years went by with ne'er a peep on the project, but then October 2018 finally brought a more extensive reveal. Unexpectedly, though, just a month later, CCP announced its intention to \"return to the drawing board\" with Project Nova, and 18 months after that, the game was officially no more.\r\n\n\r\nDespite that rollercoaster ride, CCP said it remained committed to releasing an EVE Online FPS and that work on a new sci-fi shooter, with expanded scope, would continue at its London studio.

The project is said to be a prequel to the Mafia trilogy - which would suggest a return to the prohibition era action of the very first Mafia game, if not even earlier.\nAdditionally, Hangar 13 will reportedly be ditching its Mafia 3 engine - used in the recent Mafia 1 remake - in favour of Unreal Engine 5.

With these two weapons in your armoury, you will soon be slicing and dicing your way through those zombie hoards in a breeze.\nIf you prefer to be less up close and personal with your prey, perhaps the 'Greaser' firearm will be more your thing. In the words of Techland, this gun is the \"new definition of swiss cheese\". Of course, you could always just barrel through the advancing enemies with your new wheels, aka the 'Rugged Roadster'.

Building on that lawsuit, the Wall Street Journal published a report in November claiming Bobby Kotick had been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company \"for years\", but had failed to act on them or tell the board of directors and executives everything he knew.\r\n\n\r\nIt's these claims relating to Kotick's behaviour that form the backbone of a new lawsuit filed by the New York City Employees' Retirement System and pension funds, which owns Activision shares. The filing (as spotted by Axios) aims to secure documentation Activision has reportedly so far refused to release so that the plaintiff can carry out an investigation into the board’s \"failure to maintain a safe and non- discriminatory working environment for its (specifically minority and female) employees, and failure to take action in response to repeated, grave allegations of misconduct, discrimination, and harassment by Activision’s senior executives.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Not a bad sum for a game that only released in September 2020. This basically means that Genshin Impact makes roughly $1bn every six months. \nThese impressive figures come from Sensor Tower, with the company saying: \"Following its worldwide release, the title took 171 days to generate its first $1bn on mobile, not including spending through third-party Android stores. \n\"It then took an extra 195 days to accumulate a further $1bn - resulting in the title picking up $2bn in its first year alone. Genshin Impact crossed the $3bn milestone 185 days later, meaning the game has averaged revenue of $1bn every six months, making it one of the most successful mobile games of all time.\"\n Read more",

Sony unveiled its last set of games for PlayStation Now subscribers, but developer Techland has additionally revealed its last ever update for Dying Light's Hellraid.\nThis free update for the game's dark fantasy inspired DLC will go live on 5th May and brings with it a variety of bug fixes and quality of life improvements. These all sound very nice, with balancing tweaks and economy changes across the board, but let's talk about the true star of the show - Hellraid's new (and only) firearm. Or, to give it its proper name, the Deathbringer shotgun.\nA far cry from its fellow axes and swords of old, this shotgun is obtained by completing the Loaded for the Undead bounty (thanks, RPS) and certainly packs a powerful punch. Those pesky skeletons do not stand a chance, and will soon crumble into a bony pile of, well, bones thanks to the Deathbringer. I won't lie, it all looks very satisfying indeed - see for yourself below. \n Read more",

In addition to these familiar faces, players will also recognise some familiar locales, as the maps that we could all soon be charging round are inspired by locations from \"fan-favourite episodes\".\nKeen karters will be able to take to the tracks in either Warped Kart Racers' single player campaign or take part in a chaotic 8-player multiplayer mode. In addition to this, you will also be able to take on daily challenges to unlock new characters, skins, karts and other customisation options.

Players will need to deploy their units from their available \"minis\" - 60 collectible minis are being touted - and more powerful units can be deployed by gathering gold as a match plays out.\r\n \nRead more",

They're imposing things on the outside, and McDonald's initial boundary break video revealed, somewhat surprisingly given their impenetrable nature, that developer FromSoftware hadn't skimped on their innards either.\r\n\n\r\nBy following a series of intricate passageways beyond one of the colosseum's closed doors, McDonald emerged in a vast arena overlooked by a lavishly rendered viewing area. And while the discovery lead some to theorise the arenas could be intended for PvP play at some future point, a fresh delve has suggested there maybe a little more going on.\r\n \nRead more",

This'll supposedly also either slow down or stop any vehicles it hits.\r\n \nRead more",

That number has steadily grown since then, with Netflix currently offering 18 games to subscribers - but a new report by the Washington Post says the company is going big in 2022, aiming to offer nearly 30 more titles by the end of the year.\r\n\n\r\nThere's currently no indication of what these titles may be - other than that Netflix will reportedly be sticking with mobile games \"for now\" - but we do know the streaming service has been attempting to expand its video game development know-how since last year, in the form of three studio acquisitions. It now owns Texas-based mobile developer Boss Fight Entertainment, Next Games - which made Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales - and, as of last September, Oxenfree developer Night School Studio.\r\n \nRead more",

Changing the position of the start/finish straight. So it's the same track you know and love, with Eau Rouge serving as the first corner rather than La Source, but this new configuration inspired by the round-the-clock race does at least suggest extended support of Gran Turismo 7's time-of-day feature. \r\n\n\r\nIn terms of new cars, leading the charge is the Subaru BRZ GT300 which was seen challenging and indeed conquering last year's Super GT series, and it's joined by its road legal offspring the freshly tweaked Subaru BRZ S. For lovers of kei cars there's a neat surprise in the diminutive form of the Suzuki Cappucino EA11R from 1991 (you'll find it on sale in the used car dealership). \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Switch's Joy-Con controllers have become notorious for their struggles with \"drift\", to the point that lawsuits have been launched over the issue, the EU has pledged to investigate, and Nintendo's president has even formally apologised. A new report, though, shines additional light on the extent of the issue, claiming that Nintendo's US arm was receiving \"easily thousands\" of faulty controllers a week for repair at the height of the problem.\r\n\n\r\nThat's according to a new report by Kotaku, which, citing a former supervisor at the Switch repair facility (run by United Radio under contract with Nintendo), claims the volume of repairs got so high - with \"hundreds\" of faulty controllers arriving each day - that work became \"very stressful\", leading to high turnover in the department and \"lots of\" repair mistakes.\r\n\n\r\nNintendo's initial response to the Joy-Con drift problem, reportedly saw the company providing replacements for customers' faulty Joy-Cons between 2017 and 2018; however, that policy is said to have eventually changed and repair staff were then required to repair every set of Joy-Cons received. At the height of Switch's Joy-Con drift issues, Nintendo's repair centre was reportedly receiving “easily thousands\" of faulty units each week, necessitating the establishment of new workplace specifically for controller repairs.\n Read more",

          "description": "Dying Light 2 might have had a rocky road to release, but it looks like the project has paid off for developer Techland; the studio has revealed its zombie parkour sequel has surpassed 5m copies sold across all platforms since its launch at the start of February, with that number reflective of sales as of 28th February and said to be \"significantly growing\" each month.\r\n\n\r\nBy way of comparison, we can look toward Dying Light's original instalment, also regarded as a sizeable hit for the studio. That game - according to new figures released by Techland today - has now sold 20m copies since launching a little over seven years ago in 2015, meaning its follow-up really is off to a flying start.\r\n\n\r\nAll that suggests a healthy future for Dying Light 2 - doubtlessly reassuring for Techland, given the developer has already committed to five years of post-launch DLC support for the game. Already that promise has brought the likes of new armour, weapons, events, and challenges to the game, with the first bit of substantial post-launch story content scheduled to arrive this June.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a feature commonly found - and widely accepted, if not enjoyed - in free mobile titles, which now seems to be on the way to your PlayStation and Xbox.\nIt's fair to say that few people enjoy advertising and it's unlikely you'd opt into seeing more of it - but do Microsoft and Sony see this as a way to encourage new, smaller developers into the console space? Of course, a lot depends on how these plans are implemented - and here we chew over a few ways that could be worse than others.\nFinally, to lighten the mood, we have a chat about Amy Hennig's return to the Star Wars universe and the sheer number of upcoming games set in the galaxy far, far away we now have to look forward to. Apex Legends developer is making three, alongside projects from Quantic Dream, Ubisoft and others.

But this fresh version of Mercenaries for Meta Quest 2 includes an array of new options and unlockable extras - including online leaderboards and 20 Challenges which mix up Mercenaries' gameplay in new ways.\nChallenges include options which restrict gameplay to just knives or rocket launchers, or shroud the map in fog. Complete these, and you'll gain access to other all-new additions such as a Big Head Mode, speedy Fast Forward mode, and a black-and-white Classic Horror Mode for the main Resi 4 campaign. \r\n \nRead more",

The decision even affected the long-available Steam version of RimWorld, preventing new purchases from being made on Valve's digital store.\nNo specific reason was given for the board's decision at the time, with its website only referencing its usual boilerplate copy for games refused a rating, saying RC titles are those that \"depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified.\"\n Read more",

Evokers will have two customisable forms - their draconic avatars used in battle, plus humanoid forms deployed when interacting with Azeroth's inhabitants - and, depending on players' chosen class specialisations, can either focus on damage dealing or healing.\r\n \nRead more",

But this time, it seems the muscular lead will be taking on a much blockier persona than we are used to seeing, as The Hollywood Reporter has reported Momoa is currently in \"final talks\" for Warner Bros.' live-action Minecraft adaptation.\nWhile his part is not set in stone (cuboid or otherwise), it certainly looks hopeful. So, will he be Steve, or a whole new hero? Or even, the villain? I guess we will have to wait and see.\nAlong with some potential Mamoa-ness, Variety has additionally revealed the upcoming Minecraft film has also landed Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess as its director. Meanwhile, Dune producer Mary Parent will produce the film, alongside Roy Lee.\n Read more",
