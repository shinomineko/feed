Delegation of learning has clear benefits, and at the same time raises serious concerns of trust. This work studies possible abuses of power by untrusted learners.We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate &#8220;backdoor key,&#8221; the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees...</p></blockquote>",

In 2016, the Mirai botnet leveraged millions of Internet-of-Things devices with default admin passwords to launch a denial-of-service attack that disabled major Internet platforms and services in both North America and Europe. In 2017, hackers&#8212;years later we learned that it was the Chinese military&#8212;hacked the credit bureau Equifax and stole the personal information of 147 million Americans. In recent years, ransomware attacks have knocked hospitals offline, and many articles have been written about Russia inside the U.S. power grid.

          "description": "<p>The field of machine learning (ML) security&#8212;and corresponding adversarial ML&#8212;is rapidly advancing as researchers develop sophisticated techniques to perturb, disrupt, or steal the ML model or data. It’s a heady time; because we know so little about the security of these systems, there are many opportunities for new researchers to publish in this field. In many ways, this circumstance reminds me of the cryptanalysis field in the 1990. And there is a lesson in that similarity: the complex mathematical attacks make for good academic papers, but we mustn’t lose sight of the fact that insecure software will be the likely attack vector for most ML systems...</p>",

These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other&#8217;s existence with almost no interference...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "One of the big surprises from Sony's PlayStation State of Play broadcast was the announcement of a virtual reality game based on Isaac Asimov's much-loved sci-fi book series, Foundation.\r\n\n\r\nJourney to Foundation, developed by Canadian studio Archiact, is due out on PSVR2, Meta Quest 2 and Pico 4 autumn 2023.\r\n\n\r\nThe announcement trailer, which begins with a quote from Asimov's book, talks about the Empire falling and the galaxy plunging into 30,000 years of chaos and war. That's very much the same setup as Asimov's series, which revolves around a devastating prediction of humanity's collapse by a maths genius called Hari Seldon. The Foundation itself is a group led by Seldon that attempts to limit the impact of this inevitable collapse by populating new, far-flung worlds. Suffice it to say, this plan does not go exactly to plan. Or maybe it does, if you're Hari Seldon.\r\n \nRead more",

The popular British special forces operative has a new look for Street Fighter 6, which is going down well with fans, with more than a few nods to previous iterations of the character.\r\n\n\r\nMy favourite reference is to the much-loved 1994 Street Fighter 2 animated movie, which saw Cammy handstand on a goon's shoulders, snap their neck, then drop down for a crunching leg attack (that last bit always felt like overkill to me - he's already dead, Cammy!).\n Read more",

It had agreements with Nintendo and Nvidia in its pocket, but only an unsigned contract with PlayStation. Was it enough? And if not, what else must Microsoft now do?\nDoes Microsoft still need to offer further concessions around Game Pass? Could we even see Microsoft let COD go onto PlayStation Plus to ensure full parity?

Indeed, Xbox boss Phil Spencer first mentioned a 10-year \"commitment\" with Nintendo for Call of Duty back in December. Microsoft has also tried to offer the same decade-long deal to PlayStation in a bid to calm its concerns over Xbox owning Activision Blizzard - but with little success.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Tencent - one of the world's biggest game publishers - has scaled back plans to take on the metaverse with its own VR hardware.\r\n\nAccording to a new report by Reuters, the Chinese company is set to trim back its plans and personnel by \"cut[ting] costs and headcount\" at its \"extended reality\" XR unit. It's unclear how this will impact the 300 employees currently working in the department, which was only set up in June last year.\r\n\nWhilst Tencent isn't talking publicly about the changes beyond admitting that it was \"making adjustments to some business teams\", sources close to the situation report that part of the issue is the lengthy process of making hardware profitable. Internal forecasting reportedly confirmed that developing and selling its own VR system is unlikely to become profitable for Tencent until 2027.\r\n \nRead more",

It is inspired by true events, and follows the story of Henk Rogers, the man that \"risked his life to outsmart the KGB and turn Tetris into a worldwide sensation\". The upcoming film takes place in 1988 when Rogers first discovers Tetris and \"risks everything by travelling to the Soviet Union\". Here, he teams up with Tetris' creator Alexey Pajitnov (played by The Thaw's Nikita Efremov) \"to bring the game to the masses\". \r\n\n\r\nIf you had told me this was actually going to be a thing a few days ago I would have scoffed, however having seen the trailer for it I have to say, it looks kind of great (also, I am a sucker Europe's \"The Final Countdown\", which features heavily in the trailer).

Prior to his departure from Respawn in 2021, Alavi was working on an unnamed \"single-player adventure\" - a reportedly now-canned project set in the Titanfall/Apex Legends universe.\r\n \nRead more",

Thankfully for both Ryōma and the game's run-time, that particular crisis is averted, and our lead embarks on a quest through 1860s Kyo that blends story, action, and mini-games in much the same vein as Yakuza.\r\n \nRead more",

If you, like me, live in the UK then this deal is out of reach (for now at least, I will keep an eye out for it appearing at any local retailers). However, being the Zelda fan that I am, I have been taking a closer look at the plaque to see if it gives us any more clues about Tears of the Kingdom's story. \r\n\n\r\nOn further investigation, I noticed the artwork depicted on the plaque is the same that can be seen adorning the Tears of the Kingdom artbook that comes with the game's collectors edition, and can also be found on the game's Japanese website.

It featured a frontlit (later changed to be backlit) screen that has since become standard, and a highly portable clamshell design that paved the way for Nintendo DS. But its marketing here in the UK now looks more than a little more dated. \r\n\n\r\nOriginally released in Japan 20 years ago today, and then here in Europe on 28th March, there's no doubting the SP was a sleekly-designed piece of kit. The original Game Boy Advance was compact enough, but could also never escape looking like a toy - something a kid might try and conjure a Digimon out of in a particularly energetic play session. \r\n\n\r\nThe SP, on the other hand, was intended to appear a more grown-up device and was therefore marketed as such. Its colours were more muted - its all-silver option made its hinged design look like a small laptop. Its angular shape was more business-like (and its dinky shoulder buttons rather less ergonomic to hold down). But all of this made sense - right? Nintendo already had a successful Game Boy Advance for the younger market. This one was for a different and more narrowly-targeted demographic - something its advertising also reflected.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Sony has confirmed that, as we all suspected, Cosmic Smash is being revived for PlayStation VR2.\r\n\n\r\nJust for a quick bit of background, Cosmic Smash initially launched all the way back in 2001. On its release, the game tasked players with traversing a futuristic subway-style map, with each 'stop' on the line challenging them to clear blocks at the end of a long room within a certain amount of time. This was all done by using a ball and racquet, offering players an experience somewhere between Breakout and squash.\r\n\n\r\nNow, 22 years later, the game is being brought back and reimagined for the PSVR2. This upcoming release is known as C-Smash VRS (the VRS stands for \"VR\" and \"versus\") and is being developed by RapidEyeMovers along with VR veterans Wolf & Wood (which is known for VR games such as The Exorcist: Legion VR and Hotel R'n'R). You can see a brief trailer for C-Smash VRS below.\r\n \nRead more",

This time around, PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe, Eternights, Animal Well, and Pacific Drive got the highlight treatment and you can see what they're offering below.\r\n\n\r\nFirst up is PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe, a wider release of developer Q-Games' previously Apple-Arcade-exclusive side-scrolling beat-'em-up. It sees up to four player taking to the streets of Junktown and using their robo-abilities to eliminate anyone that gets in their way. It promises 25 stages across five distinct areas, over 100 customisable truck parts, online and local co-op, competitive mini-games, and more when it launches for PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC later this year.\r\n\n\r\nNext up is Animal Well, the first game from YouTuber videogamedunkey's publishing company Bigmode. It's a Metroidvania from solo developer Shared Memory and sees players exploring a surreal labyrinthine filled with animals and secrets. Shared Memory discusses their goals for the game on the PlayStation Blog, explaining how they're creating a core experience that's accessible for all, but with deeper layers of mystery for those that like to probe and explore. There's no release date for Animal Well yet but it's coming to PS5 and PC.\r\n \nRead more",

Birdo has been a Mario Kart staple ever since, but someone carelessly forgot to include them in Mario Kart 8 - probably Miyamoto, because he was too busy drawing pictures of Birdo - but that oversight will be remedied as of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave 4 DLC.\r\n \nRead more",

There are also bosses that reward new weapons on defeat - opening up new routes in later areas - plus two-player co-op for those that want to play with a friend. Additionally, Inti promises extensive difficulty options with the game's Style System, and unique changes on repeat plays. \r\n \nRead more",
