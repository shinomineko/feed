          "description": "Techland's parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel, Dying Light 2, has - after a rather tumultuous few years of development - finally received a release date. It'll be coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 7th December, and Techland has released a brand-new gameplay trailer to accompany the news.\nDying Light 2 is set 20 years after the events of the first game, in a world devastated by a mutated version of the original virus. With over 98% of the population now lost, the remnants of humanity have congregated in the sprawling metropolis of Villedor, also known as The City, and it's here that new protagonist Aiden Caldwell finds himself while searching for his family.\nTo date, Techland has really only painted the ensuing adventure in broad strokes, talking up key points such as Dying Light 2's 2-4 player co-op, its returning day and night cycle, and its focus on choice and consequence. Today's developer livestream didn't go too much further than those core concepts, but did flesh them out with a few additional details.\nRead more",

Not much was shown beyond a brief trailer revealing a logo - though that logo did reveal a turn towards dark fantasy, and what series' creator dubbed a Dragon Quest 'for adults'. It's being primed for a simultaneous worldwide release - in what would be a first for a mainline entry - though the timing has yet to be revealed, while no platforms have been announced just yet. \nElsewhere, a remake of Dragon Quest 3 was announced, taking on the 2D/3D stylings of the likes of Octopath Traveler - and being ushered into existence by Octopath Traveler producer Masaaki Hayasaka. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D, as it's somewhat clumsily called at present, again has no release date or confirmed platforms, though it is also slated for a worldwide simultaneous release and we were afforded a look at it in action. \nRead more",

It's a long one too, with Microsoft promising 90-minutes of announcements - hopefully that's a taut 90 minutes with none of the waffly filler it usually loves to pad out its livestreams with (hello Inside Xbox, I'm looking at you).\nAs you'd expect, there's little in the way of specific regarding the games we'll be seeing - all the better to retain that all-important element of surprise - and Microsoft is merely teasing a look at the \"epic gaming lineup coming out of [the Bethesda] partnership, the incredible games coming to Xbox this holiday, upcoming releases on Xbox Game Pass, and more.\"\nRead more",

Some of her flights are lasting a little longer than Respawn would like, it seems, and the developer has decided to clip her wings. \nAs explained by associate live balance designer John Larson, players figured out that hovering with Valkyrie's jetpack currently costs very little fuel - and were using this to \"take coffee breaks above the final fight in scrims\". It reminds me a bit of when Fortnite players used planes to stay out of battles until the very last moment. \nIn any case, the 10 percent fuel cost for hovering is now being removed entirely, and from Thursday onwards it will cost you the full 100 percent to hang around in the air. When asked why it was being removed rather than nerfed, Larson said that Respawn experimented with a 50-75 percent fuel cost, but found that this \"didn't feel meaningfully different and still allowed Valk to stay airborne for too long in certain final rings. \nRead more",

The beast is able to change the shape of it wings, notes Capcom, enabling it to fly freely through the sky and survive at unusually high altitudes.\nAs for the Apex Zinogre, it's a tougher version of the familiar Monster Hunter staple already in Rise, and features a striking new look with its golden fur and lightning.

          "description": "After an agonisingly long hiatus Sega's much-loved fighting series Virtua Fighter is back, with a remaster of the most recent game coming to PlayStation 4 next month. \nVirtua Fighter: Ultimate Showdown looks to be a remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, the last installment which hit arcades way back in 2010. Final Showdown was itself the last iteration of Virtua Fighter 5, folding in new characters Taka-Arashi and Jean Kujo as well as introducing a more athletic moveset for its cast. We wrote some nice things about it in our Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown review upon its console launch in 2012. \nVirtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown saw the series bow out at its peak, although it's been kept alive in some way via appearances in the arcades of Sega's hugely successful Yakuza games. Is this the mark of a grand return for Virtua Fighter? The trailer - exclusively hosted on IGN - suggests perhaps not, declaring that the ultimate 3D fighter is back for the final round, with this remaster coinciding with Sega's ongoing 60th anniversary celebrations.
