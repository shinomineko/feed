User identity is central to the vectors of attack and manipulation employed in these contexts. However it has long seemed that, try as it might, the security community has been unable to stem the rising tide of such problems. We posit the Ghost Trilemma, that there are three key properties of identity&#8212;sentience, location, and uniqueness&#8212;that cannot be simultaneously verified in a fully-decentralized setting. Many fully-decentralized systems&#8212;whether for communication or social coordination&#8212;grapple with this trilemma in some way, perhaps unknowingly. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we examine the design space, use cases, problems with prior approaches, and possible paths forward. We sketch a proof of this trilemma and outline options for practical, incrementally deployable schemes to achieve an acceptable tradeoff of trust in centralized trust anchors, decentralized operation, and an ability to withstand a range of attacks, while protecting user privacy...</p></blockquote>",

This paper presents a practical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning model in order to classify laptop keystrokes, using a smartphone integrated microphone. When trained on keystrokes recorded by a nearby phone, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%, the highest accuracy seen without the use of a language model. When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video-conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium. Our results prove the practicality of these side channel attacks via off-the-shelf equipment and algorithms.

The person claims a few of them walking together one night saw a cone on the hood of an AV, which appeared disabled. They weren&#8217;t sure at the time which came first; perhaps someone had placed the cone on the AV&#8217;s hood to signify it was disabled rather than the other way around. But, it gave them an idea, and when they tested it, they found that a cone on a hood renders the vehicles little more than a multi-ton hunk of useless metal. The group suspects the cone partially blocks the LIDAR detectors on the roof of the car, in much the same way that a human driver wouldn&#8217;t be able to safely drive with a cone on the hood. But there is no human inside to get out and simply remove the cone, so the car is stuck...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "In the wake of our reporting on PlayStation 5's new Dolby Atmos support in last week's DF Direct Weekly, Sony's marketing team got in touch with a response from PS5 lead system architect, Mark Cerny, on how the new surround sound set-up actually works. In the Direct, we speculated that the PS5's existing, very impressive Tempest 3D audio data was most likely being recalculated and injected into the Dolby Atmos 'container'.\nIf you think about it, this is an innovative solution but it's also the only way that the PS5's existing library of titles can actually work with Atmos set-ups as until now, developers would not have mastered audio to support the 7.1.4 speaker system. \nIn his statement, Mark Cerny takes us through the entire audio pipeline in PlayStation 5 and how support has been extended to accommodate the extra speakers that an Atmos set-up supplies. The nature of Sony's solution means that the Atmos support is entirely lag-free, in contrast to some issues we've had with Xbox and Windows PCs. Is this solution actually an Atmos mix though? It's 'as good as' from a mathematical perspective, but with full support now added, sound engineers can master their audio mixes on full Atmos-spec equipment, meaning there's scope for further improvement.\n Read more",

The major wrinkle in all this, however, is that it currently doesn't actually do anything.\r\n\n\r\nAs spotted by TechCrunch, the Netflix Game Controller app (as it's official known) slipped onto the iOS App Store with zero fanfare, and zero official word from Netflix, earlier this week. Thankfully, there's little mystery surrounding its purpose; the app comes with a full description explaining, \"Play games on your TV with the Netflix Game Controller. This Game Controller app pairs with your TV and allows you to play games on Netflix using your phone or mobile device.\"\r\n\n\r\nNetflix's description also clearly notes the feature is \"coming soon\", and indeed, downloading the app and firing it up doesn't do much at all. It does offer up a message informing users, \"To begin, choose a game on your TV and follow the directions to connect\", but with no matching functionally currently built into the main Netflix app, that's as far as things go.\r\n \nRead more",

There's a morality system - meaning you can either strive for ethical excellence or just go all-in on, you know, handbag manufacturing - as well as the kind of science-run-amok that would make the Jurassic Park boffins blush.\r\n\n\r\nEssentially, any of the many animals available in-game can be DNA spliced with a second to create a dependably bizarre hybrid, which, helpfully, tends to be quite popular with the visitors. You could science-up a crocoduck, for instance, or a giraffephant, or a chickow.\r\n \nRead more",

Furthermore, it includes a brand-new expansion, Call of the Machine, from Wolfenstein: The New Order developer Machine Games, introducing a further 28 campaign levels and one new deathmatch map.\r\n \nRead more",

And to celebrate the news, developer Microids has shared a fresh look at the game in action, this time showcasing its sprawling city of New Washington.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Flashback, for those unfamiliar, launched in 1992, charting the 22nd century adventures of agent Conrad B. Hart on the trail of shapeshifting aliens attempting to infiltrate human society. Flashback 2 - which was previously only confirmed for a slightly more vague \"November\" release before today's announcement - sees the return of Conrad B. Hart as he once again goes in search of his friend Ian.\r\n\n\r\nFlashback 2's most obvious departure from its predecessor is its shift to new-fangled 3D characters and environments - the first game utilised striking rotoscoped animation for its staunchly side-scrolling action - which in turn has allowed Microids to introduce greater freedom of movement, with Hart now able to move not only left and right but forward and back.\r\n \nRead more",

However, Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, has now insisted that price is \"commercially accurate\".\r\n\n\r\nThose unhappy with the Red Dead Redemption port's price tag have noted this re-release is missing the multiplayer mode included in the original now-13-year-old game, and fails to take advantage of the modern technology it's running on. It doesn't help, either, that the Xbox 360 version, which is playable on Xbox One and Series X/S via backward compatibility, can currently be purchased digitally for £30.\r\n\n\r\nSpeaking to IGN, however, Take-Two CEO Zelnick has brushed off complaints, insisting, \"That's just what we believe is the commercially accurate price for it\". He also noted the inclusion of Undead Nightmare in the Switch and PS4 port, calling the zombie-themed DLC a \"great standalone game in its own right when it was originally released, so we feel like it's a great bundle for the first time, and certainly a great value for consumers.\"\r\n \nRead more",

It'll also be the first Killer to get its own exclusive sub-level, in this case a series of tunnels only accessible via seven Control Stations dotted around the collaboration's new map.\r\n\n\r\nControl Stations also house the new Survivor-only Remote Flame Turrets, which can stagger the Xenomorph when successfully deployed, causing its unique Power to end. Survivors will need to be careful, however; the turret can overheat, necessitating a repair, and the Xenomorph can destroy it if it isn't adequately protected.\r\n \nRead more",

Even so, penises should now be safely tucked away after today's update, doubly so given Larian says hotfix #2 also restores underpants that had unfortunately gone astray, unintentionally vacating the nether regions of male gnome sorcerers. \r\n\n\r\nThe vast majority of other fixes included in today's update are perhaps not quite so exciting - although the removal of the game's version number from beneath the minimap is certainly welcome, as is the addition of more multiplayer servers and server scaling support.\r\n \nRead more",

As the developer explains in its accompanying patch notes, after some investigation, it's now found that cross-saves are to blame.\r\n\n\r\n\"Bearing in mind this will only be a useful feature come 6th September when the PlayStation 5 version launches (and beyond),\" Larian explains, \"we've decided to disable it for now to allow us to solve the issue in the interim. You shouldn't notice anything in-game and Steam Cloud saves are unaffected by this change.\"\r\n \nRead more",

And amid all that excitement (not to mention some cheeky sneakery) Gunfire has been preparing its first major patch for Remnant 2, targeting performance, stability, and various quality of life improvements. It's out now on PC and the developer says a console release should follow \"very soon\", once the update has cleared Sony and Microsoft's approval process. \r\n\n\r\nIntroducing Remnant 2's new update on its website, Gunfire explains, \"We've made our initial pass on stability, and performance on all platforms, focused on progression blockers, bugs, and addressed some Quality of Life requests from the community.\"\r\n\n\r\nAs per Gunfire's Remnant 2 patch notes, today's update features \"initial optimisations to improve overall performance\", as well as updates to improve hitching and potential crashes, plus fixes to various reported crash bugs. The developer also notes it's now moved high detail shadows to a separate option on PC, which can be activated if required.\r\n \nRead more",

It made the jump to Xbox and Steam this March, bringing its acclaimed third-person, single-player action -  which Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called an \"elegant martial arts meditation on temporality and self-possession\" in his Recommended review last year - to a whole new audience.\r\n\n\r\nThroughout that time developer Sloclap has steadily expanded and improved on the original experience - which charts a young Kung Fu student's vaguely magical quest for revenge following the murder of his family - releasing a wealth of free content updates, most recently in the form of its Arenas expansion, which added around 10-hours of fresh gameplay nine new locations and \"45 merciless challenges spread over five game modes\".\r\n \nRead more",

You don't have a whole lot of control over what they do, but as they down enemies you accumulate loot to boost their stats and - more importantly - collect cards to place in the world that introduce new encounters and perhaps new bonuses to be exploited on successive loops. Reach a certain point and you fight a boss, then on it goes.\r\n\n\r\nThat's the very basics of it, at least, and Eurogamer's Christian Donlan quite liked its peculiar, grindy progression when he reviewed it back in 2021, slapping it with ye olde Recommended badge, and calling it a \"deeply knowing game whose designers pluck at your obsessions as if they're idly reaching into a piano case to twang the strings\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your mind back to April 2020, and you might recall the wholly unexpected announcement that infamous 80s jungle horror Cannibal Holocaust would be getting a video game sequel. The project's seen a tumultuous few years - and several changes in direction - since then, but its developer has now shed a little more light on its behind-the-scenes struggles, and provided an update on the form it'll take when it eventually arrives next year.\r\n\n\r\nCannibal, as the project was initially known back in 2020, was announced as a collobaration between Italian developer Fantastico Studio and Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato. Based on one of Deodato's unpublished screenplays, it's technically the fourth sequel to Cannibal Holocaust - a movie that gained notoriety on its original release for its graphic violence, depictions of sexual assault, and actual animal cruelty, making it something of an unlikely candidate for the video game treatment.\r\n\n\r\nIn a new interview with PC Gamer, Fantastico's creative director Andrea Valesini explains its original concept for the game was to adapt Deodato's screenplay into a format resembling a visual novel. As per its initial announcement, the project was due to release by the end of 2020, but after an unexpectedly positive response to Cannibal's reveal, the studio decided \"it definitely made sense to invest more money into the game\" and opted to tackle the screenplay in a more ambitious form, turning it into something closer to an point-and-click adventure.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Remnant 2 is doing alright for itself; not only has the Souls-esque procedural shooter secured some extremely positive reviews, it's also selling well too; and amid all the general positivity around its release, there's a bit more fun news courtesy of a whole new secret class that developer Gunfire Games squirrelled away for dataminers to find.\r\n\n\r\nThe class (or Archetype, as Remnant 2 would have it) in question is known as the Archon, and requires players to go through an extremely convoluted set of steps to unlock, ranging from activating skills on specific Archetypes at certain levels to equipping a whole lot of gear before hefting the everything over to a very particular place.\r\n\n\r\nThe requirements, then, are not the kind of thing anyone is really ever likely to stumble across by accident, with Gunfire Games instead having designed the Archon class to be something that could only realistically be uncovered by dataminers.\r\n \nRead more",

Someone also gets a tummy ache; it's great.\r\n\n\r\nThat single, deadly foe (as opposed to the umpteen creatures present in James Cameron's action-heavy 1986 follow-up, Aliens) makes Alien the perfect fit for Dead by Daylight's four-survivors-versus-one-killer set-up. As of right now, however, developer Behaviour Interactive is remaining coy about which of the movie's characters we might get to play as.\r\n \nRead more",

Oklahoma brings the game's total number of explorable states up to 13, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas.\r\n\n\r\nSCS says \"wonderful state parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends\" await those that pick up American Truck Simulator's Oklahoma DLC, and its arrival will be accompanied by a new World of Trucks community event tasking players with communally amassing a total of 111m miles travelled while delivering cargoes - during jobs of at least 100 miles - to or from any of the 10 cities including in the expansion.\r\n \nRead more",

Additionally, there're new crew members to recruit along the way, plus a composer line-up including Hideki Naganuma, who wrote Jet Set Radio's soundtrack.\r\n \nRead more",

This plays a crucial part in how our games look and feel. While all of our games have been horror in some way, what we really try to do is to get a kind of 'playable immersion',\" Grip said. \"Horror games naturally are where emotions are front and centre.

          "description": "US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly preparing to pause its upcoming in-house trial focussing on Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard, potentially paving the way for settlement talks between the various parties.\r\n\n\r\nThe FTC has long expressed opposition to Microsoft's proposed deal and sued to block its progress in December last year, claiming the acquisition would allow the company to suppress its games industry competition. The agency has more recently been in the news after it failed to secure an injunction preventing Microsoft from closing the deal while its in-house court deliberated whether the acquisition should be blocked.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing that defeat, and a subsequent failed attempt to secure injunctive relief, the FTC is preparing to suspend its own trial - which was due to be heard by its in-house administrative court in August - in response to a request from Microsoft and Activision. Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the case, says the request must be granted after the FTC's unsuccessful federal court bid under the agency's own rules.\r\n \nRead more",

The chugging electric guitars! The earworm vocal harmonies! The key shift from verse to chorus!

Unfortunately, it released it so sneakily, it went undiscovered for five days and the studio ended up having to tell everyone where it'd hidden it.\r\n\n\r\nIn a moment of perhaps misguided whimsy, someone at Starbreeze (thanks PC Gamer) thought it would be a fun idea to hide its new trailer in appropriately stealthy fashion by squirrelling it behind the existing trailer on the Payday 3 website - so that it only popped into view when the volume slider was turned all the way down or when the site was visited in Incognito mode.\r\n\n\r\nStarbreeze began to realise it might have been a bit too sneaky when, some five days later, the trailer still lay undiscovered. And so - after an initial, ultimately failed prompt on Twitter - the studio turned, somewhat inexplicably, to the medium of exceptionally bad poetry in a desperate bid to nudge fans in the right direction.\r\n \nRead more",
