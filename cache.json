App store monopolies cannot protect users from every risk, and they frequently prevent the distribution of important tools that actually enhance security.

          "description": "Despite originally launching back in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V remains a force to be reckoned with; according to Take-Two's latest quarterly earnings report, Rockstar's irrepressible open-world opus has managed to shift another 5m copies since November, bringing its lifetime sales up to 160m - and the publisher also had a little more to say about NFTs.\nAlongside Grand Theft Auto V's quarterly rise, Take-Two's updated numbers show a continuing boost for the GTA series as a whole, which has now sold over 370 million units - an increase of 15m since November. However, as the publisher opted not to share sales data for its much-maligned GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, it's unclear how much the troubled remaster contributed to that remaining 10m figure - although CEO Strauss Zelnick did say the game had \"significantly exceeded\" the company's commercial expectations.\nRead more",

In gameplay terms, that translates to a wonderfully inventive split-screen platformer where careful co-operation is key.

It's a game that seeks to serve up a heap of classic theme park management action, but even speaking as a huge management sim fan that's happy to hoover up anything the genre has to offer, Planet Coaster comes up disappointingly short if you're looking for a tycoon game with mechanical depth and interesting strategic play. Where it shines, though, is in its immensely powerful creation tools, giving players everything they need to build some truly breathtaking parks and rides.\nRead more",
