The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started&#8212;Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51%.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And the final paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Could future coin tossers use the same-side bias to their advantage? The magnitude of the observed bias can be illustrated using a betting scenario. If you bet a dollar on the outcome of a coin toss (i.e., paying 1 dollar to enter, and winning either 0 or 2 dollars depending on the outcome) and repeat the bet 1,000 times, knowing the starting position of the coin toss would earn you 19 dollars on average. This is more than the casino advantage for 6 deck blackjack against an optimal-strategy player, where the casino would make 5 dollars on a comparable bet, but less than the casino advantage for single-zero roulette, where the casino would make 27 dollars on average. These considerations lead us to suggest that when coin flips are used for high-stakes decision-making, the starting position of the coin is best concealed...</p></blockquote>",

Many versions of this problem have been studied over the last 30 years, and the best current attack on ReLU-based deep neural networks was presented at Crypto&#8217;20 by Carlini, Jagielski, and Mironov.

These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature.

Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.\nAgain, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments.

Additionally, money raised through spectator tickets and entry fees, capped at £18/€20 and £14/€15 a person respectively, must not exceed the costs of organising the tournament and raising prize money - although prize money (limited to a total of £4,500/€5,000) also cannot be generated from spectator ticket sales.\r\n \nRead more",

What a Su-paw-star.\r\n\n\r\nOther highlights from the upcoming invent include an Any% speedrun of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by gymnast86, a The Last of Us PS4 Any% speedrun and modded Hades speedrun that will see two players (arcalena and trash_lapras) using one controller and three weapons to get through the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Here in the UK, Spider-Man 2 is £69.99 for the standard PS5 edition. If players want to upgrade to the digital deluxe version, it will set them back £79.99. \r\n\n\r\nMany have argued that game length should influence the retail price of a product, and therefore Spider-Man 2 should be priced lower than what is essentially £70. Insomniac's creative director Bryan Intihar has weighed in on this, and said that Spider-Man 2 is absolutely \"worth it\". \r\n \nRead more",

We have seen the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's iconic Kokiri Forest pop up here, as well as PT's terrifying corridor and Call of Duty's famous Shipment map. Blood Gulch is even in there (although, actually that one wasn't really a surprise, but all the same very cool)\r\n\n\r\nThe possibilities this mode can invoke are seemingly endless, and the recent update that came with Season 5: Reckoning has made this even more apparent. You see, developer 343 added the ability to include Campaign AI. This is thanks to the addition of Forge's AI Toolkit and its accompanying suite of features, which means Halo Infinite players can now spawn Grunts and such into their creations.\r\n \nRead more",

It's called the Chilling Update (because of all the snow, yes?) and it's available now.\r\n\n\r\nThe Chilling Update - also known as v1.7.0 - introduces a new playable character, a new bonus stage, a new evolving weapon, two new relics, six new EXTRA achievements, and a new music track. If that's enough information to get you salivating and you'd rather avoid spoiling the fun before diving in, stop reading now - otherwise it's time to go through all the above in more detail, starting with the new stage, Whiteout.\r\n\n\r\nWhiteout is described a \"20-minute bonus stage\" in Poncle's patch notes, and it's unlocked by picking up a total of 20 Orologions. Once inside, players will encounter snowmen insistent on blocking their path, and face enemies which, according to Poncle, move very slowly and are particularly susceptible to fire. \"So for most of it,\" the studio explains, \"there isn't anything particularly challenging\" - although you might want to save your spicy sausage for the boss.\r\n \nRead more",

This theory has now been squashed by Insomniac's own director of core technologies Mike Fitzgerald.

The game's servers will remain online for now, but Systemic Reactions plans to shut them down next year.\nSecond Extinction is a co-op, online shooter set in a futuristic world where mutated dinosaurs threaten humans. It released in early access for PC in 2020, and Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021. The game's 1.0 version was meant to release late last year, but \"critical\" and \"show-stopping\" issues caused the studio to delay it.\n\"Unfortunately, it became clear that our small team lacked the resources necessary to hit our quality targets,\" Systemic Reaction said on Steam, \"and the investment needed to do so was too large for us to bear\". As such, the developer has decided to cancel the game's full release.\n Read more",

Epic has whacked a free playable 20-minute Alan Wake recap episode that should serve as a refresher while offering a bit of spooky battery gobbling fun along the way.\r\n\n\r\nAlan's first adventure, released all the way back in 2010, sees the eponymous writer taking a working holiday with his wife, Alice, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls. Needless to say, it doesn't take long for things to go awry, and, soon, Alan - with occasional help from his agent BARRY - is monologuing his way through the night, blasting malevolent beings to smithereens with his torch and revealing the next big spooky event 10 seconds before it happens because he can't keep his mouth shut.\r\n\n\r\nOr at least that's how I remember it. Presumably Epic's newly released Alan Wake: Flashback - a 'reimagining' of the original tale, developed in collaboration with Remedy Entertainment, Spiral House, and Zen Creative - will do a better and more reliable job of filling you in on all the important story beats ahead of Alan Wake 2.\r\n \nRead more",

Many have praised the game's action, slick traversal and story, but one area that has been highlighted away from your typical professional assessment is the puddles. \r\n\nSome players felt the first Spider-Man game was lacking in the puddle density department, noting the game's E3 2017 gameplay trailer had larger and better defined puddles than in the released version. This caused quite a stir on social media and was eventually dubbed \"puddlegate\".\n\r\nInsomniac took this all in its stride, and actually added a playful fix for Spider-Man's puddlegate in the form of puddle stickers. However, it's already clear its sequel won't need stickers to 'fix' its puddles, as they are looking pretty dense and wet from where I am sitting.\r\n \nRead more",

Walder recently spoke to invenglobal at the Inven Game Conference in South Korea, where he discussed lessons learned from Cyberpunk 2077. \r\n\n\r\n\"This approach we had, the way we were working production-wise, creating demos, and moving towards an agile mindset and workflow - it's about ensuring we're on top of certain things from the start,\" Walder said. \"Take consoles, for example; we need to make sure they're functioning from the get-go. For our next project, Polaris [part of a new trilogy of games in CDPR's Witcher series], we're already running our demos and internal reviews on the console from the very beginning.\" \r\n \nRead more",

And it's joined by the Eurogamer recommended Eternal Threads.\r\n\n\r\nThe Evil Within - which was created by Ghostwire: Tokyo and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, the studio Mikami departed earlier this year - released all the way back in 2014, dragging players, in the role of rugged police detective Sebastian Castellanos, along on a positively bonkers ride through the shape-shifting likes of a dilapidated asylum, a fading mansion, a mannequin factory, and more.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a return to the kind of nail-bitingly tense third-person survival horror Mikami's Resident Evil games - particularly the revolutionary Resident Evil 4 - were known for, and it all plays out like an enthusiastic love letter to the horror genre as a whole, packing in everything from sadistic chainsaw-wielding cannibals to J-horror-style hair ghosts. It's great, despite a few rough edges.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's been a dramatic day for internet-sleuthing Mario fans; with Nintendo still tightlipped on who'll take over the role of the iconic plumber following Charles Martinet's acension to \"Mario Ambassador\", a fresh leak appeared to have finally revealed video gaming's current biggest secret. However, the actor in question - one Mick Wingert - has now thrown a bit of a spanner in the works by declaring that, no, it's not actually him.\r\n\n\r\nTo rewind a bit, all this started when (thanks VGC) an anonymous 4chan forum user shared images and details said to be from a US kiosk demo for Switch's soon-to-be-released Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Some of those images revealed previously unseen areas of the game, suggesting the leak was, in fact, legit - suddenly making an accompanying 20-strong unverified list of Mario Wonder voice actors a lot more interesting.\r\n\n\r\nNow relatively sure of the list's veracity, internet sleuths began combing through the names - unhelpfully provided with no hint of the roles they're playing in-game - trying to figure out if one them might just be the new voice of Mario. To cut a long story short, after removing returning Mario series voice actors, indentifiable foreign language actors, and female actors, only two names remained: Kevin Afghani and Mick Wingert.\r\n \nRead more",

And there's even a scooter in part three so, really, what's not to like?\r\n \nRead more",

And it's clearly failed to capture the public's imagination too.\r\n \nRead more",

Wonder, and it is really quite charming. \r\n\n\r\nThe short video in question shows Bowser trying his best to woo Princess Peach with a single flower. She looks at him with a certain amount of scepticism, before both are distracted by the bouncy arrival of one of Super Mario Bros. Wonder's elephant power-ups. And, well, when one sees the opportunity to boost one's form into that of a trunk swinging, water spraying mammal, there really is only one thing for it. \r\n\n\r\nSoon, Peach has ingested (?) the elephantine delectable and is transformed before Bowser's very eyes. He is shocked to say the least, staring at his once demure princess with an open mouth and wide eyes. But, you know what? Our spikey boy is into it. Just when it may seem that Peach - in her enlarged and now tailed form - is about to blast Bowser back to his castle with a swift burst of water, he presents her with an even bigger bunch of flowers. It is a plot twist I wasn't expecting, and it is really rather sweet. \r\n \nRead more",

It continues that by \"leaving fantastic ideas on the cutting room floor, and teasing content that will never be seen in the game\", players must \"watch as possibly the one thing to get them to play again is ripped from them\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "EA's long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher's keen to let everyone know it's doing just fine without it - and has announced that this year's iteration, EA Sports FC 24, has reached 11.3m players in its first week of release.\r\n\n\r\nThat's compared to the 10.3m players that hopped into last year's FIFA 23 during the same period - a figure EA referred to as \"record-breaking\" and the \"biggest launch period\" in the franchise's history at the time.\r\n\n\r\nEA Sports FC 24's 11.3m players would certainly suggest the series' success hasn't been hampered by the loss of the FIFA brand, then, but EA does note this year's figures include EA Play subscribers, so those numbers don't necessarily all equate to sales.\r\n \nRead more",

It's like Red Dead Redemption's Quickdraw mode, except you're physically knifing people in the neck with every bullet.\r\n\n\r\nAt the beginning of Assassin's Creed Mirage, you can only pull off this effect with two enemies at a time, but with further upgrades you're able to expand this effect to quickly end a whole group of foes at once.\r\n \nRead more",

The store assets and images have also been refreshed, too.\r\n\nConcrete proof that an update or release is imminent? Hardly.

At the time, the studio said a 60fps \"performance mode\" would be added at some point after release - although it's doubtful many were expecting it to take five moths to arrive.\r\n\n\r\nRedfall's performance mode comes as part of a substantial update for Xbox Series X/S and PC touching on everything from gameplay and performance to accessibility. Patch notes promise \"improved PC performance and stability across a wide range of hardware configurations\", for instance, alongside fixes for memory crashes and graphical corruption on AMD GPUs.\r\n \nRead more",

It is by Out of the Blue, the same studio that gave us 2020's rather special Call of the Sea, and set in the \"retro-futuristic '70 metropolis\" Arcadia.\r\n\n\r\nOn the outside, Arcadia seems to promise its residents a life of cushy luxury, but all is not what it seems. In fact, the Arcadia residents are all part of a TV show, and they have no idea they are being recorded for the entertainment of the wider public (think The Truman Show). But, it is not all as innocent as that (not that that is especially innocent, really). You see, if the viewers don't like someone, well, it could end in their death.

Now, another rock has made its way onto that already bumpy road, with developer Starbreeze announcing it has chosen to delay its upcoming patch. \r\n\n\r\nThis patch was initially meant to be released yesterday, 5th October, and address \"200+ QoL-improvements for all platforms\". However, the developer has pushed it back until an unspecified time in mid-October. This, the Payday 3 team has said, is to \"ensure its stability\".\r\n\n\r\n\"The patch needs some changes that would require us to go through console certification again,\" Starbreeze explained. In a follow up post, the team confirmed that this will mean the game's \"PS5 bonus content will remain unredeemable until this patch is ready\".\r\n \nRead more",

From tech giants such as Microsoft and Epic Games down to development studios such as Telltale Games, the bad news just keeps on coming. \nWe discussed the job losses at Creative Assembly last week following the cancellation of Hyenas. Since then, we've heard of deep cuts at Team17, and more job losses on Dragon Age.

          "description": "This year's MineCon Live - developer Mojang's annual celebration of all things Minecraft - is right around the corner, and ahead of the big day on 15th October, the studio is holding its yearly mob vote, with choice number one having now been revealed as the crab.\r\n\n\r\nMinecraft's annual mob vote, if you're unfamiliar, gives players the chance to collectively decide on the creature they'd like to see added to the blockbusting survival sandbox next. Previously mob votes have resulted in the likes of the Glow Squid, Panda, Phantom, Llama, and Sniffer all ending up in-game, and the crab is now vying for a place in that illustrious line-up.\r\n\n\r\nAs per Mojang's animated video introducing the crab, should voters shunt the little fella into first place, it'll be found within the mangrove swamp biome. We're also told about its crab claw, which, once acquired, will enable players to place blocks further away than would normally be possible - a bit of a builder-focused utility, then, this one.\r\n \nRead more",

The likes of co-op play, new buildings, new production chains, and other improvements are expected to arrive in the six months or so of development planned ahead of a full 1.0 release.\r\n \nRead more",

So, get ready to grab your Crewmates and then subsequently betray them all with a quick slice here or a subtle tongue impaling here. You know, as you do. \r\n\n\r\nWhen Among Us makes its way onto PS VR2, players can expect the usual likes of tasks, sabotages, venting, and those frantic emergency meetings where accusations begin to fly left, right and centre. But in addition to all this, Among Us VR on PS VR2 will also include new tasks and new features designed specfically for virtual reality. This includes 3D cosmetics, proximity voice chat, accessibility and comfort settings, safety and in-game moderation tools, crossplay compatibility, and custom lobby settings. \r\n \nRead more",

Here, the goal is to scavenge resources then escape back to safety, but other players and, of course, the AI-controlled undead, won't make that an easy task. \r\n\n\r\nMintrocket stresses that zombies in Nakwon are very much the hunters, and cannot be defeated. Instead, players - primarily armed with makeshift weaponry and tools rather than undead-shredding firepower, given the scarcity of guns - must navigate the streets as stealthily as possible to avoid detection, fleeing when necessary. And should they successfully make it back to the safe zone alive (it looks like players can come and go as they like, regardless of what other Survivors might be doing) the Simulation side of Nakwon begins.\r\n \nRead more",

And ahead of its arrival, Netflix has shared a fresh trailer showcasing its chaotic action, this one welcoming Rayman and a bunch of other familiar Ubisoft faces.\r\n\n\r\nCaptain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix takes its cue from Ubisoft's gleefully ludicrous, 80s-inspired Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon. It's set in an alternate version of Earth's 1992 where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data.\r\n\n\r\nEnter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before sailing off into the sunset with his boyfriend Alex. Unfortunately, Laserhawk is betrayed by said boyfriend, landing him in high-security facility with no choice but to join forces with an unlikely bunch of rebels.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Roughly two years after Netflix announced plans for a Tomb Raider anime, we've finally been given our first look at Lara Croft in cartoon action. \r\n\n\r\nThe Tomb Raider animation is set to focus on the events following the reboot trilogy's conclusion. Lara has returned from her travels in South America, having prevented an apocalypse of some description, and is now ready for her next adventure. \r\n\n\r\nNetflix's debut trailer is quite brief, featuring a lot of heavy breathing from our heroine over the top of a handful of impactful shots. We get to see Lara abseiling into a cavernous abyss and - perhaps in homage to one of Shadow of the Tomb Raider's better moments - emerging onto the scene while a backdrop of flames silhouettes her (presumably) rather battle weary figure. There is also a nice little nod to the Yamatai crew from the 2013 reboot, with Lara tenderly stroking a photo of her fallen friends (although, no Alex? And, I know Jonah is still alive).\r\n \nRead more",

Citing undisclosed \"sources\", the website says Far Cry 7, codenamed Project Blackbird, will feature a \"non-linear\" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.\r\n\n\r\nSupposedly, the main goal of Far Cry 7 is to bring down the Sons of Truth, described as a \"conspiracy group\", within that time frame (the timer is said to stop while within certain locations, such as safehouses), but it's claimed players will also need to track down and rescue their family members along the way in order to \"100%\" the game.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Exploring Starfield's planets was previously a lot harder, Bethesda has revealed, before the developer decided to dial back some \"very punitive\" atmosphere effects.\r\n\n\r\nThe Bethesda space RPG's many planets still feature environmental hazards, such as extreme temperatures and radiation. But the impact these have on your character is now fairly minimal - whereas previously this system would have seen players having to swap spacesuits to meet local conditions.\r\n\n\r\nBethesda boss Todd Howard revealed the change during an episode of the Game Maker's Notebook podcast, which is well worth a watch. In it, Howard discusses the challenges of creating interesting planets, fun space combat, and what changed during Starfield's development.\r\n \nRead more",

The end result was an experience that thoroughly reinvigorated the two-decade old classics, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman even going as far as to call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 \"one of the best games of the generation\".\r\n\n\r\nIn the three years since its record-breaking release, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has made the jump to Switch, and developer Vicarious Visions (the esteemed studio responsible for the superb remakes) was merged into Blizzard - a move that sadly meant a planned Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 ultimately never saw the light of day.\r\n \nRead more",

Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle 'rooms' that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress.\r\n\n\r\nAs for The Talos Principle 2, it sounds like players can expect more of the same, and generally more all round. Croteam is promising new abilities, including gravity manipulation and mind transference, on top of the mechanics seen in the first game, and it'll all take place across \"more than a dozen\" new environments - said to be hiding long-buried secrets and forgotten history - that range from a city on the brink of a paradigm shift to the landscapes of a mysterious island.\r\n \nRead more",

After significant outrage from the development community, with many accusing Unity of a betrayal of trust, the company changed course, saying its new pricing plan would now only apply to developers choosing to use its next Long Term Support version - but, as highlighted by developer Neognosis in a post announcing the cancellation of a Switch port for its acclaimed F-Zero-inspired racer BallisticNG, many developers might not have a choice but to upgrade.\r\n \n\r\n\"Nintendo has a rolling Unity version requirement for game releases,\" the studio explained, \"and we're already behind the threshold by two years. Two weeks ago this wouldn't have been an issue... [but] by the time we'll have a Switch version of BallisticNG ready, the threshold for Unity versions will exceed the new versions that Unity are pushing their TOS changes with, and we currently have no confidence that they won't try pulling another move or pushing back to their original plans under/beyond this new TOS.\"\r\n \nRead more",
