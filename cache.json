Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker&#8217;s RSA private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware. It is expected that our method can be used to reduce the damage caused by Hive ransomware...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "After more than 24 hours offline - rendering a game whose single-player mode needs an internet connection almost entirely unplayable - Gran Turismo 7's big patch is finally live and, as feared, it nerfs the credit payout of several events that had become favourite grinding spots for players. \nIt's a move that has caused considerable consternation amongst the Gran Turismo community, and understandably so given the ability to buy in-game currency on the PlayStation Store, with the game's miserly in-game economy seemingly pushing players towards microtransactions. It's feedback that hasn't gone unnoticed, with the update accompanied by a note from series creator Kazunori Yamauchi.\nRead more",

          "description": "Still hungering for more indie-flavoured video game news following last night's big Xbox showcase? Well, you're in luck, courtesy of Humble Games, which has just given its slate of upcoming titles an airing in a series of its own reveals. And if you missed it, you can catch up with everything the publisher shared by perusing the words below.\nThings got off to an exciting start with in the form of Monaco 2, the sequel to Pocketwatch Games' acclaimed heist caper. Unsurprisingly, chaotic heists remain the focus in this follow-up, but there's a new emphasis on verticality in the procedurally generated stages - made possible thanks to a visual style shift to fully, isometric 3D. It'll also be playable solo and co-operatively, although probably not for some time, given it's still \"early\" in development.\nRead more",

Capcom reminds players that Sunbreak can be accessed after completing the 7-star hub quest Serpent Goddess of Thunder in the base game and that a selection of powerful support items are now available to players via a recent free update should they want to accelerate their progress in preparation for the expansion.\nRead more",

The caveat, of course, is that their mere existence as references in Aperture Desk Job's code doesn't mean these are actual games still in development (particularly given Valve's well-reported experiment-then-ditch approach to game design), or that they'll ever see that light of day.

Being able to spec out a humble Toyota Aqua until it's race ready is a fun experience, but there's one problem - it's kind of ruining the multiplayer experience at the moment. \nGran Turismo 7's online offering is near identical to that seen in the multiplayer-focussed Gran Turismo Sport - hence the multiplayer mode being called simply Sport - in that there are daily races that rotate in and out with various requirements. Previously, these races were typically subject to a Balance of Performance, or BoP - a term borrowed from real-life GT racing that operates along similar lines, with the game ensuring all cars entered have a similar performance to ensure close racing.\nRead more",

If you missed that, though, the first big addition comes in the form of six Spanish-style sea forts dotted around the map. These imposing edifices, sucked into the Sea of Thieves as part of the game's new ongoing storyline, essentially function as solo-friendly, on-demand World Events, serving up a swifter, more streamlined experience compared to the likes of Skeleton Forts.\nRead more",
