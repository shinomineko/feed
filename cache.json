But we do basically the same thing in museums and hang the assets right out on the wall. So it&#8217;s our job, then, to either use technology or develop technology that protects the art, to hire honest guards that are trainable and able to meet the challenge and alert and so forth. And we have to keep them alert because it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s most boring job. It might be great for you to go to a museum and see it for a day, but they stand in that same gallery year after year, and so they get mental fatigue.

From the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</p></blockquote>",

Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</p></blockquote>",

Not only is it described as a \"merry and macabre point and click adventure game\" by its developers, but it also happens to have Jonathan Ackley (Curse of Monkey Island's co-director) giving it his seal of approval. Colour me interested!\r\n\n\r\nThe game in question is Foolish Mortals, and it comes from the minds at Inklingwood Studios - you can see a teaser for it below. Heavily inspired by the Monkey Island series, this game takes place in an exotic locale and, as luck would have it, there is a demo for it available right now on Steam. So, of course, I headed on over to give this upcoming release a whirl. \r\n \nRead more",

Now, in honour of this occasion, Breath of the Wild modders have released a new fan-made DLC for the game known as \"The Halloween Hunt\".\r\n\nWaikuteru (whose name you may recognise from the Breath of the Wild 'Second Wind' mod) worked with fellow modder Sockpoppet to create this haunting DLC. It includes new challenges, armour, weapons and NPCs. Oh, and there is also a new boss to defeat - The Phantom Rider.\r\n\n\r\n\"The time of the year has come and so came the mysterious creature too,\" proclaims a bodiless voice in the DLC. This voice then bids Link to make haste to Korok Forest,  to help these spirits of Hyrule before it is \"too late\". \r\n \nRead more",

It's changed in barely noticeable increments since then, lagging far behind Valve's recent major overhaul for Steam's desktop mode, but as of today, it's out with the old and in with the new. \r\n\n\r\nJust as it promised last July, Valve has now replaced the old Big Picture mode with the far more modern UI created for its handheld gaming PC, Steam Deck. \"This controller-first interface was designed for Steam Deck in handheld and docked mode,\" Valve explains, \"and is perfect for all the scenarios Big Picture mode currently handles.\"\r\n \nRead more",

The changes were made in response to feedback from the beta.\r\n\n\r\nThe biggest change is the addition of diamond icons above enemy heads to increase visibility. \r\n\n\r\nIn the beta, there was no indicator to differentiate between friendly and enemy players. This was traditionally achieved through name tags in previous games, but Infinity Ward took the design decision to remove them, seemingly to add to realism. Players didn't take kindly to the change and called for the return of name tags. Diamond icons are therefore a compromise between good enemy visibility and realism. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "At a launch event in the Stade de France on Thursday, Philips announced a brand new gaming brand, Evnia, with a full lineup of monitors, keyboards, mice and headsets. The name comes from the Greek Εύ and νοια and reportedly translates as 'smart thinking', and plays into an overall wholesome and inclusive vibe with a focus on 'reinventing the rules' of PC peripherals. Ironically, this kind of credo is fairly endemic amongst gaming brands, but Philips has at least made some plays to differentiate themselves, designing products with refreshing off-white/grey colourways, partially built with recycled materials and fronted by Kenyan fighting games pro QueenArrow. \nAs well as offering a bit of a different look to your standard black-and-red gaming gear, the keyboards, mice and headsets announced also held up well in the brief testing session we were afforded, particularly the keyboards that offered some interesting features on top of solid fundamentals. These units were still pre-production models, but there's enough of interest here to mention ahead of their planned release date early next year.  \nFirst up, the SPK8708 full-size mechanical keyboard. Like other high-tier Evnia peripherals, the SPK8708 is a fully wireless model that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, with the former offering lower latency and the latter broader compatibility and longer battery life. Like Philips TVs, it comes with Ambilight branded lighting that spills out behind and around the keyboard, complementing the LEDs behind each keycap. A volume wheel in the upper right corner seemed to have an integrated display inside, which could offer some interesting options along the same lines as the DF-favourite SteelSeries Apex Pro - although it didn't seem to be operational in the unit we had access to. \n Read more",

It's a suitably atmospheric sequence, showing off the remake's various visual upgrades, and one that segues into a chaotic outdoor battle as Leon is swarmed by Ganado. Inevitably, things come to an end with our old friend chainsaw guy - but Leon somehow manages to keep his head on this time around.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing its latest gameplay reveal, Capcom discussed the remake in a little more detail, explaining its goal is to \"[pay] respect to original game's world while implementing new ideas and state of the art graphics to strengthen the core concepts of the title\". This, it say, \"will provide a fresh experience with a sense of familiarity if you played the original, that both newcomers and veterans to Resident Evil 4 will enjoy\".\r\n \nRead more",

Here, we got a glimpse of her early years on the planet of Boreas - as she becomes unwittingly embroiled in an eco-terrorist plot to save Boreas' moon - but developer Respawn's latest trailer skips ahead to Catalyst's Apex Games debut.\r\n\n\r\nThere's a lot for eagle-eyed Apex Legends fans to unpack in the new cinematic trailer - including a fair glimpse at what is almost certainly Season 15's previously teased new moon map - but the focus is very much on Catalyst and her new abilities.\r\n \nRead more",

If one character get captured - horrible things lurk in the shadows - players can switch to another and attempt a rescue, but once all four are dead, the village physically reconfigures itself for another attempt. Thankfully, narrative and puzzle progress is retained across game-overs.\r\n \nRead more",

As such, here is the official announcement to notify you all that, we are changing it\" (thanks, PC Gamer).\nCarter did not elaborate on what the Fallout London team was going to change this all to, instead saying fans would have to hold tight and be patient on this front.

Rumours that the project would be a Silent Hill 2 remake began to coalesce following a series of leaks earlier this year.\r\n\n\r\nNow, though, Konami and Bloober Team have made things official, revealing the remake during a busy Silent-Hill-focused livestream in a two-and-a-half minute trailer. Here, we were shown some iconic Silent Hill 2 moments given a new-gen visual overhaul - extending to a slightly dubious makeover for protagonist James Sunderland, who now looks a little like Alan Wake's unpopular brother.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Gotham Knights will be limited to 30FPS and not include a performance mode for consoles on its release later this month. \r\n\n\r\nThis news was confirmed by Gotham Knights' executive producer Fleur Marty via Discord. Here, Marty explained this was \"due to the types of features\" included in the game, adding the additional option of a performance mode would not have been \"as straightforward as lowering the resolution and getting a higher FPS\".\r\n\n\r\nMarty highlighted the game's \"highly detailed\" open-world setting and its untethered co-op gameplay as two of the reasons the upcoming game does not \"have a performance/quality toggle option\". She concluded by confirming Gotham Knights will run at 30FPS on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 (the developer previously confirmed it had canned the planned PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game). \r\n \nRead more",

So, we're pressing the 'unlaunch' button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th,\" says Nvidia, in a remarkable new blog post that effectively calls a halt to the upcoming launch of its most contentious of RTX 4000 releases, hinting that it'll be renamed when it does eventually re-emerge. RTX 4070 Ti anyone?\nUnveiled by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on September 20th, the RTX 4000 line of graphics hardware is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, fabricated on TSMC's 4nm process. The flagship GPU - the GeForce RTX 4090 - released a couple of days ago and was lauded for its massive generational leap over the existing RTX 3000 flagships, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. However, it's fair to say that the same level of acclaim and anticipation was not bestowed upon the RTX 4080, announced in two very different flavours.\nThe table below reveals that the spec differential wasn't just about the amount of onboard VRAM: each RTX 4080 model was based on an entirely different core processor, with wild variations in the amount of CUDA codes (compute power) and memory bandwidth. In effect, two very different graphics cards were being sold under the same name at very different price-points.\n Read more",

Some of remake's environmental changes have been made to enhance the atmosphere, while other were required to accommodate the fact the Ishimura is now one seamless, interconnected ship, with players no longer needed to rely on the tram to get around.\r\n \nRead more",

The event's first half, running from October 20th to 27th, features the arrival of Mega Banette in Mega Raids for the first time, plus the Shiny versions of Noibat and Galarian Yamask. But it also offers some more surprising additions. \r\n\n\r\n These include the decision by developer Niantic to sell not one but two cheap event tickets featuring time-limited quests and rewards, with both a $1 and $5 option available. From the sounds of things, these will each offer different rewards, with the former offering encounters with Yamask, while the pricier option gets you an admittedly very cool animated Halloween lantern avatar item/pose.\r\n\n\r\nNiantic is obviously trying something new here with a pair of different ticket options for the same overall event, as well as the fact these rewards will be time-limited - even if you paid. Typically, event questlines from Special Research remain in-game permanently, allowing you to complete them at your leisure. \r\n \nRead more",

Microsoft stated it was far from the leader in terms of console share and PC games sold, and lacked any real presence on mobile devices. In a particularly eye-opening claim, Microsoft even said PlayStation's userbase would be \"significantly larger\" than Xbox even if every COD player ditched Sony. At the same time, Microsoft also criticised the regulator for appearing to take Sony's own complaints about the deal at face value. \r\n\nIs this fighting talk from Microsoft, or squeaky bum time in Redmond over real concerns the UK will block the deal outright? Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan share their thoughts on whether the deal will go through, what changes  Microsoft could make to get it over the finish line, and whether it should go ahead. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Bart and Milhouse often have a rough time of it throughout The Simpsons' many episodes and seasons. The duo can regularily be seen getting into all sorts of exploits that often result in them losing girls, getting wedgies and a myriad of other such fiascos. Remember that time Bart sold his soul to Milhouse? That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. \nHowever, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as \"The Springfield Files.\"\n\r\nThis episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer's conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out. But that is not what we are here to talk about. Rather, I want to remind you all of the arcade game Milhouse plays in this episode - Kevin Costner's Waterworld. \r\n \nRead more",

This, he said, was a little tricky to answer insofar as different people will likely have different definitions of \"hard sci-fi\", but for Bethesda, \"It is more hard to us, where you can draw that line from, okay, here's how man explored space, and [then] look at our ships and say, alright that has some visual identity back to that\".\r\n\n\r\nHowever, he also called the question a bit of a trap, \"because it's a video game.
