But in 2013, Edward Snowden disclosed that the National Security Agency had subverted the integrity of a NIST cryptographic standard­the Dual_EC_DRBG­enabling easy decryption of supposedly secured communications. This discovery reinforced the desire of some public and private entities to develop their own cryptographic standards instead of relying on a U.S. government process.

While such devices enable us to train large-scale neural networks in datacenters and deploy them on edge devices, their designers&#8217; focus so far is on average-case performance. In this work, we introduce a novel threat vector against neural networks whose energy consumption or decision latency are critical. We show how adversaries can exploit carefully-crafted sponge examples, which are inputs designed to maximise energy consumption and latency, to drive machine learning (ML) systems towards their worst-case performance. Sponge examples are, to our knowledge, the first denial-of-service attack against the ML components of such systems. We mount two variants of our sponge attack on a wide range of state-of-the-art neural network models, and find that language models are surprisingly vulnerable. Sponge examples frequently increase both latency and energy consumption of these models by a factor of 30×. Extensive experiments show that our new attack is effective across different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU and an ASIC simulator) on a wide range of different language tasks. On vision tasks, we show that sponge examples can be produced and a latency degradation observed, but the effect is less pronounced. To demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge examples in the real world, we mount an attack against Microsoft Azure&#8217;s translator and show an increase of response time from 1ms to 6s (6000×). We conclude by proposing a defense strategy: shifting the analysis of energy consumption in hardware from an average-case to a worst-case perspective...</p></blockquote>",

Nestled on the banks of Lake LaSuli, this small town plays home to more than just the local high school; it also incorporates a library, the principal's lavish mansion, a thrift store/boba hangout known as ThrifTea, and an amusement park, complete with haunted house, tunnel of love, ferris wheel, and photo booth.\r\n \nRead more",

That's massive for owners of AMD GPUs, and the mod even works beautifully on Steam Deck. \nWe contacted the mod's creator, the gloriously named PotatoOfDoom1337, to find out exactly how it works - and whether it means that FSR 2.0 will soon be available in a tonne of existing games. Here's the interview, edited lightly for clarity. Enjoy!\n\nWhat's your background in programming and game modding?

          "description": "First impressions of Sonic Frontiers have, it's fair to say, been mixed - but Sega is forging ahead regardless, now offering a look at the game's rendition of Cyber Space, where more \"traditional, fast-paced\" Sonic stages can be found.\r\n\n\r\nRevealed during today's busy Nintendo Direct, Cyber Space is a mysterious digital realm that can be reached by uncovering ancient entrances around Starfall Islands - a cluster of landmasses incorporating Kronos Island, the lush area seen in Sonic Frontiers' divisive first trailers. \r\n\n\r\nIn order to unlock the Cyber Space entrances, players will first need to earn Portal Gears by solving puzzles and completing challenges around the \"open zone\" map. Once in Cyber Space, they can try their hand at \"traditional, fast-paced, speed running action platforming\" - linear stages more in line with classic Sonic action - earning Vault Keys required to progress further.\r\n \nRead more",

Developer Runic Games' Torchlight, for instance, is an enjoyable Diablo-esque dungeon-crawler from 2009. This isn't the first time it's appeared as part of Xbox Games with Gold though (it was last available in July 2019), so it's entirely possible this one is already hanging around your library.\r\n\n\r\nThrillville: Off the Rails, meanwhile, is the 2007 sequel to Frontier Developments' Thrillville, an attempt at creating a more accessible spin on the classic theme park sim genre. \"It's not complex, it's not challenging, but it's not trying to be,\" said Eurogamer in its review. \"It's an enjoyable family game which also has appeal for retro gaming fans and drunk people.\"\r\n \nRead more",

It was a bit of a surprise, then, when Nightdive's long-awaited Enhanced Edition of Blade Runner resurfaced earlier this month with a 23rd June release date, but perhaps less of a surprise, given its history, when the remaster launched to less-than-stellar reviews.\r\n\n\r\nFor those that purchased the game via GOG, there was some respite in that all copies of the remaster came with the previously available ScummVM version, developed by a dedicated group of enthusiasts. Steam purchasers, however, were stuck with Nightdive's inferior remaster - until today, that is, when the studio revealed it would adding the ScummVM version as an alternative download for all purchases.\r\n \nRead more",

Here's the full list of tweaks and adjustments, for the curious, as per the Fall Guys Twitter account:\nFall Guys' transition to a free-to-pay model seems to have paid off for Mediatonic. Despite some server wobbles on launch day, the developer reported Fall Guy's new monetisation model - combined with its launch on two new platforms in Xbox and Switch - managed to push the game's player base over the 20m mark just 24 hours after its free-to-play release.\n Read more",

As such, Mario fans were somewhat aghast last year when Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto announced Pratt would be replacing Martinet as the voice of Mario in the upcoming film.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a casting decision that few seemed to have warmed to even ten months on, despite the best efforts of Chris Meledandri, producer of the Super Mario film, who insisted Pratt's performance as Mario was \"phenomenal\" last November. Meledandri then defended his star again this week, saying criticism of Pratt's casting would \"evaporate\" when people heard his performance.\r\n \nRead more",

The goal remains the same each play-through, in that players must use their investigatory skills to identify and hunt down a number of replicants, but exactly which characters are replicants is determined at the start of a new game, subtly changing their behaviour as the story unfolds.\r\n \nRead more",

Several celebrity-voiced friends are along for the ride, as is the irrepressible Tina, as Dungeon Master.\r\n \nRead more",

Now, however, one enterprising YouTuber has taken up the challenge of downsizing the machine to create the \"world's first PS5 Slim console\" - one that's less than 2cm thick.\r\n\n\r\nThe project is the work of YouTube channel DIY Perks, which specialises in videos about designing and building gadgets and technology at home, and begins with a tear-down of Sony's behemoth console to figure exactly which of its innards should stay and wish can go to hit that 2cm target.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of the PS5's bulk comes from its steel shrouding and CPU-cooling heatsink, and with those gone, DIY Perk's target seems a little closer to reality. Ultimately, to hit that magic number, PS5's existing cooling solution is replaced with a custom water-channeling system made from copper sheeting. It's not a cheap option, costing an eyewatering $240 for the sheeting alone, but it appears to do the job.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Following its Xbox, PlayStation, and PC debut last month, Ubisoft's free-to-play 3v3 skater Roller Champions has been given a Switch release date, and will, according to a new UK eShop listing, arrive on Nintendo's platform tomorrow, 21st June.\r\n\n\r\nRoller Champions is Ubisoft's stab at creating its own chaotic sports mash-up in the vein of Rocket League, albeit one that switches out the latter's cars-meet-football concept for a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football.\r\n\n\r\nThe gist is that two teams of three players hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another. When one team finally has the ball, they need to complete at least one lap before pelting it into the goal, with additional points accrued the more laps they can keep hold of it before taking a successful shot.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Despite its controversial launch, Diablo Immortal - Blizzard's pocket-sized Diablo experience - has generated almost £20 million ($24m) since it launched earlier this month.\r\n\nAccording to the analysts at Appmagic (thanks, Pocket Gamer), that makes Diablo Immortal - which has been downloaded over eight million times in just a fortnight - one of Blizzard's biggest mobile app, second only to the immense popularity of Hearthstone. \r\n\nThe game has seen its biggest success in the US, which accounts for 26 per cent of all downloads. This is followed by South Korea, Brazil, and Japan, with 11 per cent, 8 per cent, and 8 per cent of the market share respectively. The UK only features in the 17 per cent \"other\" category which aggregates low-level figures across the rest of the world. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Earlier this month, developer Supermassive released its sumputous slasher horror The Quarry on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in collaboration with publisher 2K Games - but a new report has claimed the game was originally in development as a \"signature\" title for Stadia, before Google made the decision to downsize its gaming operation and send the project elsewhere.\r\n\n\r\nStadia, of course, launched to much fanfare in 2019, and part of Google's promise to early adopters was that the service would bring its own console-like exclusives from both first- and third-parties. To that end, Google established its own internal game development studio and signed deals with external developers, including Supermassive, as announced in 2020.\r\n\n\r\nThose plans, however, changed dramatically just 14 months after Stadia's high-profile arrival, with Google announcing a major rethink of its cloud streaming strategy following a less-than-stellar launch, which included the cancellation of all internal game development as it began prioritising selling its tech to third-parties.\r\n \nRead more",

Cloaking, meanwhile, makes it impossible for detected cheaters to see opponents and bullets, or even hear sounds.\r\n \nRead more",

That's a little different for season 1, however, with Blizzard promising three new heroes, six new maps, the new Push game mode, weekly challenges, 30+ new skins, and a new mythic skin when things get underway on 4th October in tandem with Overwatch 2's early access launch. \r\n \nRead more",

These include \"removable stick units\" - which can be switched in and out using buttons below the analog sticks - plus trigger stops, a seemingly removal grip, and rear buttons that Henderson describes as \"flappy paddles\", presumably similar to those seen on the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Following its long-awaited official unveiling last week, Naughty Dog has given another glimpse of its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for PS5 and PC, this time showcasing what it calls a \"glow up\" for supporting character Tess.\r\n\n\r\nDuring last week's Summer Game Fest reveal, one of key arguments Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann made for remaking the original Last of Us - a game that already got the remaster treatment in 2014 - was that the additional power of modern hardware would enable it to get closer to its \"original vision\". The studio specifically highlighted the remake's rebuilt character models and faces, which it said would better reflect the cast's original performances.\r\n\n\r\nInevitably, the remake's character changes have come as something of a shock to fans who've grown attached to the original versions over the last nine years, with both Joel and Ellie now sporting more realistic facial makeovers that age them notably. That's especially true for Naughty Dog's latest reveal, showcasing the new version of Joel's friend Tess, who initially agrees to help smuggle Ellie out of the city.\r\n \nRead more",

It certainly looks different to everything else out there.\nThe game is led by Obsidian star director Josh Sawyer (Fallout: new Vegas, Pillars of Eternity) and is apparently an idea he pitched years and years ago at Black Isle Studios, according to IGN, which interviewed Sawyer about his new game. \n Read more",

          "description": "Microsoft showed a new trailer for A Plage Tale: Requiem during the Games Showcase today, giving us another rare look at gameplay in the upcoming sequel, due sometime this year on Xbox Consoles, PC and Game Pass at launch. It's also coming to PS5 but obviously Microsoft glossed over that bit.\nThe thing that really stuck out to me, a fan of the first game, was stabbing. Amicia, the returning older sister of brother Hugo, and our hero, can now approach enemies from the back and stealth-kill them, reaching over and stabbing them multiple times in the neck - the kind of gruesome move we've seen many times in other stealth combat games. Except A Plague Tale, the first game, wasn't really a stealth combat game - it was more about running away and hiding and being smart. That's what made it stand out. \nAmicia also packs a crossbow in the sequel, which she uses, and she can garrotte people with some chord. All she had in the first game was a slingshot, which wasn't entirely capable of one-shot kills. It was more of a utility/distraction tool.\n Read more",

It's the most technically advanced racing game ever apparently, so that's exciting. We also got told about its dynamic time of day feature, the weather for each track and the inclusion of raytracing. This was all shown off with a clip from the fictional circuit known as Maple Valley.\nThe twosome also says there's a 48x improvement in the accuracy of the simulation - but, as Martin has asked, what does that mean, and how does it feel?

We start approaching a spooky church and then head up into the spire where vampires are leaping about. Shotguns and nice vampire-burning-up effects ensue, and then we're off to learn a bit about the town.\r\n\n\r\nThe titular Redfall is an island community in Massachusets apparently, but now the whole place has gone to heck. Vampires have blocked out the sun, drained all the water, and cut the town off. (Wouldn't draining the water do the opposite?)

That in itself was enough to cause many to raise an eyebrow, as while the game certainly does look smoother thanks to its current gen make-over, it is also a game that has been released twice before.\nToday, we now have even more information on this release, such as the three editions that will be released. And I am sorry to say this folks, but that £70/$70 will only get you the base game and its prequel Left Behind. If you want to get your hands on the The Last of Us Part 1's  Digital Deluxe edition, you are going to have to part ways with £80/$80. Meanwhile, if you are looking to purchase The Last of Us Part I Firefly Edition, which is only available to buy as an exclusive directly from PlayStation in the US, you are looking at just shy of $100.\nSo, what exactly do you get with these editions to make them worth the money?\n Read more",

Indeed, those that stuck around once Keighley had done his thing this evening would have immediately been greeted by a slew of intriguing new indie titles, courtesy of this year's Day of the Devs showcase - and if you missed it, the whole thing can be perused in one convenient, easily digestible round-up below. \r\n\nTime Flies\n\n\r\nTime Flies is the work of Michael Frei and Mario von Rickenbach, the developers behind the acclaimed Kids, and explores the limited time we have on Earth from the perspective of a fly. After entering your location, you're allotted a set amount of time (based on your country's average life expectancy) to explore the inside of a house and puzzle out ways to complete a bucket list of activities, ranging from getting rich to making a friend. Time Flies is coming to Playstation, Switch, PC, and Mac next year.\r\n \nRead more",

Take a look:\nFor the curious, Darktide is a spiritual follow-up to Fatshark's previous four-player co-op games, Warhammer: Vermintide and Vermintide 2, which are a bit like medieval Left 4 Deads but with giant rats. This one's set in the even grimmer and darker universe of the year 40K.\nAnd it's all quite supremely 40K, by the looks of things. We get a nice glimpse of the four classes - Psyker, Veteran, Zealot, Ogryn - blowing apart the hordes of cultists-cum-space-zombies in different ways.\n Read more",

And not only is it really real, but it will also be releasing as soon as 2nd September for the PlayStation 5 at a retail price of $70. \nTo accompany this news, we got our first look at the remake in action thanks to a brand-new trailer. You can check it out for yourself by following this link.\nAs you can see, the Ellie and Joel that we first met all the way back in 2013 now have a much sleeker look, but it is most certainly still them. There is fighting, there is compassion, and there are enough clickers to give one spores for thought throughout this reveal. Rather nicely, the game's DLC - Left Behind - will also be included in this remake. \n Read more",

          "description": "With last night's trailer reveal for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, fans of Activision's largest franchise were left with sour taste after discovering the publisher has raised the price of last-gen versions of the game. \r\n\n\r\nPre-ordering the game for either PlayStation 4 or Xbox One will cost players £69.99. That's a hefty £10 increase from the asking for price for the franchise's last title: Vanguard. \r\n\n\r\nThe price rise is explained by the fact players are now forced to purchase the \"Cross-Gen Bundle,\" which includes both the last-gen and current-gen versions of the game. \r\n \nRead more",

Eurogamer's Wesley Yin-Poole even went as far as to call it a \"bizarre, boring, broken mess\" before slapping it with an avoid badge.\r\n\n\r\nNow, a lengthy new report from Kotaku - based on conversations with 10 former employees of Bethesda and parent company ZeniMax Media - has shed fresh light on the troubled development that lead to such a poorly received game, one seemingly doomed from the start.\r\n \nRead more",

Reportedly, this somewhat radical shift in focus for the series was to ensure a too-similar sequel didn't eat into the original mini-game compilation's ongoing sales.\r\n \nRead more",

It adds new enemies, fancy new building blocks and some odd new structures, left by past explorers. It's something fans have been wanting to dig into for some time.\r\n\n\r\nMojang originally announced Deep Dark almost two years ago, back at Minecraft Live in 2020. At the time, the biome was set to be part of the game's 2021 Caves and Cliffs Update (an offering that was further reshuffled after Caves and Cliffs was split in two). So, why the delay? What's been happening with Minecraft in the interim? And what's going on with that Jason Momoa Minecraft movie? I sat down with Minecraft's game director Agnes Larsson and gameplay developer Ulraf Vakninthe to find out more.\r\n\n\r\n\"We felt for a while 'this is a risk but we might be able to do it',\" Larsson told me, of Deep Dark's original intended release date. \"But then when we realised [we had to delay], we tried to take the decision really quickly because we would risk making people in the team very, very stressed out. And we also communicated about it really quickly because we wanted to be as transparent as possible about such a big decision. \r\n \nRead more",

A mysterious stranger named Rhi, who looks to be a new ally, has instead taken Willow's place while players investigate the emergence of the first Ultra Beasts. \r\n\n\r\nThese creatures are likely the cause of Willow's absence, and will hopefully be a continued focus over the game's new Season of Go. For now at least, Willow's absence appears to be a story development that will stick for some time, with standard in-game text changed throughout the app to remove references to the professor. (For those overly concerned, a Go Fest finale event for existing ticket holders, coming in August, seems likely to revolve around his revival.)\r\n \nRead more",
