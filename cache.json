Here&#8217;s one more contribution to that issue: a <a href=\"https://static.rusi.org/247-op-cyber-insurance-v2.pdf\">research paper</a> that the insurance industry is hurting more than it&#8217;s helping.</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, the most pressing challenge currently facing the industry is ransomware. Although it is a societal problem, cyber insurers have received considerable criticism for facilitating ransom payments to cybercriminals. These add fuel to the fire by incentivising cybercriminals&#8217; engagement in ransomware operations and enabling existing operators to invest in and expand their capabilities. Growing losses from ransomware attacks have also emphasised that the current reality is not sustainable for insurers either...</p></blockquote>",

It appears the previous record was held by speedrunner dodai, who achieved a time of 14 minutes and 46 seconds back in 2016. \nThis all sounds impressive on paper, but the run itself makes for remarkable viewing: at one point Crescendo has to accurately count down the seconds needed to run a sufficient distance before making a series of perfect jumps. He uses fireballs as an echolocation device, and is able to figure out his surroundings from the noise they make when hitting a wall. He also seems to break bricks to figure out his position. \nRead more",

Then, in 2020, PUBG Mobile was banned across the entire country following increased tensions between China and India. As the game was published by Chinese company Tencent, PUBG Mobile was included in the list of 118 apps banned in India over security concerns. \nBut it seems PUBG Corp wasn't quite ready to give up, and a new version of the game is already seeing massive success. \nBattlegrounds Mobile India is the new (but still not particularly catchy) name of PUBG Mobile in India, and it's off to a roaring start. The game launched on 2nd July, and now has 34 million registered players, 16m daily active users, and a peak concurrent player count of 2.4 million. And apparently it's not even on the Apple App Store yet (via Times of India).  \nRead more",

          "description": "Respawn has been battling hackers in its online games for some time, but the situation escalated recently when hackers blocked players from accessing Apex Legends in order to complain about hacking in Titanfall. And unfortunately it seems the saga is having an impact on Respawn's development plans, with work on at least one highly-anticipated feature for Apex Legends, cross-progression, slowed by the recent spate of attacks.  \nEarlier this week Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier responded to a question about cross-progression on Twitter, explaining that \"recent hacks on Apex and TF have slowed down the progress of it\". He added that the studio needed to \"context switch to solving live game issues\". \nAlthough cross-platform play was implemented in Apex Legends last year, players have so far been unable to transfer progress between accounts on different platforms (aside from moving between Steam and Origin). It's a feature the team seems eager to introduce, with Grenier explaining via Reddit that implementing it will be \"much harder post-launch since users may have multiple accounts to merge or use\". Given the ongoing problems with hacking in Apex Legends and the Titanfall games, it sounds like it could be a little while longer before we see this feature implemented.     \nRead more",

Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City comes to Apple Arcade on 16th July.\nThe Lost City is a sort of revisiting of the original game, allowing players to \"venture deeper into the endless desert to uncover its best-kept secret.\" The game adds a new biome - the Lost city - and expands upon the original design with new secrets and challenges. The idea is to give returning players something fresh to tease at, while allowing new players to see what the game's all about in the first place.\nThe teaser trailer promises lavish mystery and paper lanterns - always a lovely mix. If you have played the original game, your save data will carry across too, which is pretty great. Can't wait for this one.\nRead more",

And the tantalising glimpses continued tonight with nine new minutes of gameplay footage, as shown during Sony's latest PlayStation State of Play.\nFirst, the basic premise for those unfamiliar; in Deathloop, players take on the role of Colt, an assassin who finds himself trapped in an endless time loop on the mysterious Blackreef island. In order to escape, he'll need to take out eight targets known as the Visionaries before the day ends - but if he fails (or dies) time rewinds and he'll need to start over.\nAll isn't lost, however; by exploring further in each successive loop, players can gain valuable clues they'll be able to use next time around to locate and eliminate their targets before the day ends - and Arkane's latest gameplay footage focusses on an attempt to bring down the Visionary known as Aleksis \"The Wolf\" Dorsey.\nRead more",

And what do you know? Megagon's newest update is here to do just that, wafting away the threat of encroaching staleness with a range of new Daily Ride challenge modifiers.\nDaily Rides, if you've not yet checked them out, are daily cross-platform leaderboards that challenge players to do their best in a randomly selected trial, with participants able to unlock various cosmetic rewards, refreshed each season, along the way. Today's update marks the start of Lonely Mountains' seventh season, Summer Strolls, and introduces those aforementioned modifiers to freshen things up for players.\nToday's Daily Ride, for instance, rolls out the new Changed Checkpoints modifier - which, as its name suggests, changes and adds new checkpoints to the trail - but future modifiers for the season have also been revealed (and you can see a few of them in the trailer below).\nRead more",

          "description": "Dark Souls 3 has just received a new lease of life on Xbox Series consoles, thanks to the transformative powers of FPS Boost. The From Software classic now targets 60 frames per second on the new wave of Microsoft consoles, replacing the somewhat wobbly 30fps of the Xbox One rendition of the game. We had early access to the FPS Boosted rendition of the game and it certainly does the job, delivering nigh-on flawless performance on Xbox Series consoles.\nThis is a much-requested upgrade for Xbox Series X and S owners, bringing the game closer into line with its performance profile on PS5. Dark Souls 3 released on last-gen systems in 2016 with a firm 30fps cap, but many months later, a PlayStation 4 Pro patch removed the limit, offering frame-rates up to 60fps. Unfortunately, the value of the upgrade was questionable at the time, owing to a highly variable level of performance on Sony's enhanced machine. However, in the long run, it worked out - PlayStation 5's backwards compatibility horsepower locks the game to 1080p60.\nUnfortunately, From Software never went back to the Xbox One version of Dark Souls 3 to add One X support, meaning that 900p30 has been the upper limit of performance on Xbox consoles since the game's original launch. Not only that, in common with From's other 30fps console offerings, inconsistent frame-pacing added a certain degree of judder to the game, something baked into the engine that extra back-compat horsepower could not address. Today's FPS Boost upgrade overrides the frame-rate cap to give Xbox Series X and S the same, smooth experience 60fps as PS5, with no judder, hitches or stuttering.\nRead more",

Or be nudists, or drug-stupor mystics, or piratical raiders, or charity-focused givers, or pain-loving animal sacrificers, or dance-party techno ravers, or rustic ranching cowboys, or many many more.\"\nSylvester says it'll be possible to mix and match different core elements of a colony's belief system in Ideology, and that customisation can be taken even further if desired, with the expansion enabling players to individually adjust preferences in the following categories: precept, ritual, special social role, venerated animal and weapon, culture and style, unique building, tattoo, clothing, background narrative, god, and, perhaps most importantly of all, beard (more on those shortly!).\nRead more",

Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has now said he has heard similar.\nThe long wait, Henderson said, was due to a push within developer Rockstar to improve staff welfare and avoid the levels of crunch which have plagued the company over past releases. It is also, Henderson continued, because Rockstar wants to launch GTA6 at a time when the install base for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has grown considerably.\nRead more",

Yet the team decided to try a different tactic to just charging into battle, instead choosing to conga their way out of spawn and onto the control points. And surprisingly, it worked. Stay tuned for the satisfying bot slaughter at the end of the match:  \nThe question you're probably asking right now is: why didn't the bots shoot the Blu team members? The answer, it seems, is that the bots are programmed to avoid shooting players who are using taunts and emotes. If you look closely at the video, you'll notice that players not engaged in the conga line (such as poor old atomdotdat) are instantly sniped by the bots, while the dancers remain unharmed. \nRead more",

Krollywood confirmed in a Reddit comment that the levels have been reuploaded to Far Cry 5's arcade mode under the name \"Golden Cry\". To find them on PS4 you'll need to search for the creator name \"Perfect-Dark1982\", and on PC the creator name is \"Graslu00\".\nKrollywood spent two and a half years recreating the 18 GoldenEye 007 levels in Far Cry 5's level editor, and you can hear a little about how he did it in the video below: \nRead more",

Well... new to PUBG, at least. \nThe freshly-released patch notes explain that Taego is an 8x8 map set in 1980s South Korea, with landscapes \"ranging from wide-open reed fields to the close quarters of Hosan Prison\". It's also got some wildlife, with flocks of birds that react to player movement and gunfire, so take your binoculars with you - those birds might just help you track down another squad. If you stream yourself doing that, you're a twitcher in two senses of the word. \nThe map also has a new feature called Comeback BR, which gives players who die before the first Blue Zone the ability to get themselves back into the game. All you have to do is stay alive in a separate \"Comeback Arena\" for a certain amount of time. It sounds pretty similar to Call of Duty: Warzone's Gulag, except it's more like another mini battle royale rather than a one-on-one battle to the death. Players who survive are reintroduced to the main game in phase three of the match, complete with all their items and gear. \nRead more",

Oh, and I guess this also means that tweeting everything is useful after all. \nAs spotted by Kotaku, Twitter user @lunasorcery explained in a thread that she'd helped a group of Minecraft historians find a long-lost early version of the game. Build Alpha 1.1.1 was apparently a \"long-running meme\" and \"holy grail\" for Minecraft archivist group Omniarchive, as the historians had never been able to track the elusive build down. It was an exceedingly rare version of the game that was released on 18th September 2010, and was only available for three hours and 25 minutes due to a bug that would turn the player's screen grey. \nLuckily, someone spotted a 2010 tweet by Luna in which she discussed the Minecraft update, and messaged her to ask if she had a copy of the build. She initially ignored the message, thinking there was \"no chance in hell\" that she would still have a copy, but last Friday another person contacted her about the tweet - and this prompted her to take a closer look. \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week, Valheim developer Iron Gate rolled out a patch that was intended to provide players with an extra level of challenge: enemies were tweaked to be more aggressive towards structures, meaning players would have to be more proactive about defending their homes. But some players feel Iron Gate went overboard with these changes, highlighting that the patch has resulted in some strange enemy behaviour - along with the wanton destruction of property. \nOver on the Valheim subreddit, players have argued that Valheim's monsters are now too eager to attack buildings, sometimes opting to destroy structures even when standing directly next to the player. This has led to some \"immersion-shattering\" enemy behaviour, with monsters looking uncertain about who they should be attacking. Some players, meanwhile, are simply exasperated at the amount of damage now being caused in monster raids. \n\"Earlier today I had a troll invasion and I had three trolls attacking my base non-stop,\" said Reddit user Squatch11. \"I literally couldn't get them to attack me. Half of my base was destroyed before I managed to kill them.\" \nRead more",

There were other areas of the game that came under fire, including its limited character creator, bugs and animation quirks.\nBeyond that, though, Andromeda's missions, storyline and characters failed to set the world on fire. Without Commander Shepard, the Normandy and the original trilogy's cast of much-loved characters, Andromeda set out for a new galaxy, a new premise and new party members.

          "description": "Good news everyone, Konami's working on a brand new game - other than New Football Game Online Performance Test - and this one certainly looks intriguing. It's a \"mystery simulation game\" called Crimesight, where players must deduce \"not only the culprit, but the victim as well\". What, were you expecting Silent Hill? \nThe social deduction game is set in a futuristic version of London where crimes can be predicted using an \"analytical programme developed using data harvested online\". This has led to reduced crime rates across the world, but the system predicts a crime that could \"plunge the world into chaos\", prompting the system's architects to create an AI called Sherlock to investigate and prevent this crime.\nSherlock must prevent the criminal mastermind AI (named Moriarty, of course) from committing simulated murder, while Moriarty will try to predict the perfect moment to murder an NPC avatar. The trailer explains that Crimesight allows for 2-4 person multiplayer, and that the game takes place on what looks like a virtual tabletop board. \nRead more",

But what does being next-gen exclusive actually mean?\nIn the video below, developer Massive Entertainment discusses how the team has improved its Snowdrop game engine - the one it used to build The Division - to make use of the more powerful hardware.\nThere's a lot of talk about ray tracing and object detail, which is great. And Avatar does look like quite the tech powerhouse - a game that will actually push those next-gen consoles. But my ears were pricked by something Alice Rendell, lead narrative realisation designer, mentioned too: Massive has created a system where NPCs understand the state of the world. For example, they're aware of the weather, player progression and time of day. That sounds pretty cool, and I'm already imagining NPCs complaining about the rain.

HDR allows a supported game to render a much wider range of brightness values and colours. It's a tech already in the Xbox Series X and S. Microsoft mentioned over 1000 games will support auto HDR, including Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, Rocket League, DayZ, and even Doom 64.\nMicrosoft said Windows 11 will load new games faster via tech called DirectStorage. Again, this was a part of Xbox Series X and S tech. DirectStorage means games quickly load assets to the graphics card without bogging down the CPU. Microsoft  said to expect incredibly detailed game worlds rendered at \"lightning speeds\" and without long load times. \"DirectStorage Optimised\" Windows 11 PCs are configured with the hardware and drivers needed to enable this.\nRead more",

Developer Iron Gate is introducing some enemy AI tweaks to make monsters more aggressive, which should encourage them to start barging into your base. How rude.\nThe latest Valheim patch notes explain that the new update will fix several AI issues, with monsters made \"slightly more aggressive\". They will now \"attack your buildings etc. when they are not able to attack you\", meaning you'll probably have to be more proactive in taking out enemies before they destroy your beautiful wooden structures. \"It's fun for the whole family,\" Iron Gate said in the patch notes. (Is it, though?)\nIf you're strolling through the Black Forest, you may also want to watch your head, as the Greydwarfs have had their aim improved - meaning they now have half a chance of actually getting a shot on target.

There's now a tool to control how many times players can change their name in a match, for instance, and for public matchmaking it seems this has been set to zero - thus preventing bots from frequently changing their names or mimicking real players. \nThe update also introduces a grace period at the start of matches to prevent players immediately calling votes, which should put the brakes on bots that are trying to deliberately clog up the vote-kick system. Similarly, players joining an in-progress game will face a cooldown before they can call a vote. Kick votes will also \"end early and automatically pass if the vote target leaves the match during the vote\". \nRead more",

And despite these issues, the game and its DLC are still on sale.\nThe server shutdown began on 1st June, after which players began to report problems accessing DLC areas from the game's The Falcon & The Unicorn expansion. Players who owned the DLC also found they were unable to play past Act 1 of the main game with the expansion installed. Some who bought the deluxe version reported they could no longer access the special in-game items included with that version (via PC Gamer). \nPlayers have been creating their own workarounds for the problems, with some editing NPC dialogue to do so, but so far there hasn't been an official fix.

          "description": "After being interrupted during mining in the Black Forest for the thousandth time, you could be forgiven for wanting to beat up a Greydwarf with your bare hands - and thanks to the work of Valheim's modding community, you now can. Well, while holding VR controllers, I guess. \nVHVR is a community-made VR mod for Valheim that was first released back in April, and did a pretty good job of translating Valehim's Viking world into VR (even if players could only move using a standard gamepad or mouse and keyboard). Here's our own Ian Higton trying it out at the time:\nWork on the mod continued post-launch, and now VHVR has been given a game-changing update that adds motion control support. Thanks to the work of modder Maddy25 (who apparently almost single-handedly implemented many of the motion control systems), you can now interact with items in Valheim more directly. There's upper-body and finger tracking using VRIK, melee combat, bow and arrow controls, fishing, point and click building, and you can use your hands to interact with the environment. There are also custom VR controls for interacting with menus, along with switching and equipping items.\nRead more",

He didn't exactly provide any shocking revelations, but confirmed he'd mainly been involved in the early stages of development and creating the game's fantasy world. \n\"The game is called the Elden Ring and it's a sequel to a video game that came out a few years ago called Dark Souls,\" Martin said. \"My work on it was actually done years ago.

          "description": "If you were wondering just how popular PUBG is on mobile, the answer is: very, as 17 million people have now signed up for upcoming mobile title PUBG: New State. \nPUBG: New State was announced back in February and described as the \"only mobile successor to the original PC version of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\". It's a futuristic version of PUBG set after the events of the original game, in the year 2051. It's supposed to have \"ultra-realistic graphics\" that will surpass \"what was previously possible in mobile gaming graphics\", along with some new game mechanics like dodging, drone calls and support requests. \nPre-registration was opened up following the game's announcement, with players able to register their interest via Google Play and the App Store. And it seems to have received a lot of attention, judging by the numbers announced by PUBG Corp today. \nRead more",

          "description": "Well, another Cyberpunk 2077 patch has arrived, and although this one doesn't bring any spectacular gameplay additions it does promise further bug fixes and stability improvements.\nPatch 1.23 is now live on all platforms, and sorts out a number of quest-specific bugs and general performance issues. The patch itself is apparently rather chunky, with console users reporting a download size of 30GB (my Steam download was a rather more modest 3.45GB).  \nOf note is the paragraph on stability and performance, which says the patch will provide \"numerous crash fixes in animations, UI, scene, physics and gameplay systems\". The patch also promises a reduction in the number of crashes through \"memory optimisations and memory management improvements in various systems\". There's also a vague mention of \"various console CPU optimisations\".\nRead more",

The adverts are first being tested in a game called Blaston by Resolution Games, and will roll out to a couple of other apps \"over the coming weeks\". \nJudging by a gif on the Oculus blog showing an in-headset advert, it looks like players can point at an advert to click on a link or save it for later.

          "description": "While there was plenty to get excited about in Nintendo's busy E3 showcase, one notable absence came in the form of No More Heroes 3 - the latest entry in developer Grasshopper Manufacture's cult-classic action-adventure series - which is coming to Switch in just a few short months. However, Nintendo has now made up for that no-show, sharing 20 minutes of new gameplay in a special Nintendo Treehouse livestream.\nAnnounced back in 2019, No More Heroes 3 - which is set nine years after the events of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle and two years after Travis Strikes Again - once again casts players as otaku and sometime-assassin Travis Touchdown. However, while previous games saw Travis murdering his way to the top of the United Assassins Association league, this third series entry ushers in a new threat, with players now charged with eliminating extraterrestrial enemies in order to reach number one in the Galactic Superhero Rankings.\nAs seen in Nintendo's new \"early look\" at No More Heroes 3, the series' wonderfully satisfying hack-and-slash action - built around Travis' lightsaber-like Beam Katana - makes a return, with no obvious surprises where core mechanics are concerned. Players will again need to combine the likes of basic moves, heavy moves, kicks, blocks, and rolls to defeat enemies (motion controls are optional) with the likes of finishers and jackpot bonuses also returning.\nRead more",
