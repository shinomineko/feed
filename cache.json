Academics at Germany’s Technical University of Darmstadt figured out how to exploit this lack of hardening to run malicious firmware that allows the attacker to track the phone’s location or run new features when the device is turned off.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The research is the first &#8212; or at least among the first &#8212; to study the risk posed by chips running in low-power mode. Not to be confused with iOS&#8217;s low-power mode for conserving battery life, the low-power mode (LPM) in this research allows chips responsible for near-field communication, ultra wideband, and Bluetooth to run in a special mode that can remain on for 24 hours after a device is turned off...</p></blockquote>",

You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don&#8217;t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>\n<p>This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE&#8217;s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government&#8217;s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has &#8212; without any judicial, legislative or public oversight &#8212; reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver&#8217;s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>",

By caching. Apple Mail downloads all images for all emails before you open them.

And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>",

That, however, is no longer the case, with Schofield now saying it's its \"own story and world\".\r\n\n\r\nThe Callisto Protocol is a third-person horror game set in 2320, with its action unfolding within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter's moon Callisto. While that set-up mightn't immediately scream PUBG to onlookers, the connection came from the fact developer Striking Distance was explicitly established by PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton to create narrative-driven games that would expand the universe introduced in the battle royale hit.\r\n\n\r\nAs Schofield explained in a recent GameInformer cover feature on The Callisto Protocol, \"When we came in, [Krafton] had a lore team and they were writing this big story, like, 'Where does PUBG start? Where does it fit in?'\". Had those plans continued, the horror game would have sat \"pretty far out\" along the timeline, but somewhere during development the idea was dropped.\r\n \nRead more",

It also ushers in the highly anticipated Deep Dark biome, which was originally due to launch as part of the Caves & Cliffs update before getting delayed.\r\n\n\r\nThe Deep Dark biome, as its name very much implies, is Minecraft's deepest area to date, and is found beneath the game's current bedrock layer. Here, curious adventures will uncover remnants of a ruined civilisation as well as creepy, eyeless mobs known as Wardens. These fearsome foes react to vibrations, meaning stealth is the key to survival, and can also be summoned if careless explorers stumble into the new Shrieker traps.\r\n \nRead more",

At the same time, a smaller team was working on its next-gen release, promised long before the project's launch woes, and an even smaller group was doing preliminary work on its paid expansion.\r\n\n\r\nInevitably, those numbers have shifted considerably over time - less than half of CD Projekt's development staff were working on Cyberpunk's base game and next-gen update by June last year, for instance - and that trend has, unsurprisingly, continued. As per today's financial results, Cyberpunk 2077 support has \"shrunk considerably\" following the release of its next-gen update (which CD Projekt says had \"a positive effect on the game's perception and sales figures\"), with the \"bulk of [the studio's] development capacity\" now working on its expansion.\r\n \nRead more",

And today's addition, titled Leviathan, is a very different proposition to April's The Blighted, and sounds considerably more ambitious - and significantly weirder - than any of the expeditions we've seen before. \nThat said, Leviathan begins in much the same way as previous expeditions, dropping all players into one location. However, what follows is something closer to a roguelike experience, stripping explorers of their progress whenever they die. The narrative twist, though, is that players are actually stuck in a mysterious time loop, and the entire community will need to work together to find a way to break free.\n Read more",

Six years on, it's a substantially different beast, with Paradox having made some sweeping changes along the way, most notably in its radical 2.0 release.\nThe many faceted road to galactic supremacy it present is still a tonne of strategic fun though, even if - as is generally the way with Paradox titles - the purity of the base game has now been somewhat muddied by an increasingly unwieldy stack of post-launch DLC.\n Read more",

The big gambit this year, if you're unaware, is an ongoing, season-spanning narrative that will progress across monthly in-game story episodes known as Adventures.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a promising idea that so far doesn't really seem to have found its footing, with Seas of Thieves' initial set of Adventures having felt decidedly undercooked, both in terms of their challenges and narrative presentation. But with three Adventures now under its belt, Rare is ready to launch the other major component of 2022's ambitious narrative plans: Mysteries.\r\n \nRead more",

Alongside others who had worked with him to launch Hearthstone, Brode went on to found his own studio, Second Dinner, which has been working on Marvel Snap ever since with Chinese outfit Nuverse, the gaming arm of TikTok owner Bytedance.\r\n\n\r\nSnap's focus is on short, unique matches which \"cut out the fluff\" and last around three minutes total. Player decks are smaller - 15 cards or fewer - and both players act simultaneously, rather than waiting for the other person to finish.\r\n \nRead more",

What is its full game list? How good will its streaming be? And how soon should we expect newer games like Ratchet & Clank and Horizon Forbidden West to turn up on the service? \nThe biggest difference between PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass is, of course, the lack of big new first-party games launching into Plus on day one. But, with Starfield's delay to 2023, Microsoft might not have any on Game Pass this year either. How will Xbox counter?

          "description": "Max Hoberman, CEO of Halo co-developer Certain Affinity, has shared a message with staff regarding recent political events, namely those involving personal health and privacy matters and the recent draft from the US Supreme Court to potentially overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\"As a business leader it's exceptionally difficult to navigate highly politicised issues like transgender and abortion rights. But I'm not content to sit back and say or do nothing,\" he tweeted, before sharing an in-depth message he had sent out to his employees.\nThis message reads: \"It is appalling that states, including the [Certain Affinity] headquarters' home state of Texas, are wading into what I consider personal health and privacy matters. Recently this encompassed gross intrusions on the rights and dignity of transgender youth, putting politics over the physical and emotional health and wellbeing of a vulnerable population, and threatening their families, friends, doctors and other supporters.\n Read more",

Time will tell, but Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was pretty impressed when he played an early version shortly after its E3 2019 unveiling, calling it \"honestly one of the demos I found hardest to tear myself away from.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Or next year - publisher Nacon's press release and YouTube description currently disagree, which I'm trying to get to the bottom of.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the original GreedFall launched in 2019, its combination of RPG action and BioWare-style player choice struck a bit of a chord despite its unavoidable rough edges, quickly raising its profile through plenty of positive word of mouth - ultimately, to the tune of over 2m sales - as players got stuck into its ambitious historical fantasy yarn.\r\n\n\r\n\"GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults,\" said Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfield in her review at the time, \"and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Originally, this target of carbon neutrality was set for 2050. However, today the company released a statement revealing a new target year of 2040.\n\"Sony will accelerate its target year for carbon neutrality, that is, greenhouse gas emissions of virtually zero, from 2050 to 2040. Specifically, Sony intends to make direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) of its own operations carbon neutral by 2030, and by 2040, in addition to scopes 1 and 2, Sony will also target other emissions originating from stages such as products, supply chains, and logistics (scope 3), aiming for net zero emissions achieved in all scopes.\"\n Read more",

          "description": "Last week, I got to have a closer look at the Saints Row reboot from Volition. As you would expect, it looked bombastic and eclectic, with a myriad of unusual ideas that can only really be married together in a Saints Row game.\nHowever, at this point, it also felt like Volition has focused a bit too much on adding in all this \"stuff\" to the game, and seemingly at the cost of some polish and finesse. Saints Row was confirmed to be a cross-gen release on its initial announcement last year, and that seems to be a fair market for it. Right now, it just looks and feels like more of a last-gen game than a current one.\nThroughout the showcase, Saints Row's fighting appeared to be a touch clunky, while its cutscenes and dialogue felt more forced than we may expect from a game today. Meanwhile, during a close up of the Boss' face, you could clearly see that the character's eyelashes and eyelids did not match up in the way you would expect them to. This could be a bug that will be fixed by launch, but it was nonetheless jarring on the eye (mine, not the Boss', although their eye did look jarred as well).\n Read more",

We covered a broad range of topics, including plenty on what's new for this entry, but we started by discussing why Saints Row aficionados should come back to the series, despite its brand-new cast and setting. \r\n\n\r\n\"It definitely still feels like Saints Row - even if it's not the same characters, even if it's not the same setting, even if it's not exactly the same as before - it feels like Saints Row,\" Lindgren said.\r\n\n\r\n\"I feel that every single time I go into the game, whether that's just customisation (because customisation is a huge part of it), whether that's travelling around the city, whether that's wing suiting and doing the missions, it feels like Saints Row. And I think that's at least worth checking out if you're an older player, but also for a newer player to discover that feeling for the first time.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "From Elden Ring on Game Boy to that Advance Wars/Mass Effect mash-up, demakes are all the rage these days - and now it's classic first-person puzzler Portal's turn to get the retro port treatment, courtesy of a new fan project to rebuild it for N64.\r\n\n\r\nPortal, of course, released back in 2007 as part of Valve's legendary Orange Box collection, where it immediately wrought cake memes, Companion Cubes and iconic antagonist GLaDOS upon an unsuspecting world. It also proved to be an ingenious puzzler beneath all that - tasking players with manipulating portals to navigate increasingly devious challenges - and one that still holds up wonderfully today.\r\n\n\r\nThe currently in-development Portal demake, officially known as Portal 64, is the work of developer James Lambert, and is ambitiously attempting to pack the entire experience of Valve's classic - memes, portals, puzzles, and all - down onto Nintendo hardware that preceded its release by over a decade.\r\n \nRead more",

At the time, the developer called the move a \"direct attack on human rights\", adding that \"standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values\".\nHowever, in light of reports that Sony is refusing to authorise any public statements its PlayStation studios might want to make around the issue of reproductive rights, some Bungie fans have questioned whether the developer will still be able to express its opinion so freely once its acquisition by Sony is complete.\n Read more",

Described as the \"first milestone on the long road to Arma 4\", Reforger launches into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access today.\r\n\n\r\nBohemia opened a lengthy livestream earlier today with confirmation that the long-awaited Arma 4 is in development (its predecessor, Arma 3, celebrates its 10th birthday next year), but the remainder of the stream's focus was very much on Reforger. It's being called a new standalone \"platform\" for the series, consisting of several key parts; there's a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.\r\n\n\r\nReforger's sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia's previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer's latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Game grading company Wata Games is the target of a new US class action lawsuit accusing it of unfair business practices and of manipulating the retro gaming market for its own gain.\r\n\n\r\nAs reported by VGC, the lawsuit was filed on 10th May in the Central District of California, representing class members (estimated to be as many as 10,000 individuals) who all paid for game grading and other services by Wata. It accuses Wata of \"engaging in affirmative acts to manipulate the retro video game market\" and of \"engaging in unfair business practices\", specifically pointing the figure at Wata president and CEO Deniz Kahn.\r\n\nKahn is accused of working with auction house Heritage Auctions co-founder Jim Halperin - a previous Wata investor and advisory board member - to manipulate the retro games market through promotional efforts and media interviews, in which the pair are said to have claimed that retro games prices would continue to rise.\r\n \nRead more",

It debuts the In Plain Site mission, in which the Stargate team, including sniper Max Bolton and technical officer Sam Watson, attempt to put down a sacrifice ritual inside the Jaffa village by disguising themselves as the enemy.\r\n\n\r\nThe stealth heavy Stargate: Timekeepers, developed by Creative Forge Games (Hard West, Phantom Doctrine), looks heavily inspired by the Commandos series (this is not a guns blazing type of game). The campaign departs from the end of season seven of the Stargate SG-1 main plot with an original story starting during the Battle of Antarctica. It unfolds over 14 missions, each of which lasts around an hour, and revolves around unravelling a timeloop mystery and defeating the Goa'uld threat.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Way back in 2018, developer Remedy Entertainment announced it was working to adapt its beloved supernatural horror adventure Alan Wake for television - and now, some four years later, it finally has an update on the project, announcing it's partnering with The Walking Dead network AMC to bring the show to life.\r\n\n\r\nAlan Wake, for the uninitiated, debuted on Xbox 360 back in 2010, and its small-town horror, in which the titular novelist battles supernatural forces armed with little more than a flashlight and an endless urge to monologue, quickly gained cult classic status. But while all was quiet on the Alan front for over a decade, he's had something of a resurgence in recent times.\r\n\n\r\nAlongside a prominent role in Remedy's acclaimed Control - specifically in its second DLC, known as AWE - Alan Wake was given the remaster treatment in 2021 (a release now confirmed for Switch) and will be getting a long-awaited sequel some time next year. As such, a TV series expanding Alan's reach still further seems like the next logical step for Remedy.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you've been pining for the return of Ubisoft's impressively enduring Rabbids ahead of their flagship appearance in this year's Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope on Switch, you're in luck: Ubisoft has announced it'll be giving its previously China-exclusive game Rabbids: Adventure Party a global release at some point before the end of next month.\r\n\n\r\nRabbids: Adventure Party initially launched for Switch in 2020, sending the titular nuisances back in time for some hijinks inspired by classic Chinese novel Journey to the West - and for some minigame action played using the Switch's Joy-Con controllers.\r\n\n\r\nThere'll be a number of notable changes for Rabbids: Adventure Party come its global release, however. For starters, according to Ubisoft's latest earnings report, it'll be getting a new name, becoming the slightly less catchy Rabbids: Party of Legends, and will be branching out onto other platforms in addition to Switch - namely Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Stadia.\r\n \nRead more",

Of course, players still step into the shoes of engineer Isaac Clarke as they take their terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura - battling the nightmarish necromorphs along the way - but EA Motive's version promises to bring enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks include improved story, characters, and game mechanics.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing the remake's official unveiling, EA Motive has given Dead Space fans a surprisingly thorough behind-the-scenes look at its development, revealing more on its gameplay changes, audio, and art across three separate livestreams.\r\n \nRead more",

The breakup of FIFA and EA has sparked numerous headlines this week, as both sides have claimed the deal is good for them.\r\n\nOn EA's part, it has said freedom from the FIFA organisation will allow it to do far more with its football game.  (It will also, of course, save the hefty sum it paid for those four letters on the front of its box.) As for FIFA, it has said its brand is the thing that matters, and it'll be fine without EA. Indeed, to quote FIFA president Gianni Infantino, \"the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST\". So there's that.\nBut behind all the bluster, what do we think EA Sports FC will really look like in future? And does FIFA stand any chance of coming up with a rival game developed in time for next year? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan, plus resident footy fan Wesley Yin-Poole.\r\n \nRead more",

However, that lady is a hardy one, and if anything, she only looks mildly disgruntled as the bomb blasts go off around her (which, you know, seems fair).\nAnother amusing discovery comes from the snowy streets of Jackson. This time, it is Ellie in the control seat, and she is pissed at the community's annoying kids for trying to best her in a snowball fight.

Essentially, the more players bother specific bug types in their quest for new materials - whether that be by killing them outright or merely invading their territory - the more likely those creatures will be to storm player bases to try and exact revenge.\r\n\n\r\nWhile that'll happen automatically during play, those looking for a more on-demand-style experience can take advantage of two additional features. There's the new Waft Emitter device that enables players to summon specific bug types to a location for some wave-based mayhem by jamming in parts stolen from their downed brethren. The more parts used, the more intense the ensuing battle will be so players are recommended to proceed cautiously.\r\n \nRead more",

As well as this hulking brute, there will also be four new mini bosses for players to square up against, or Lewis' \"True sons\" as Ubisoft calls them. \nThis update will also introduce a new eight-player co-op mode called Countdown. As the name suggests, here players making up two teams will be given a 15-minute countdown to stabilize a power plant before it's locked down for good. The teams will be starting in different locations on the map and must work together to be victorious on their mission (so, you know, no pressure).

Almost two years went by with ne'er a peep on the project, but then October 2018 finally brought a more extensive reveal. Unexpectedly, though, just a month later, CCP announced its intention to \"return to the drawing board\" with Project Nova, and 18 months after that, the game was officially no more.\r\n\n\r\nDespite that rollercoaster ride, CCP said it remained committed to releasing an EVE Online FPS and that work on a new sci-fi shooter, with expanded scope, would continue at its London studio.

The project is said to be a prequel to the Mafia trilogy - which would suggest a return to the prohibition era action of the very first Mafia game, if not even earlier.\nAdditionally, Hangar 13 will reportedly be ditching its Mafia 3 engine - used in the recent Mafia 1 remake - in favour of Unreal Engine 5.

BB-8 is represented by an orange and grey Xbox Series S, for instance, while Boba Fett opts for orange and green, and Darth Vadar goes all-in on the black.\r\n\n\r\nThe full list of characters emblazoned on the custom consoles is as follows: BB-8, Boba Fett, Chewbacca, Darth Maul, Darth Vader, Finn, Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, Rey, Stormtrooper, and Yoda. Additionally, all 12 custom consoles feature controller designs that match their chosen character-themed colour schemes.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A new lawsuit filed by New York City Employees' Retirement System has alleged Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick fast-tracked a takeover bid from Microsoft in order to escape liability for wrongdoing following a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming he'd known about sexual misconduct at the Call of Duty publisher \"for years\".\r\n\n\r\nActivision Blizzard has faced a relentless stream of shocking allegations relating to its workplace culture since last July, when a State of California lawsuit filing called the publisher \"a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women\". Building on that lawsuit, the Wall Street Journal published a report in November claiming Bobby Kotick had been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company \"for years\", but had failed to act on them or tell the board of directors and executives everything he knew.\r\n\n\r\nIt's these claims relating to Kotick's behaviour that form the backbone of a new lawsuit filed by the New York City Employees' Retirement System and pension funds, which owns Activision shares. The filing (as spotted by Axios) aims to secure documentation Activision has reportedly so far refused to release so that the plaintiff can carry out an investigation into the board’s \"failure to maintain a safe and non- discriminatory working environment for its (specifically minority and female) employees, and failure to take action in response to repeated, grave allegations of misconduct, discrimination, and harassment by Activision’s senior executives.\"\r\n \nRead more",

EA is gathering all three together under the banner Seize the Night, and all are connected by a loose nocturnal theme.\r\n\n\r\nAt the smaller end of the scale are two new Kit packs, currently being teased under the names Chic Nights Out and Cozy Nights In, which perhaps points to a new selection of nightlife clothing in the first expansion and comfy new furnishings in the latter.\r\n \nRead more",

This basically means that Genshin Impact makes roughly $1bn every six months. \nThese impressive figures come from Sensor Tower, with the company saying: \"Following its worldwide release, the title took 171 days to generate its first $1bn on mobile, not including spending through third-party Android stores. \n\"It then took an extra 195 days to accumulate a further $1bn - resulting in the title picking up $2bn in its first year alone. Genshin Impact crossed the $3bn milestone 185 days later, meaning the game has averaged revenue of $1bn every six months, making it one of the most successful mobile games of all time.\"\n Read more",

These all sound very nice, with balancing tweaks and economy changes across the board, but let's talk about the true star of the show - Hellraid's new (and only) firearm. Or, to give it its proper name, the Deathbringer shotgun.\nA far cry from its fellow axes and swords of old, this shotgun is obtained by completing the Loaded for the Undead bounty (thanks, RPS) and certainly packs a powerful punch. Those pesky skeletons do not stand a chance, and will soon crumble into a bony pile of, well, bones thanks to the Deathbringer.

Similarly, it also wants shareholders to vote against a proposal to put an employee representative on its board.\r\n\n\r\nAs detailed in its latest shareholder filing, Activision Blizzard's board of directors is unanimously recommending shareholders vote against enacting the annual report, which would include several proposed metrics: the total number of pending sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or ligation; details of the company's progress toward reducing the average time it takes to resolve sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints; the amount of money it has spent settling disputes related to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, and finally pay and hours worked consolidated data.\r\n\n\r\nWhile this kind of proposed transparency might seem prudent given that Activision Blizzard has been rocked by shocking allegations around its workplace practices since last July, and remains embroiled in a number of lawsuits relating to those practices - including last year's State of California filing, which described the publisher as a \"breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women\" - its board says it believes the proposal isn't \"in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We've known developer Sloclap's challenging kung-fu beat-'em-up Sifu would be getting much-requested difficulty settings for some time, but now, following the release of a new content roadmap earlier this week, Sloclap has offered a closer look at how they'll function when they arrive in a new update next Tuesday, 3rd May.\r\n\n\r\nAs we learned earlier this week, Sifu's new difficulty levels will come in three flavours - Student, Disciple, and Master - and Sloclap's latest preview trailer breaks each setting down in a little more detail. Disciple, for instance, will offer the \"classic Sifu experience\", and it's the option for those that want to continue playing the game as it is now.\nStudent, however, is designed for those wanting a slightly easier ride. It'll make the experience \"more forgiving but still challenging\", by increasing player health, making ageing more forgiving, and introducing weaker enemies with less aggressive AI that use simplified combos.\r\n \nRead more",

This one, developed by Studio Fizbin (responsible for last year's striking Minute of Islands), is a follow-up to acclaimed 2013 point-and-click adventure The Inner World, and once again follows young, flute-nosed adventurer Robert on a quest to save the world. \r\n \nRead more",

If your interest is suitably piqued, proceedings kick off at 3pm in the UK/7am PDT on 10th May via Twitch, and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak’s director, Yoshitake Suzuki, will be on presenting duties.\r\n\n\r\nCapcom’s previous Sunbreak digital event was a biggie, giving us a release date, a look at some new monsters, as well as an introduction to the expansion’s new hub area - the bustling port town of Elgado Outpost - and its new map, The Citadel. The latter promises to deliver a diverse range of biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece - and we got an extended tour in a subsequent video.\r\n \nRead more",

As such, those looking to seek further legal actions will now potentially be entitled to \"further compensations, equivalent to a minimum of six months of salary\".\nBut while this is certainly still a victory in itself, it does not mean former Blizzard Versailles employees will find their positions reinstated in a different studio. \n Read more",
