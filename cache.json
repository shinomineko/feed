You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don&#8217;t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>\n<p>This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE&#8217;s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government&#8217;s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has &#8212; without any judicial, legislative or public oversight &#8212; reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver&#8217;s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>",

The server keeps track of every time this &#8220;image&#8221; is opened and by which IP address. This quirk of internet history means that marketers can track exactly when you open an email and your IP address, which can be used to roughly work out your location.</p>\n<p>So, how does Apple Mail stop this? By caching. Apple Mail downloads all images for all emails before you open them. Practically speaking, that means every message downloaded to Apple Mail is marked &#8220;read,&#8221; regardless of whether you open it.

And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>",

However, context is important for fully understanding something, be it socially or in software development, and this deserves a more in-depth review. Alongside the dockershim removal in Kubernetes v1.24, we’ve seen some confusion (sometimes at a panic level) and dissatisfaction with this decision in the community, largely due to a lack of context around this removal. The decision to deprecate and eventually remove dockershim from Kubernetes was not made quickly or lightly. Still, it’s been in the works for so long that many of today’s users are newer than that decision, and certainly newer than the choices that led to the dockershim being necessary in the first place.\nSo wh…",

Six years on, it's a substantially different beast, with Paradox having made some sweeping changes along the way, most notably in its radical 2.0 release.\nThe many faceted road to galactic supremacy it present is still a tonne of strategic fun though, even if - as is generally the way with Paradox titles - the purity of the base game has now been somewhat muddied by an increasingly unwieldy stack of post-launch DLC.\n Read more",

The big gambit this year, if you're unaware, is an ongoing, season-spanning narrative that will progress across monthly in-game story episodes known as Adventures.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a promising idea that so far doesn't really seem to have found its footing, with Seas of Thieves' initial set of Adventures having felt decidedly undercooked, both in terms of their challenges and narrative presentation.

And how soon should we expect newer games like Ratchet & Clank and Horizon Forbidden West to turn up on the service? \nThe biggest difference between PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass is, of course, the lack of big new first-party games launching into Plus on day one. But, with Starfield's delay to 2023, Microsoft might not have any on Game Pass this year either. How will Xbox counter?

Further evidence of the project's existence emerged earlier this year, when a member of Naughty Dog's QA team listed an \"unannounced remake\" on their resumé - a reference since removed.\r\n\n\r\nYet while there's still no official word on a Last of Us remake, rumours of the project continue to swirl, with ever-leaky GamesBeat reporter Jeff Grubb now claiming it's set for a 2022 release.\r\n \nRead more",

That may no longer be the case, however.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to Thunderful's latest earnings report (thanks IGN), Headhunter, which is now scheduled for a 2023 release, won't be the only SteamWorld title coming that year.

          "description": "Last week, I got to have a closer look at the Saints Row reboot from Volition. As you would expect, it looked bombastic and eclectic, with a myriad of unusual ideas that can only really be married together in a Saints Row game.\nHowever, at this point, it also felt like Volition has focused a bit too much on adding in all this \"stuff\" to the game, and seemingly at the cost of some polish and finesse. Saints Row was confirmed to be a cross-gen release on its initial announcement last year, and that seems to be a fair market for it. Right now, it just looks and feels like more of a last-gen game than a current one.\nThroughout the showcase, Saints Row's fighting appeared to be a touch clunky, while its cutscenes and dialogue felt more forced than we may expect from a game today. Meanwhile, during a close up of the Boss' face, you could clearly see that the character's eyelashes and eyelids did not match up in the way you would expect them to. This could be a bug that will be fixed by launch, but it was nonetheless jarring on the eye (mine, not the Boss', although their eye did look jarred as well).\n Read more",

It also proved to be an ingenious puzzler beneath all that - tasking players with manipulating portals to navigate increasingly devious challenges - and one that still holds up wonderfully today.\r\n\n\r\nThe currently in-development Portal demake, officially known as Portal 64, is the work of developer James Lambert, and is ambitiously attempting to pack the entire experience of Valve's classic - memes, portals, puzzles, and all - down onto Nintendo hardware that preceded its release by over a decade.\r\n \nRead more",

At the time, the developer called the move a \"direct attack on human rights\", adding that \"standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values\".\nHowever, in light of reports that Sony is refusing to authorise any public statements its PlayStation studios might want to make around the issue of reproductive rights, some Bungie fans have questioned whether the developer will still be able to express its opinion so freely once its acquisition by Sony is complete.\n Read more",

Described as the \"first milestone on the long road to Arma 4\", Reforger launches into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access today.\r\n\n\r\nBohemia opened a lengthy livestream earlier today with confirmation that the long-awaited Arma 4 is in development (its predecessor, Arma 3, celebrates its 10th birthday next year), but the remainder of the stream's focus was very much on Reforger. It's being called a new standalone \"platform\" for the series, consisting of several key parts; there's a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.\r\n\n\r\nReforger's sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia's previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer's latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.\r\n \nRead more",

The first phase of this rework arrived last July, making significant changes to California's northern road network, adding (and in a few cases, removing) scenery towns, and introducing Border Protection Stations.\r\n \nRead more",

Which, to be honest, should be more than enough to keep you amused if this is your first time in Redout's world.\r\n \nRead more",

The campaign departs from the end of season seven of the Stargate SG-1 main plot with an original story starting during the Battle of Antarctica. It unfolds over 14 missions, each of which lasts around an hour, and revolves around unravelling a timeloop mystery and defeating the Goa'uld threat.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Way back in 2018, developer Remedy Entertainment announced it was working to adapt its beloved supernatural horror adventure Alan Wake for television - and now, some four years later, it finally has an update on the project, announcing it's partnering with The Walking Dead network AMC to bring the show to life.\r\n\n\r\nAlan Wake, for the uninitiated, debuted on Xbox 360 back in 2010, and its small-town horror, in which the titular novelist battles supernatural forces armed with little more than a flashlight and an endless urge to monologue, quickly gained cult classic status. But while all was quiet on the Alan front for over a decade, he's had something of a resurgence in recent times.\r\n\n\r\nAlongside a prominent role in Remedy's acclaimed Control - specifically in its second DLC, known as AWE - Alan Wake was given the remaster treatment in 2021 (a release now confirmed for Switch) and will be getting a long-awaited sequel some time next year. As such, a TV series expanding Alan's reach still further seems like the next logical step for Remedy.\r\n \nRead more",

For starters, according to Ubisoft's latest earnings report, it'll be getting a new name, becoming the slightly less catchy Rabbids: Party of Legends, and will be branching out onto other platforms in addition to Switch - namely Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Stadia.\r\n \nRead more",

The breakup of FIFA and EA has sparked numerous headlines this week, as both sides have claimed the deal is good for them.\r\n\nOn EA's part, it has said freedom from the FIFA organisation will allow it to do far more with its football game.  (It will also, of course, save the hefty sum it paid for those four letters on the front of its box.) As for FIFA, it has said its brand is the thing that matters, and it'll be fine without EA. Indeed, to quote FIFA president Gianni Infantino, \"the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST\". So there's that.\nBut behind all the bluster, what do we think EA Sports FC will really look like in future? And does FIFA stand any chance of coming up with a rival game developed in time for next year?

          "description": "Mini Motorways, the acclaimed road-building strategy sim from developer Dinosaur Polo Club, has made the leap to Switch and will be available via the console's eShop from today, 11th May.\r\n\n\r\nAs you might have already twigged, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club's celebrated underground railway builder Mini Metro, and delivers an equally minimalist, equally excellent, spin on its predecessor's tactile strategy action.\r\n\n\r\nIn Mini Motorways, each level takes loose inspiration from a real-world city, and the goal is to construct as efficient a road network as possible, placing down the likes of traffic lights, bridges, and roads to ensure commuters are able to reach their destination within the allotted time. New building items are awarded each in-game week, enabling your urban expansion to continue unfettered - until you make a mistake and your best laid plans end in chaos.\r\n \nRead more",

Essentially, the more players bother specific bug types in their quest for new materials - whether that be by killing them outright or merely invading their territory - the more likely those creatures will be to storm player bases to try and exact revenge.\r\n\n\r\nWhile that'll happen automatically during play, those looking for a more on-demand-style experience can take advantage of two additional features. There's the new Waft Emitter device that enables players to summon specific bug types to a location for some wave-based mayhem by jamming in parts stolen from their downed brethren. The more parts used, the more intense the ensuing battle will be so players are recommended to proceed cautiously.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Despite having already cancelled one attempt at turning EVE Online into an FPS, developer CCP's enthusiasm for the project apparently remains strong: it's now confirmed that, two years after Project Nova officially got the chop, work on a new FPS continues at its London Studio.\r\n\n\r\nEVE Online FPS Project Nova was initially unveiled in 2016 as a spiritual successor to CCP's long-defunct free-to-play PS3 shooter Dust 514. Almost two years went by with ne'er a peep on the project, but then October 2018 finally brought a more extensive reveal. Unexpectedly, though, just a month later, CCP announced its intention to \"return to the drawing board\" with Project Nova, and 18 months after that, the game was officially no more.\r\n\n\r\nDespite that rollercoaster ride, CCP said it remained committed to releasing an EVE Online FPS and that work on a new sci-fi shooter, with expanded scope, would continue at its London studio. That was more than two years ago, though, leading many to assume that the project had also run its a course.\r\n \nRead more",

Undeterred though, Yoshida was willing to speak a little further on Final Fantasy 16's progress, saying the game is \"greatly coming together\" but that he wants the development team to spend more time on polishing the experience.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Fans of quality freebies (so basically everyone then, I assume) are in for a treat next week as Prey and Jotunn join the lengthening list of games to be given away on the Epic Store.\r\n\n\r\nPrey, of course, is yet another winner from Arkane Studios, the developer behind the critically acclaimed likes of Dishonored and Deathloop. As with those series, Prey, which released back in 2017, falls squarely in the immersive sim genre, this time taking the studios' focus on open-ended traversal and player choice into outer space.\r\n\n\r\nHere, players take on the role of Morgan Yu and, after a memorably orchestrated opening sequence, find themselves onboard the space station Talos I somewhere in the year 2032. It's a gorgeously luxuriant setting - Eurogamer called it \"perhaps the grandest and most beautiful facility of its kind ever imagined for a game\" in its Recommended review - but all is not right.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Following the news that Haden Blackman, studio head and founder of Mafia 3's developer Hangar 13, is stepping down from the role after seven years, a new report has claimed a fourth instalment in the Mafia series is currently in early development at the studio.\nThat's according to Kotaku, which reports that newly appointed studio boss Nick Baynes is leading development on a brand-new Mafia game, codenamed Nero. The project is said to be a prequel to the Mafia trilogy - which would suggest a return to the prohibition era action of the very first Mafia game, if not even earlier.\nAdditionally, Hangar 13 will reportedly be ditching its Mafia 3 engine - used in the recent Mafia 1 remake - in favour of Unreal Engine 5. It may, however, be some time before either the studio or publisher 2K Games is ready to talk about the title, given it's still \"early in development\".\n Read more",

However, despite what was first assumed (by me at least), this is not the end of Techland's plans for its Zombie platformer. Rather, the company has announced a brand new Dieselpunk DLC, which is available from today (5th May).\n\"Go Back in Time with the New Dieselpunk DLC, discover historical Volkan Machines equipment crafted for world-class soldiers, and enjoy their unique design in Harran,\" the developer teased. This DLC comes with new gear, most notably a chainsaw known as the 'Gut Render' and a serrated sword known as the 'Flesh Ripper'. With these two weapons in your armoury, you will soon be slicing and dicing your way through those zombie hoards in a breeze.\nIf you prefer to be less up close and personal with your prey, perhaps the 'Greaser' firearm will be more your thing. In the words of Techland, this gun is the \"new definition of swiss cheese\". Of course, you could always just barrel through the advancing enemies with your new wheels, aka the 'Rugged Roadster'. Check out the blood-soaked trailer for this new DLC below.\n Read more",

          "description": "A new lawsuit filed by New York City Employees' Retirement System has alleged Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick fast-tracked a takeover bid from Microsoft in order to escape liability for wrongdoing following a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming he'd known about sexual misconduct at the Call of Duty publisher \"for years\".\r\n\n\r\nActivision Blizzard has faced a relentless stream of shocking allegations relating to its workplace culture since last July, when a State of California lawsuit filing called the publisher \"a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women\". Building on that lawsuit, the Wall Street Journal published a report in November claiming Bobby Kotick had been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company \"for years\", but had failed to act on them or tell the board of directors and executives everything he knew.\r\n\n\r\nIt's these claims relating to Kotick's behaviour that form the backbone of a new lawsuit filed by the New York City Employees' Retirement System and pension funds, which owns Activision shares. The filing (as spotted by Axios) aims to secure documentation Activision has reportedly so far refused to release so that the plaintiff can carry out an investigation into the board’s \"failure to maintain a safe and non- discriminatory working environment for its (specifically minority and female) employees, and failure to take action in response to repeated, grave allegations of misconduct, discrimination, and harassment by Activision’s senior executives.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We all love Mario Kart; it is a classic that has evolved and grown up with us and will surely continue to dominate various sales charts for many years to come. However, what if someone took this tied and tested formula, but then added in some of the classic 20th Television characters in place of Mario and co.? Well, we now have the answer. You would get Warped Kart Racers, Apple Arcade's upcoming karting game.\nIn Warped Kart Racers, players will be able to control one of 20 characters, including Hank from King of the Hill, Stan from American Dad! and Stewie from Family Guy to name but a few. In addition to these familiar faces, players will also recognise some familiar locales, as the maps that we could all soon be charging round are inspired by locations from \"fan-favourite episodes\".\nKeen karters will be able to take to the tracks in either Warped Kart Racers' single player campaign or take part in a chaotic 8-player multiplayer mode. In addition to this, you will also be able to take on daily challenges to unlock new characters, skins, karts and other customisation options. You can check out the trailer for Warped Kart Racers below.\n Read more",

Similarly, it also wants shareholders to vote against a proposal to put an employee representative on its board.\r\n\n\r\nAs detailed in its latest shareholder filing, Activision Blizzard's board of directors is unanimously recommending shareholders vote against enacting the annual report, which would include several proposed metrics: the total number of pending sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or ligation; details of the company's progress toward reducing the average time it takes to resolve sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints; the amount of money it has spent settling disputes related to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, and finally pay and hours worked consolidated data.\r\n\n\r\nWhile this kind of proposed transparency might seem prudent given that Activision Blizzard has been rocked by shocking allegations around its workplace practices since last July, and remains embroiled in a number of lawsuits relating to those practices - including last year's State of California filing, which described the publisher as a \"breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women\" - its board says it believes the proposal isn't \"in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Disciple, for instance, will offer the \"classic Sifu experience\", and it's the option for those that want to continue playing the game as it is now.\nStudent, however, is designed for those wanting a slightly easier ride. It'll make the experience \"more forgiving but still challenging\", by increasing player health, making ageing more forgiving, and introducing weaker enemies with less aggressive AI that use simplified combos.\r\n \nRead more",

The latter promises to deliver a diverse range of biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece - and we got an extended tour in a subsequent video.\r\n \nRead more",

But while Sony's lips remain officially sealed, it appears the first batch of retro games coming to the top-end Premium tier have begun leaking onto PSN.\r\n\n\r\nPlayStation Plus' new Premium tier gives subscribers access to around 340 additional games beyond the library of 400 PS4 and PS5 titles included in the mid-range Extra tier, focusing on retro games from PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3, and PSP. Sony is yet to offer specifics on either library, but users on Reddit have spotted that new listings for classic titles, complete with new thumbnail art, are starting to appear in the PSN backend, pointing to the beginnings of a roll-out for PlayStation Plus' retro games.\r\n\n\r\nGranted, there are only three such titles to be found at present, all from publisher Bandai Namco - Tekken 2 and Mr. Driller for PlayStation 1, and Ridge Racer for PSP - but it does suggests the floodgates are slowly starting to open as publishers move to get their classic titles in order ready for the new PlayStation Plus launch.\r\n \nRead more",

It's up to players, then, to explore and restore the kingdom (and its inhabitants' memories too), in an adventure that combines life-sim-style action with more traditional questing.\r\n\n\r\nAs Dreamlight Valley unfolds, players will be able to travel to exotic biomes beyond the village and befriend classic Disney and Pixar characters - each with their own story arcs, quests, and rewards - including the likes of Elsa and Anna in a snowy, Frozen-inspired kingdom, Ariel in a tropical corner of the world, and even the Lion King crew across a sunny savanna.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the joys of Supermassive Games' titles are their focus on player choice, and as a result, the branching narratives created on any given playthrough. However, this means that there are multiple different endings that players can achieve, and The Quarry is no exception. In fact, there are going to be an incredible 186 unique endings scripted into the game. Consider my jaw dropped.\nChatting to IGN, The Quarry director Will Byles broke down how exactly one goes about making a game with so many variables, and the impressive work from the actors.\n\"We write it like a movie screenplay... actors are used to a 100-page script [on a feature film], the script for this is over 1000 pages. [The actors] can get very alarmed,\" Byles revealed.\n Read more",

          "description": "After a controversial launch and a series of updates focussed on course correction, Gran Turismo 7 got its first proper content drop today, bringing three new cars and a sort of new track into the mix, as well as a suite of fixes and new features. \r\n\n\r\nLet's get the disappointing bit out the way first - the new track on offer is the 24-hour layout of the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium, which makes bold and daring changes to the layout you'll likely know well by…. Changing the position of the start/finish straight. So it's the same track you know and love, with Eau Rouge serving as the first corner rather than La Source, but this new configuration inspired by the round-the-clock race does at least suggest extended support of Gran Turismo 7's time-of-day feature. \r\n\n\r\nIn terms of new cars, leading the charge is the Subaru BRZ GT300 which was seen challenging and indeed conquering last year's Super GT series, and it's joined by its road legal offspring the freshly tweaked Subaru BRZ S. For lovers of kei cars there's a neat surprise in the diminutive form of the Suzuki Cappucino EA11R from 1991 (you'll find it on sale in the used car dealership). \r\n \nRead more",
