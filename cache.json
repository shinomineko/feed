My remit to the participants was this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The idea is to start from scratch, to pretend we’re forming a new country and don’t have any precedent to deal with. And that we don’t have any unique interests to perturb our thinking. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government mid-eighteenth century politicians technology could invent. The twenty-first century is a very different place technically, scientifically, and philosophically. What could democracy look like if it were reinvented today? Would it even be democracy­&#8212;what comes after democracy?...</p></blockquote>",

Architectural decoupling entails splitting functionality for different fundamental actions in a system, such as decoupling authentication (proving who is allowed to use the network) from connectivity (establishing session state for communicating). Institutional decoupling entails splitting what information remains between non-colluding entities, such as distinct companies or network operators, or between a user and network peers. This decoupling makes service providers individually breach-proof, as they each have little or no sensitive data that can be lost to hackers. Put simply, the Decoupling Principle suggests always separating who you are from what you do...</p></blockquote>",

Consider right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who located a hack in the tax code: &#8220;Because he was one of the founders of PayPal, he was able to use a $2,000 investment to buy 1.7 million shares of the company at $0.001 per share, turning it into $5 billion&#8212;all forever tax free.&#8221; It was perfectly legal&#8212;and even if it weren&#8217;t, the wealthy usually go unpunished. The author, a fluid writer and tech communicator, reveals how the tax code lends itself to hacking, as when tech companies like Apple and Google avoid paying billions of dollars by transferring profits out of the U.S. to corporate-friendly nations such as Ireland, then offshoring the “disappeared” dollars to Bermuda, the Caymans, and other havens. Every system contains trap doors that can be breached to advantage. For example, Schneier cites &#8220;the Pudding Guy,&#8221; who hacked an airline miles program by buying low-cost pudding cups in a promotion that, for $3,150, netted him 1.2 million miles and &#8220;lifetime Gold frequent flier status.&#8221; Since it was all within the letter if not the spirit of the offer, &#8220;the company paid up.&#8221; The companies often do, because they’re gaming systems themselves. &#8220;Any rule can be hacked,&#8221; notes the author, be it a religious dietary restriction or a legislative procedure. With technology, &#8220;we can hack more, faster, better,&#8221; requiring diligent monitoring and a demand that everyone play by rules that have been hardened against tampering...</p></blockquote>",

This could happen either in a planned way or it could happen unexpectedly.

He'd been with the company for 23 years at that point, serving as head writer and lore guru (or, more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) and had become one of its most recognisable faces across countless BlizzCons.\r\n\n\r\n\"The reason I use the word 'retire'\", Metzen explained in a statement at the time of his departure, \"is because I'm not going to some other company or starting up new projects or anything remotely like that. It's been a long, amazing stretch of years. Now it's time to slow it down. Rest. Lay around on the couch and get fat.\"\r\n \nRead more",

One day, his clothes unexpectedly fall off, a baby turns into goo, ...fish?! Then, walking!!!!\r\n\n\r\nOkay, so that's not exactly how it goes (although it's not not, either) but it's fair to say Death Stranding's atmospheric tale of a post-apocalyptic United States - which, yes, does look at awful lot like Wales - is not short of wonderfully outlandish ideas. There are eerily invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, a mysterious plane of existence known as the Beach, and much, much more.\r\n \nRead more",

Even with all these precautions in place, you may still not be safe from Valheim's new enemies. With the introduction of the Mistlands update comes a new type of raid - and this one is wreaking havoc on established player bases. Rather devastatingly, some players are losing homes that took them hundreds of hours to make. \r\n\n\r\nThe new event, called \"they sought you out\", unleashes hordes of insects on your player base - and worse still, they can fly. Seekers and seeker soldiers are capable of hopping over ditches, then mulching stone walls like they're made of papier maché. The event can occur at any time after you've defeated the Plains boss Yagluth, so anyone who has completed Valheim's biomes is vulnerable to these attacks. And sure enough, it's taking a lot of players by surprise. \r\n\n\r\n\"When we got raided we got caught off-guard and lost our three-story base which took us hundreds of hours,\" said one Reddit user. \"It was protected with walls, trenches, and most upgraded gates - it didn't slow the seekers down at all... We all rage quit after surviving the raid, but after looking around at the aftermath, we realised any amount of rebuilding wouldn't matter because we lost seasonal item buffs for comfort level and we could not survive another raid like that.\"\r\n \nRead more",

However, it has now been given a colourful little update by Activision. So, yes, we will be able to see you now. \nAs Ishraq reported earlier this month, this skin by LA Thieves was labelled  \"Roze 2.0\", which is a reference to the Roze skin that was released for the original Warzone and Modern Warfare back in 2019. This skin was notoriously famous for making its wearer hard to see. In fact, following its release, Raven Software was forced to edit the skin to make it easier for other players to see the elusive Roze skin wearers.\r\n \nRead more",

While The Game Awards 2022 dominated the news, Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover faced a major setback with the FTC and Diablo 4's big release date announcement was superseded by serious claims of mismanagement and crunch.  \r\n\nThe awards ceremony was an eventful affair, even without its climactic and rather concerning stage invasion. The typical array of trailers for games like Final Fantasy 16, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor and Street Fighter 6 came thick and fast, alongside big announcements for things such as Death Stranding 2, Hades 2, Horizon Forbidden West PS5-only DLC and Armored Core 6. \nDid Geoff Keighley keep his pledge to make this year's ceremony speedier? Not really. Somewhere, Christopher Judge is now on the second day of his acceptance speech. So, here for you today is a recap of everything we thought was really worth your time - and what we think Death Stranding 2 should actually be titled.

A lot has happened there of course - a lot of tweaking and tuning and honing the experience of the game. Its popularity allowed Larian to breathe and make BG3 a bigger, better thing.\nJust for giggles: the August 2023 date also means BG3 arrives 23 years after BG2, and 25 years after the original Baldur's Gate.

Colleagues claim, for instance, McCree \"would grow intrigued by different aspects of the game and then lose interest and hand it off to other people without finishing what he started.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Even the powers that be at Sony reportedly didn't feel the game warranted a sequel. \r\n\n\r\nBut, according to Days Gone director John Garvin, the game itself was not to blame for this tepid reception.

          "description": "Microsoft has agreed a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo if its buyout of Activision Blizzard goes through.\r\n\n\r\nXbox boss Phil Spencer tweeted the announcement, which also confirms the company's commitment to continue to release Call of Duty games on Valve's Steam platform \"simultaneously to Xbox\", if the gargantuan $69 billion offer to buy Activision Blizzard is approved. Call of Duty's latest releases, Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, are already on Steam.\r\n\n\r\nThe announcement is a direct response to the scrutiny the acquisition has come under from a raft of organisations across the world, chief among them the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK.\r\n \nRead more",

It's entirely inessential fluff, but, tucked between all that, Deep Silver does manage to squeeze in a few minutes of gameplay.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, there's little that's particularly revelatory in there - the publisher basically just used the time to reiterate the obvious fact you'll mostly be maiming various zombie types gruesomely until they're dead - but it did give us a decent new look at Dead Island 2's appealingly sun-kissed gore, as well as a taste of its weapon roster, including hammers, machetes, bear claws, a \"shit-tonne of guns\", and various makeshift tools of destruction. \r\n \nRead more",

It was originally planned for release as part of next year's Season 3, but as developer 343 Industries explains in its blog post, \"We fully agree with players who felt [it] should be a priority — it's a key support structure for what players create in Forge and a pillar for the community.\" 343 says this initial V1 release is \"likely to have some rough edges\" but will continue to evolve over time.\r\n\n\r\nElsewhere, today's update introduces Empyrean, a \"reimagining\" of Halo 3's The Pit map that's been officially rebuilt in Forge by 343. \"How do Halo Infinite's toys, like its limited-use Equipment, alter some of those dynamics and affect how you traverse the combat dance floor?,\" the developer asks in its introduction. \"Maybe the enemy team managed to grab the rockets first, but you went and acquired the Repulsor to protect yourself...

          "description": "Developer Digital Extremes has announced the long-awaited arrival of cross-play support for its free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe, meaning Tenno on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC can finally join forces wherever they may be.\r\n\n\r\nCross-play was initially announced during Digital Extremes' TennoCon fan event in July 2021, with the developer saying it hoped to launch the feature before the end of that year. It obviously missed that target and then some, but, 12 months later, cross-play is finally here.\r\n\n\r\n\"Warframe will always be a game best played and enjoyed with friends and that's why launching Cross Platform Play is such an incredible moment for us,\" Digital Extremes' chief operating officer Sheldon Carter said in a statement announcing the news. \"Together with our partners, we have broken down the walls that have prevented our players from experiencing the thrill of Warframe as one united community.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Eight months later, British developer Sumo Digital was revealed to have taken over the project, but another studio switch was still to come when Homefront: The Revolution maker Dambuster Studios took the reins in 2019.\r\n \nRead more",

Partially-redacted documentation from this process has now been made public, revealing some eyebrow-raising arguments from Sony - which is trying to block the deal. \nBoth Sony and Microsoft have gone on the defensive to make themselves look the smaller fish - with Microsoft  admitting Sony's exclusives are better and Sony saying any loss of Call of Duty would leave itself \"extremely vulnerable\", particularly if the series was made available through the popular Xbox Game Pass. So, should Sony be worried - or is this all just performative theatrics?

On the other, Kompus and Haavel have claimed the firings were due to some staff creating a \"toxic environment\" - and they were allegedly planning to depart the studio anyway to try and build a Disco Elysium sequel elsewhere.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a bit baffling that it's taken so long, and there's still a little uncertainty precisely how it'll work and how good the payouts will be, but it does at least come as part of a generous update. \r\n\n\r\nThe big addition that comes with the 1.26 patch is a track that's entirely new to Gran Turismo, and is something a bit special. Road Atlanta's a 2.5 mile circuit set in the north of the state of Georgia, and is one of the finest road courses in the USA.

(And yes, that does sound like a newly-recorded version of Maple Treeway's score.)\r\n\n\r\nAlongside yesterday's trailer I saw a generally warmer reception to the visuals in these latest additions than in some of the other DLC drops so far - which have been criticised by fans as not standing up to graphical quality seen in the base game. These DLC tracks are, by and large, taken from Mario Kart Tour - the series' smartphone spin-off - with an extra layer of polish attached. \r\n \nRead more",

Some of its most popular skins are based on football kit designs, and the game's meme-like dances were a fixture of England's 2018 World Cup squad. Last year, Epic Games officially licensed the likenesses of England's Harry Kane and Germany's Marco Reus for the delayed 2020 Euros, and featured an in-game \"UEFA Euro 2020 Cup\" tournament with cash prizes. \r\n\n\r\nPrior to that, Fortnite has added skins wearing the officially-licensed football shirts of 23 top teams worldwide, including many from the Premiership. Fortnite also has an officially licensed Neymar Jr. skin, and an emote where you can punch the air that was launched in a collaboration with Pelé.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Since its release just shy of two weeks ago, there has been a lot of chatter about God of War Ragnarök. This has ranged from whether or not there should be a PETA friendly mode included in the game, to Kratos' atonement for his past behaviour.\r\n\n\r\nOne thing that has really struck a chord is the amount of help Ragnarök's companions give when players are trying to solve puzzles. Many fans feel that, really, it would be better if said companions just held on to their advice for that little bit longer than they ultimately choose to. \r\n\n\r\nFor example, much like many others, I like to venture off the game's main path every so often to see if there are any treasures tucked away I could miss if I left the area too soon. (This is all just standard exploration, not a sign that I don't have a clue what I am doing. Honestly, it is.) Early on in the game I took one step away from Atreus and was swiftly told I was going the wrong way. \"I think this wheel over here needs to turn,\" he called after my retreating footsteps. \r\n \nRead more",

However, post-credits sequences found in that game and its Mile Morales follow-up appeared to be setting the character up as Venom in Insomniac's \"darker\" Marvel's Spider-Man 2.\r\n\n\r\nGiven that Insomniac has already teased Venom as a major antagonist in next year's sequel, it seemed a distinct possibility Porter would also be making a return, but the actor has confirmed otherwise in a now-deleted tweet.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It has, somehow, been a full year since Battlefield 2042 launched, and while it'd be premature to say DICE's shooter has bounced back from a disastrous launch it's certainly on firmer ground than it's been for a while. The belated launch of Season One in June was a small step in the right direction, while August's Season Two took bigger, bolder strides. Season Three, which kicks off on November 22nd, promises even more in the most radical season yet. \r\n\n\r\nWhat's most promising is the influx of players that should come as Battlefield 2042 hits Game Pass and EA Play, hopefully ensuring once sparse servers are fully-populated. It's part of a bigger push to get people playing Battlefield 2042, with free play periods for everyone across all platforms across December - on Xbox you can play for nada from December 1st-4th, on PC from December 1st-5th and on PlayStation from December 16th-23rd. \r\n\n\r\nSeason Three - which has been dubbed Escalation - also makes some big changes, with the most profound being a return of sorts of the traditional class system to Battlefield, with specialists now being grouped by their roles. There's a new specialist in the mix, too, with Rasheed Zain joining the fray. He's a double-amputee whose traits include a faster health recharge and an airburst launcher. \r\n \nRead more",
