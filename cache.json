As long as the speech contains the device wake word (usually &#8220;Alexa&#8221; or &#8220;Echo&#8221;) followed by a permissible command, the Echo will carry it out, researchers from Royal Holloway University in London and Italy&#8217;s University of Catania found. Even when devices require verbal confirmation before executing sensitive commands, it&#8217;s trivial to bypass the measure by adding the word &#8220;yes&#8221; about six seconds after issuing the command.

          "description": "<p>Nice piece of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08477\">research</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Among the many types of malicious codes, ransomware poses a major threat. Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker&#8217;s RSA private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware. It is expected that our method can be used to reduce the damage caused by Hive ransomware...</p></blockquote>",

If you missed that, though, the first big addition comes in the form of six Spanish-style sea forts dotted around the map. These imposing edifices, sucked into the Sea of Thieves as part of the game's new ongoing storyline, essentially function as solo-friendly, on-demand World Events, serving up a swifter, more streamlined experience compared to the likes of Skeleton Forts.\nRead more",

Valve does, however, have some hitherto unseen Portal on the way for your tearily grateful playing pleasure in the form of a free interactive tutorial thingy for Steam Deck - titled Aperture Desk Job and launching next week.\nAdmittedly, \"interactive tutorial\" sounds neither riveting nor sexy, which is probably why Valve is referring to its new Steam Deck experience as a \"free playable short\". But what actually is it?, you may be wondering. Well, in much the same way as Valve returned to the Portal universe for its entirely endearing Steam VR performance test a few years back, Aperture Desk Job is designed to walk Steam Deck owners through their new handheld's controls and features, \"while not being nearly as boring as that sounds.\"\nRead more",

Featuring both co-op play and, as of last year, a PvP versus mode, Legends was made available as a £16/$20/€20 standalone release last September, giving purchasers the option to upgrade to Ghost of Tsushima's Director's Cut at a discounted price. \nRead more",

There's Sprocket - a Mon Calamari who can control an arsenal of droids, capable of injuring opponents and protecting allies, from the comfort of his custom Command Chair - and Skora, a Rodian cartel doctor that can heal and harm with her dart gun.\nRead more",
