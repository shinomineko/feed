These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for free-form human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking. We also present a comprehensive taxonomical ontology of the types of adversarial prompts...</p></blockquote>",

On the one hand, it&#8217;s probably premature to switch to any particular post-quantum algorithms.

But if you&#8217;re going to make the switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple&#8217;s ability to do this so efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably more important than its particular cryptographic design.

As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.</p>\n<p>In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLMs...</p></blockquote>",

Oh, and that the company had widely lied to the public about its supposed big-name clients, and that its executives have been accused of hoarding the project&#8217;s token to enrich themselves.

Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a\nnode to your Pods and containers.\nBut distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,\nbecause the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can\npossibly run.

          "description": "Following the launch of Sea of Thieves' radical structural overhaul last month, Rare is readying to release a new mid-season update next week that'll add anti-cheat and subscription-free solo play to its swashbuckling pirate adventure. Plus, a big 2024 content preview is on the way as part of Sea of Thieves' sixth anniversary celebrations.\r\n\n\r\nStarting with anti-cheat, Rare has confirmed it'll be introducing Epic's kernel-level Easy Anti-Cheat solution - as used by the likes of Fortnite and Apex Legends - to Sea of Thieves next Thursday, 14th March. There's not much more to report beyond its imminent arrival, but the news'll probably bring some reassurance if you think you've been privy to suspicious behaviour out on the seas. And I'm not talking spyglass dongs.\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, next week's update brings an interesting expansion to last year's Safer Seas mode. From next Thursday onward, it'll be possible for pirates to play alone on a Safer Seas private server without needing a Game Pass Core or Game Pass Ultimate subscription. The key points to note here are that this isn't an offline mode - Sea of Thieves is still intrinsically reliant on its servers - and any form of multiplayer, even in Safer Seas, will still require Game Pass.\r\n \nRead more",

Because that's sort of what has worked with Fallout over the years. It's traded hands... it's a living thing... and we felt like we ought to take a swing at trying to build a new piece on top of all of that.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Balatro, if you're unfamiliar, challenges players to progress through a series of stage-like Blinds by exceeding each one's target score. A maximum of four poker hands can played each blind, and failure to reach the target, in classic rogue-like fashion, results in a game over.\r\n\n\r\nAs you can probably guess, though, there's a lot more to it than that, with successful Blinds rewarding in-game money to spend on the likes of fancy combo-boosting cards, exotic upgrades, and, crucially, a heap of rule-bending Jokers that quickly turn a relatively unremarkable set-up into an outlandish game of ludicrous, score-busting synergies.\r\n \nRead more",

This body-hopping adventure will be arriving in the summer of 2024. Unknown 9: Awakening has a very strong Assassin's Creed vibe, so, if you're an Assassin's fan, this might be one for you.\n Read more",

Mediterranea Inferno, last year's dazzling visual novel from The Milky Way Prince creator Lorenzo Redaelli, is out now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.\r\n\n\r\nMediterranea Inferno follows a trio of beautiful, fashionable Milan club kids in their early 20s as they reunite, after two years apart due to lingering COVID restrictions, for a three-day vacation in the blazing heat of a southern Italian summer. What follows is an artfully orchestrated descent into nightmare - a vicious, emotionally pummelling, and unabashedly queer tale of friendship and post-COVID trauma where players, in Redaelli's own words, can push \"three bourgeois twinks...towards the most horrible and gruesome endings\".\r\n\n\r\nIt's an absolute sledgehammer of a game - \"a dense, provocative, playful, exasperating, horrifying, poetic, often very funny, and occasionally even profound rumination on the sometimes paralysing search for a place in the disenfranchising shadow of modern-day life\", as I wrote in my five star review - and easily the most relentlessly stylish game of 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

And it's proven to be a particularly controversial period of downtime, not only for its length but because Warner Bros. refused to refund players for any packs, passes, premium currency bundles, or cosmetics they'd purchased across MutliVersus' nearly year-long, multi-season open beta, insisting all purchased items would be usable again once the game returned.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "This weekend, Fortnite simultaneously did something it had never done before, and something it hadn't done in ages. On the game's storied battle royale Island, players looked on as a giant hand made out of rapidly-cooling lava burst out of the ground, clasping an enormous treasure box that then lay, danging, high up in the air. \r\n\n\r\nThe hand's appearance had been much anticipated. Rhythmic rumblings had been tracked by fans to a spot outside Ruined Reels - a sort-of Greek amphitheature turned open-air cinema - and a slowly widening crack in the ground nearby. A new character, the aptly-named Odyssey, had already appeared nearby to dole out some much-needed exposition and teasing for Fortnite's incoming Ancient Greek-themed new season. And outside the game, dataminers quickly discovered what was about to happen and posted it all on social media. The stage was set. \r\n\n\r\nSo when the hand emerged, people knew what to do. That big box? It could be opened, if the chains around it were broken. And so players got to work. Some ignored Fortnite's normal battle royale rules completely, sticking instead to simply landing on the Island and shooting/pickaxing the chest's restraints, breaking them over the course of several hours, one-by-one. Others, predictably, decided to capitalise on all this by setting up camp nearby and sniping those trying to open the box. Debate raged about player etiquette - something which took me back to the outrage at people who wiped out upwards of 50-players at once as they settled in to watch Fortnite's first ever in-game event, the rocket launch, back in 2018. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Developer Crema has announced it'll be removing all monetisation from its Pokemon-like creature-battler Temtem in an update scheduled for June, with one final major patch to follow before updates refocus on bug fixing and balance changes.\r\n\n\r\nCrema shared the news in a lengthy post on Steam, which spent a lot of time addressing ongoing player complaints around a lack of major new content since launch, such as more islands, new Temtem, or additional multiplayer features. Broadly, the studio says Temtem's early access demonstrated major new content didn't have a significant impact on the game's player base, making it difficult to justify the development resources required - although other issues, such as mounting technical debt, are also cited as concerns.\r\n\n\r\nAfter a lot of words, including some regret over having described the game as an \"MMO\" in its marketing material, Crema gets to the crux of its post: that it will release two more major updates for Temtem before development switches to more modest bug fixing and balance patches, as the studio's focus turns to new projects.\r\n \nRead more",

I didn't visit it in real life for myself, but all of us have already been able to experience it vicariously through memes, quotes from frustrated parents, and interviews with the poor actors who had no idea what they were getting themselves into when they signed their contracts.\nAnd now it's in Fortnite. After trying it myself, I imagine the actual thing was pretty similar to Jonesy's Chocolate Factory Experience, a Fortnite Creative map made by player ImSachiko.

          "description": "Toys for Bob - the Activision Blizzard studio behind the likes of Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot 4, and the Spyro remasters - has announced it's parting ways with Activision to become an independent company once more. It also says it's \"exploring a possible partnership\" with Microsoft as development on its new game gets underway.\r\n\n\r\nToys for Bob, which was founded back in 1989, formed a publishing partnership with Activision in the 2000s that would lead to the studio's acquisition by the publisher in 2005. Toys for Bob has been part of Activision Blizzard ever since, initially working on the hugely popular toys-to-life Skylanders series before developing 2018 remaster Spyro Reignited Trilogy and 2020's well-received Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. Since then, it's served as a support studio for Call of Duty while also releasing last year's Crash Team Rumble.\r\n\n\r\nEarlier this month, following Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard and subsequent decision to lay off 1,900 workers across its Xbox teams, it was confirmed 86 Toys for Bob employees had lost their jobs. It was also reported the studio's physical office would be shutting down and that remaining staff would transition to working from home. And it's in this context that Toys for Bob has now announced it's splitting from Activision to go independent.\r\n \nRead more",

However, Pitchford reportedly shared an update with employees earlier this week, saying a decision had been made - and that decision, according to Kotaku's sources, was to sell.\r\n\n\r\nThe publication understands Gearbox's sale to an unnamed buyer is currently in the \"late stages of being finalised\", and while Embracer Group - which purchased Gearbox for $363m in 2021 - did not respond to Kotaku's requests for comment, Pitchford deflected the website's inquiries, saying, \"We will be thrilled to share whenever we have projects to announce or news to share as we work hard towards our mission to entertain the world.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A new documentary has shed more light on Resident Evil 4 Remake's development, and shows its director concerned the game would not be ready for its release date.\nA recent episode of 100 Cameras - a Japanese documentary series which puts 100 cameras in situ to capture the goings on in any given place - focused on Capcom. Along with a look behind the scenes of Street Fighter 6, the episode also showed a slice of Resident Evil 4 Remake's development (thanks, GamesRadar).\nAt the time of recording, there was only one month left before Resident Evil 4 Remake was set to release, but the game was reportedly riddled with a \"storm\" of issues. These included game freezes, visual glitches such as characters' hands not connecting when they are meant to be holding on to each other, and Leon getting sent to \"another dimension\" as he falls through the floor. One tester said they had found \"around 70\" new bugs in one day. Things were once so bad, Resident Evil 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Anpo admitted: \"At this rate, we won't make the release\".\n Read more",

At the time, the studio confirmed work was underway on its \"next adventure\", with the accompanying artwork pointing to a lonely adventure with sci-fi undertones.\r\n\n\r\nSince then, further bits of atmospheric concept art have sporadically surfaced - first on social media in 2018, then buried in some online job listings in 2019, then on LinkedIn last year - all seemingly pointing to an adventure in which a lone space traveller wanders a desolate planet strewn with abandoned tech. About all we've conclusively learned of the mysterious project in that time, again thanks to Playdead's jobs page, is that it's a \"third-person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe.\"\r\n \nRead more",

First, the remaster's launch was shifted from August to October - a release it eventually managed to hit on PC, albeit with the Xbox Series X/S version getting a last-minute delay to mid-November and the PS5 release arriving later still - while Ascended's various expansion remasters, originally due to launch alongside the base game, have now slipped a number of times.\r\n\n\r\nIn January, Wildcard announced its Scorched Earth expansion remaster, initially delayed to December 2023 and then moved to March 2024, would now be releasing in April, while its Aberration and Ragnarok map remasters - previously delayed to \"Q1 2024\" - were now on track to arrive in July and September 2024 respectively. Amid all this furious roadmap revision, there was a bright spot in that the enhanced version of Ark's The Center map would now be coming to Ascended a couple of months earlier than listed in December. The Center's release was later pinned down to 28th February, but once again it's all change.\r\n \nRead more",

Yet such is the popularity of the Dark Souls games - right up to the more recent Elden Ring - that they've become collectively known in the gaming community as Soulslikes. That's shorthand for games with calculating combat, high levels of challenge and repeated death, though this is of course reductive of the awe and grim majesty Miyazaki's games evoke.\r\n\n\r\nSoulslikes are everywhere now. From indie games utilising specific mechanics, to larger projects specifically trying to out-do FromSoftware at its own game. That's testament to the influence of Miyazaki's work, though he remains humble when discussing his oeuvre with me ahead of announcing the release of Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring's upcoming major expansion.\r\n\n\r\n\"We certainly didn't come up with the term Souslike and we didn't envision it as a new genre or a new term for the industry,\" he tells me. \"So of course when it first started cropping up... we were very surprised.\r\n \nRead more",

However, the broadcast was still full of annoucements for games headed to Nintendo Switch from other publishers over the coming six months. Here's a roundup of everything which appeared during the 25-minute show.\nFresh from Microsoft's confirmation it was bringing more of its Xbox console exclusives to other platforms, the show began with a look at Obsidian's Grounded - where you have to explore a massive garden as a tiny human. Grounded will support online cross-platform multiplayer on Switch when it's released on 16th April.\nAfter this, we entered the dying world of Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist. You take on the role of Lilac as she explores the landscape alongside a homunculus (Fullmetal Alchemist vibes anyone?).

It's fantastic stuff - Eurogamer's Christian Donlan called it a \"brilliant narrative adventure that is filled with intelligence and heart\" in his Recommended review back in November 2022 - and the choice-driven adventure is paired with a striking art style, inspired by the great manuscripts and the earliest printed books of the time.\r\n\n\r\nAs for Grounded, Microsoft's second Switch-bound Xbox title, it's a wonderful co-op-imbued survival and crafting adventure with a distinctly 80s twist, taking a leaf out of cinema favourite Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. As in that movie, Grounded's four protagonists are miniaturised and left to fend for themselves in a sprawling backyard garden, building bases and crafting armour to forge ahead against deadly bugs, fish, and other wildlife.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Xbox boss Phil Spencer has addressed lingering questions around the company stance on physical media following last year's leaks of an \"adorably all-digital\" Xbox Series X refresh, saying Microsoft continues to be \"supportive\" of the medium, and insisting \"getting rid of physical, that's not a strategic thing for us.\"\r\n\n\r\nAn all-digital (and distinctly cylindrical) new Xbox Series X design first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year's court battle with the FTC over its Activision Blizzard acquisition plans. However, when Spencer later acknowledged the leak, he called its contents \"old emails and documents\", insisting that \"so much has changed\".\r\n\n\r\nBut still, the possibility of an all-digital new Xbox has continued to loom, whether that be a mid-cycle refresh or a future console, particularly following news of major layoffs acoss Microsoft's games retail teams. And Spencer has now shed a little more light on Microsoft's perspective on physical media as part of an interview for journalist Stephen Totilo's Game File.\r\n \nRead more",

I have looked into this further, and it turns out not only is Trinity the name of the military order in the rebooted Tomb Raider games, but it is also the code name for the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, which was conducted by the United States Army back in 1945. And that could be what the Tomb Raider website is referring to. Whoops! \n\r\nSo, yes, the mention of Trinity on the Tomb Raider site may well be a coincidence that left the super fan in me a little too enthusiastic. Reader, I confess, I may have jumped the gun a bit here. I am going to send a message to the Tomb Raider team though and ask if they have any comment on the wording in the blog post, because my curiosity has now been piqued even more. \n\r\nThe original story continues below.\n Read more",

A lavishly designed \"saga for the ages\", is what Eurogamer called it back in 2020.\r\n\n\r\nValhalla is joined by the developer Criterion's equally recommended arcade racer Need for Speed Unbound - the \"best Need for Speed in a generation\" we said when it released in 2022 - as well as Obsidian Entertainment's slightly less gripping 2019 satirical adventure The Outer Worlds, a \"conventional, easygoing scifi RPG...that fades very quickly from the mind.\" And here's the full list of February's PlayStation Plus Extra games.\r\n \nRead more",
