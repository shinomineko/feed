Become the New McKinsey?&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you&#8217;ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans­&#8212;one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn&#8217;t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has...</p></blockquote>",

The software, used by system administrators to manage and configure networks, was communicating externally with an unfamiliar system on the internet.

          "description": "Just as it said it would, Microsoft has appealed the CMA's decision to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and its summary of arguments is now available for scrutiny.\r\n\n\r\nIn April, after months of deliberation, the UK's Competition and Market Authority made the shock decision to block Microsoft proposed $69b acquisition of the Call of Duty maker, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk \"stifling competition in this growing market\".\r\n\n\r\nIt's a position that was welcomed by some and by rejected by others. The EU, which approved the deal in May after Microsoft agreed to concessions, has been critical of the CMA's stance, and a number of UK politicians, including chancellor Jeremy Hunt, have also raised concerns. Microsoft, of course, has also criticised the decision, confirming it would launch an appeal.\r\n \nRead more",

It's widely considered to be the granddaddy of the survival horror genre, pioneering the fixed-camera spook-house formula that would go on to influence the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill.\r\n\n\r\nTHQ Nordic's reimagined version of Alone in the Dark - which is being handled by Swedish developer Pieces Interactive with Soma and Amnesia: The Dark Descent writer Mikael Hedberg at the helm - takes the basic premise of the 1992 original, in which private detective Edward Carnby helps Emily Hartwood investigate her uncle's suicide at the gloomy Derceto Mansion, and cranks up the Southern Gothic as it attempts to filter the originals' blend of exploration, combat, puzzles, and story through a more modern lens.\r\n \nRead more",

From there, things continue onward throughout the week until proceedings wind down at around 9.25am on Sunday, 4th June.\r\n\n\r\nAs ever, Summer Games Done Quick's full speedrunning schedule is an eclectic thing, covering retro classics, indie favourites, and triple-A blockbusters, with a few welcome oddities thrown in. This time around, expect to see the likes of Elden Ring and Hi-Fi Rush rubbing shoulders with Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue, Peggle Deluxe, Amnesia: Rebirth, and more.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There were plenty of announcements during Sony's Playstation Showcase last night, but the one that stood out most to me was Phantom Blade Zero. This quickfire action RPG looks brilliant and oh so slick. It blends Chinese martial arts and punk together, to create a new direction its developer has dubbed \"Kungfupunk\".\r\n\n\r\nIn Phantom Blade Zero, you take on the role of Soul. According to Soulframe Liang, founder of the game's developer S-Game, Soul is \"an elite assassin serving an elusive but powerful organisation known simply as 'The Order'.\" Soul was framed for the murder of this organisation's patriarch, and was then wounded in the \"manhunt that ensued\". Thankfully, he was saved from death by a \"mystic healer\". \r\n\n\r\nThis all sounds enticing enough already, in my opinion, but there is more. While Soul may have been saved by this healer, there is a catch - the cure only lasts for 66 days, and Soul needs to find out who framed him for killing The Order's patriarch before time runs out. Of course, this will not be an easy job, and Soul will have to fight against \"powerful foes and inhuman monstrosities\" on his journey. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Well! Bungie has finally unveiled its next project, and it's quite a surprise, whisking the developer back to its 90s roots for a revival of its classic first-person shooter series Marathon, reimagined as a PvP shooter for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Marathon released in 1994 and went on to spawn two sequels, at which point Microsoft swooped in to purchase Bungie and the Halo franchise was born. Since then, Bungie has been on a quite the journey, working its way through multiple Halo sequels and two Destiny games, the latter of which have kept the studio busy for over a decade. So it's kind of fascinating to see it cast its gaze backward for its first new project as a Sony-owned studio.\r\n\n\r\nThe new Marathon is described as a \"sci-fi PvP extraction shooter\" featuring \"evolving, persistent zones\" that, while not a direct sequel to the earlier games, is set in the same universe. \"PvP\" is the key here, too with Bungie confirming it won't have a single-player campaign. It will, however, support cross-play and cross-save between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\r\n \nRead more",

Just in time for some Hallowe'en thrills, and perhaps even some spills. \r\n\n\r\nMatthew Porretta, who also plays Control's Dr. Casper Darling, appeared on YouTube podcast Monsters, Madness, and Magic over the weekend. There, he casually revealed Alan Wake 2 is \"supposed to come out in October\".\r\n\n\r\n\"I've been working on it,\" Porretta said, when the topic turned to Remedy's nightmarish 'my manuscript has come to life and everything is trying to kill me' thriller sequel. \"That's supposed to come out in October.

          "description": "PlayStation head Jim Ryan believes Sony's current strategy of releasing games on PC several years after their console launch is working well, and fans find the extra wait for a PC port \"acceptable\".\r\n\n\r\nChatting to Famitsu (via IGN), Ryan said Sony understood \"the importance of PS5 exclusive titles\" such as last year's God of War Ragnarök, and as such dismissed the idea of launching games on PC at the same time as their console counterparts. \"PlayStation Studios' main responsibility is to make games for the latest PlayStation hardware that players will enjoy,\" Ryan explained. He went on to state the company is increasing its PS5 exclusives and \"staggering the release of the PC versions\". \r\n\n\r\nThis comment from Ryan echoes those of PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, who previously stated that the company's first-party releases will likely take \"at least a year\" to launch on PC, with the possible exception of live-service games. \r\n \nRead more",

Brawl for the Wii. In it, he lined out why he believed the series was better suited for local competition - for both philosophical and technical reasons.\r\n\n\r\nIndeed, Sakurai addressed Nintendo's often shaky online servers, saying that \"network lag tends to make the game a pretty choppy experience\". Ultimately, though, it sounds like adding online play was something he had to do: \"when it comes to technical issues, it doesn't really matter what I personally think,\" he said. \"If my job is to do it, I'll do it.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Crucially in Maquette, changes made to one environment affect the other - so if you were to, say, place a cube in a tiny courtyard in front of you, it would then materialise in the full-size courtyard you stand in, giving you a means to progress to the next area - and on it goes.\r\n \nRead more",

The 8GB card is the first to be released, with sales beginning on May 24th, while the 16GB variant debuts in July. The firm also detailed its mainstream RTX 4060 GPU, also coming in July, to debut at $299. \nAll three models ought to offer a reasonable boost in performance over their predecessors, while also adding DLSS 3 frame generation - which is perhaps more impactful on mid-range hardware than it is on the likes of the RTX 4090 which is powerful enough without it. That should allow the 4060 family to be a reasonable choice for gaming at 1080p with maxed settings (including RT / DLSS), or at 1440p with some settings reductions. \nOn average, Nvidia is claiming the 4060 Ti is 1.15x faster than the 3060 Ti and 1.6x faster than the 2060 Super (1.7x and 2.6x faster with DLSS 3). Similarly, the RTX 4060 is 1.2x faster than RTX 3060 and 1.6x faster than RTX 2060 (1.7x and 2.3x with DLSS 3). \n Read more",

At the time, Russian studio MiST Land South was attached as its developer, but after that arrangement failed to reach fruition, original publisher Strategy First went through a succession of studios with similarly unsuccessful results before the Jagged Alliance rights changed hands in 2010.\r\n\n\r\nFive years later, the rights pinballed again, this time to Nordic Games, and six years after that, THQ Nordic revealed that finally, finally, development on a third entry in the Jagged Alliance series would resume, this time under the watch of Tropico developer Haemimont Games.\r\n \nRead more",

It's set during a period when the country's football team was on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time, helping instil a sense of hope in a population still reeling from a major financial crisis. \r\n\n\r\nThat translates to \"bittersweet and sometimes dreamy\" game of kick-abouts and conversations, in which sees players - viewing the world through the eyes and ears of eight-year-old Julián - explore a dense corner of Quito, \"full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to\".\r\n \nRead more",

It offered players a vampiric spin on the well-worn battle royale formula, setting them loose across the rain-soaked, moon-drenched streets and rooftops of Prague, armed with supernatural parkour abilities and other clan-specific powers - plus, rather more boringly, guns.\r\n\n\r\nIt made for an interesting twist on a familiar genre - even if Eurogamer's Robert Purchese didn't much like the whole shooty thing when he played it back in early access - but that clearly wasn't enough to attact and retain the kind of player base Bloodhunt needed.\r\n \nRead more",

At the time, the company told investors it was \"formulating a new framework\" for the game that was better \"aligned with [its] strategy\".\r\n\n\r\nLast week, CD Projekt shared an update on Project Sirius, announcing its \"work on defining a new framework\" was now complete. But that news was followed by growing reports of layoffs at the Boston-based The Molasses Flood, which was acquired by CD Projekt in 2021, with the studio's technical narrative designer Robert Bailey, environment artist Eleanore Falck, senior environment artist and world builder Gannon Jasper, and art producer Caryn M.

It is now afternoon, and there's still no sign of it. To save myself from twiddling my thumbs while staring mindlessly at the wall, I decided to check out Flappy Souls.\r\n\nFlappy Souls is a new, free release on Steam. It is marketed as being \"a mix of Flappy Bird and Dark Souls\", hence the name. The premise is remarkably simple - you have to fly around as a baseball cap-wearing bird while dodging obstacles. Smattered through these obstacles are souls that you have to collect, and as you progress you level up. And that's it. Easy, right? No, not right. This game is HARD! \r\n\n\r\nNow, before I get too into it, let me ask - are you the kind of person who ducks a little when you go under a low bridge in a car? I am. For some reason, I have it hardwired into my brain that physically ducking will somehow ensure safer passage. Logically, of course, I know it makes absolutely no sense. If my car isn't going to fit, me ducking, or breathing in when I pass another vehicle on a slightly narrower stretch of road, isn't going to change that. And yet, I still do it. \r\n \nRead more",

Movie, Jack Black has given his likeness to a host of other video game characters, and the results are everything I could have wanted and more. \r\n\n\r\nThis eclectic menagerie of characters all come from Tenacious D's latest music video, for a song aptly named \"Video Games\". Animated versions of Black and Kyle Gass begin the promo in a fairly normal way. The duo are in a studio, with Black singing into his mic while Gass strums on his animated guitar. Soon, however, things become chaoticly brilliant.\r\n\n\r\nIt starts with Gass getting squashed by God of War's Dauði Kaupmaðr, and Black fleeing the scene only to find himself in the middle of Fallout 4 (as one does). The rest of the video then sees the duo becoming Sonic and Tails, Red Dead cowboys and more. As I have said, it is brilliant, as you can see for yourself below. \r\n \nRead more",

But he also has a revolver and cigars, so he's definitely not Mickey Mouse.\r\n\n\r\nThe gameplay we've seen so far gives me Doom vibes, whilst the vending machines remind me a lot of BioShock. I'd be lying if I said it doesn't look fun to play.\r\n \nRead more",

It should all be ok, right? Because, after all, Ramsey has a nice PSVR2 set and Gran Turismo 7, so she'll get plenty of practice.\r\n\n\r\nCut to Ramsey tearing her way round Gran Turismo 7's race tracks in her new VR wheels, with an appropriate amount of whooping and mock road rage. But alas, these new found tactics and moves do not work in the real world, and Ramsey does not pass her driving test. \"You were doing 80 in a 30,\" her driving instructor explains. It's a really fun advert, so do check it out for yourself below. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Following a fairly glitchy release - particularly on PC, with Digital Foundry going so far as to call Star Wars Jedi: Survivor \"the worst triple-A PC port of 2023 so far\" - and an initial day one update, EA is continuing its efforts to fix Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\r\n\n\r\nThis week sees the arrival of the game's fourth patch, which addresses a variety of issues, both platform specific and across all versions of the game. \r\n\n\r\nWith this patch in play, PC users can expect to see updated occlusion behaviour for raytracing, which will reduce idle time stalls. EA has also updated its PC streaming budgets, something the developer says will help alleviate traversal hitching. The team has also implemented general performance improvements for \"some VFX\" (this update will also be coming \"soon\" to console versions of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor). Lastly on the PC specific updates (for today, at least), EA has updated the data handling when toggling raytracing, improving non-raytraced performance.\r\n \nRead more",

Since then we've seen a Chinese-Room-developed successor in 2013's A Machine for Pigs, and Frictional returned to the series in 2021 with its ambitious Amnesia: Rebirth, set in the Algerian desert. \r\n\n\r\nFrictional's latest, Amnesia: The Bunker, marks a notable departure for the series, trading traditionally linear tales of horror for \"unscripted\" scares in a nightmarish semi-open-world as players - in the role of French solider Henri Clément - attempt to flee a relentless, \"adaptive\" otherworldly creature through the claustrophobic confines of the titular subterranean space.\r\n \nRead more",

It would go on to release its first game, the striking Entwined, that same year.\r\n\n\r\nWhile PixelOpus' initial outing received a mixed critical reception, its follow-up title, Concrete Genie, fared much better in 2019. It was nominated for a BAFTA Artistic Achievement award, and Eurogamer called it a \"small, perfectly formed adventure\" in our Recommended review.\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, each three-month-long Season Pass has been priced at 1,000 Silver (approximately £9/$10 USD depending on premium currency bundle), making this the first price bump since their introduction.\r\n\n\r\nBungie's newly announced 20% price increase - which won't affect the Lightfall standard edition season pass or Lightfall and Annual Pass edition - means each new Season Pass will now cost 1,200 Silver. Additionally, Destiny 2's Season Pass + 10 Ranks Bundle will cost 2,200 Silver instead of 2,000.\r\n \nRead more",

Developed by Viridis Corporation, it was published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i back in 1996. \r\n\n\r\nDespite featuring a playable Zelda (in Zelda's Adventure, it is Link who has been whisked away by Ganon), the game was pretty poorly received by, well, everyone.

The consensus is the tease relates to Kronika's Hourglass. Kronika, the antagonist of Mortal Kombat 11 and the self-styled Keeper of Time and Architect of History, used the Hourglass to alter time and space, which led to the fun interactions between young and old versions of the same character in Mortal Kombat 11.\r\n \nRead more",

After a tragedy, Ballistic retired and disappeared from public view. Until now, that is, with Ballistic back and ready to show the younger generation of Legends just how it's done.\nBallistic's abilities are well suited to both ranged and close quarters combat in any mode you choose to play. However, he truly shines at singling out a target and taking them out in a stylish manner. His passive 'The Sling' allows him to carry a third weapon but only with its base statistics. This means no attachments or upgrades, if you put a purple tier weapon in, it will instantly become its base tier. His tactical 'Whistler' can overheat enemy weapons, and his ultimate 'Tempest' buffs not only him but his entire team with infinite ammunition for a period of time. \n Read more",

We don't get to see much of that in today's teaser, but there is a vaguely amusing musical bait-and-switch, a bit of aerial footage, and thankfully - given the video game series' vehicular combat roots - at least one shot of a car with some guns stuck to the front.\r\n \nRead more",

This means that, in Valve's words, \"yes, you can watch movies while you play games if you really want to\" (although, I think it really meant this feature to be more for things like guides and notes). \r\n\n\r\nAs for those notes, this update adds a Notes app. The app does pretty much everything you would expect it to. It lets you take down notes about your game, and comes with \"rich text formatting, the ability to have multiple notes per game, and can even be used in offline mode\". Your notes will be saved per game, and are then synced to other PCs that you are logged into.\r\n \nRead more",
