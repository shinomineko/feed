And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>",

We’ve tracked publicly known in-the-wild 0-day exploits in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit#gid=0\">this spreadsheet</a> since mid-2014.</p>\n<p>While we often talk about the number of 0-day exploits used in-the-wild, what we’re actually discussing is the number of 0-day exploits detected and disclosed as in-the-wild.

We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate &#8220;backdoor key&#8221;, the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees. ...</p></blockquote>",

However, context is important for fully understanding something, be it socially or in software development, and this deserves a more in-depth review. Alongside the dockershim removal in Kubernetes v1.24, we’ve seen some confusion (sometimes at a panic level) and dissatisfaction with this decision in the community, largely due to a lack of context around this removal. The decision to deprecate and eventually remove dockershim from Kubernetes was not made quickly or lightly. Still, it’s been in the works for so long that many of today’s users are newer than that decision, and certainly newer than the choices that led to the dockershim being necessary in the first place.\nSo wh…",

These all sound very nice, with balancing tweaks and economy changes across the board, but let's talk about the true star of the show - Hellraid's new (and only) firearm. Or, to give it its proper name, the Deathbringer shotgun.\nA far cry from its fellow axes and swords of old, this shotgun is obtained by completing the Loaded for the Undead bounty (thanks, RPS) and certainly packs a powerful punch. Those pesky skeletons do not stand a chance, and will soon crumble into a bony pile of, well, bones thanks to the Deathbringer.

However, what if someone took this tied and tested formula, but then added in some of the classic 20th Television characters in place of Mario and co.? Well, we now have the answer. You would get Warped Kart Racers, Apple Arcade's upcoming karting game.\nIn Warped Kart Racers, players will be able to control one of 20 characters, including Hank from King of the Hill, Stan from American Dad! and Stewie from Family Guy to name but a few. In addition to these familiar faces, players will also recognise some familiar locales, as the maps that we could all soon be charging round are inspired by locations from \"fan-favourite episodes\".\nKeen karters will be able to take to the tracks in either Warped Kart Racers' single player campaign or take part in a chaotic 8-player multiplayer mode. In addition to this, you will also be able to take on daily challenges to unlock new characters, skins, karts and other customisation options. You can check out the trailer for Warped Kart Racers below.\n Read more",

Disciple, for instance, will offer the \"classic Sifu experience\", and it's the option for those that want to continue playing the game as it is now.\nStudent, however, is designed for those wanting a slightly easier ride. It'll make the experience \"more forgiving but still challenging\", by increasing player health, making ageing more forgiving, and introducing weaker enemies with less aggressive AI that use simplified combos.\r\n \nRead more",

The latter promises to deliver a diverse range of biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece - and we got an extended tour in a subsequent video.\r\n \nRead more",

They offer an escape from the mundane rigger of everyday life and give us the chance to experience whole new worlds of fantasy and adventure. However, while Marvel's Guardians of the galaxy certainly does this in spades with its eclectic cast and bustling locales, there is one area that is (for me at least) just like home. \nYes, I am talking about that damn fridge on the Milano that just will not stay shut. No matter how many times you get Star-Lord to close the door, it will always reopen again (and again and again and again).\nBut it turns out I am not alone in my quest to get that door closed (we need to save energy here people). In fact, that little seemingly benign door has been closed a grand total of 18.6m times. Much like the Guardians of Galaxy devs do as well, I admire the tenacity. \n Read more",

But while Sony's lips remain officially sealed, it appears the first batch of retro games coming to the top-end Premium tier have begun leaking onto PSN.\r\n\n\r\nPlayStation Plus' new Premium tier gives subscribers access to around 340 additional games beyond the library of 400 PS4 and PS5 titles included in the mid-range Extra tier, focusing on retro games from PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3, and PSP. Sony is yet to offer specifics on either library, but users on Reddit have spotted that new listings for classic titles, complete with new thumbnail art, are starting to appear in the PSN backend, pointing to the beginnings of a roll-out for PlayStation Plus' retro games.\r\n\n\r\nGranted, there are only three such titles to be found at present, all from publisher Bandai Namco - Tekken 2 and Mr. Driller for PlayStation 1, and Ridge Racer for PSP - but it does suggests the floodgates are slowly starting to open as publishers move to get their classic titles in order ready for the new PlayStation Plus launch.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, wonder no more, as Call of the Sea developer Out of the Blue has today announced its latest game - American Arcadia - and it looks like that is just what it's going to be. \nYou can check out the new teaser for yourself below.\nAmerican Arcadia tasks players with escaping a seemingly idyllic life of luxury. However - plot twist (which admittedly I may have spoiled with my opening sentence) - this life is not all it is cracked up to be. Rather, residents in this apparent utopia are under the watchful gaze of \"countless anonymous observers\". Shudders.\n Read more",

          "description": "After a controversial launch and a series of updates focussed on course correction, Gran Turismo 7 got its first proper content drop today, bringing three new cars and a sort of new track into the mix, as well as a suite of fixes and new features. \r\n\n\r\nLet's get the disappointing bit out the way first - the new track on offer is the 24-hour layout of the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium, which makes bold and daring changes to the layout you'll likely know well by…. Changing the position of the start/finish straight. So it's the same track you know and love, with Eau Rouge serving as the first corner rather than La Source, but this new configuration inspired by the round-the-clock race does at least suggest extended support of Gran Turismo 7's time-of-day feature. \r\n\n\r\nIn terms of new cars, leading the charge is the Subaru BRZ GT300 which was seen challenging and indeed conquering last year's Super GT series, and it's joined by its road legal offspring the freshly tweaked Subaru BRZ S. For lovers of kei cars there's a neat surprise in the diminutive form of the Suzuki Cappucino EA11R from 1991 (you'll find it on sale in the used car dealership). \r\n \nRead more",

At the height of Switch's Joy-Con drift issues, Nintendo's repair centre was reportedly receiving “easily thousands\" of faulty units each week, necessitating the establishment of new workplace specifically for controller repairs.\n Read more",

That game - according to new figures released by Techland today - has now sold 20m copies since launching a little over seven years ago in 2015, meaning its follow-up really is off to a flying start.\r\n\n\r\nAll that suggests a healthy future for Dying Light 2 - doubtlessly reassuring for Techland, given the developer has already committed to five years of post-launch DLC support for the game. Already that promise has brought the likes of new armour, weapons, events, and challenges to the game, with the first bit of substantial post-launch story content scheduled to arrive this June.\r\n \nRead more",

The same is true of the game's \"Hard Missions\".\nA bonus listed simply as \"Letterbox Background\" is highlighted as being available in either the Premium Fun Pack DLC or the separate Start Dash Pack DLC - free but only if you pre-order.\n Read more",

As transcribed by VGC, Grubb began by saying early word on the game appeared to be positive, with those who've played it being \"very impressed with the way it feels.\"\r\n\n\r\nAccording to Grubb, EA's goal with Skate 4 is to modernise the series while retaining its much-loved skating core, with some of the new features said to be akin to those seen in the likes of Forza or other modern multiplayer games. These reportedly includes ample customisation options for characters - \"a lot of skins, skins for your board, things like that\", Grubb explained - as well as user-generated content, which Skate 4 will \"really emphasise\".\r\n \nRead more",

It's a feature commonly found - and widely accepted, if not enjoyed - in free mobile titles, which now seems to be on the way to your PlayStation and Xbox.\nIt's fair to say that few people enjoy advertising and it's unlikely you'd opt into seeing more of it - but do Microsoft and Sony see this as a way to encourage new, smaller developers into the console space? Of course, a lot depends on how these plans are implemented - and here we chew over a few ways that could be worse than others.\nFinally, to lighten the mood, we have a chat about Amy Hennig's return to the Star Wars universe and the sheer number of upcoming games set in the galaxy far, far away we now have to look forward to.

The announcement came via the just-finished Meta Gaming Showcase event - and you can play the mode for yourself now, or watch our Ian try it for himself just below.\r\n\nMercenaries, a wave-based PVE mode found in several Resident Evil titles, is a fan-favourite - and not least in Resident Evil 4, where you face hordes of ganados against the clock while attempting to land a high score. But this fresh version of Mercenaries for Meta Quest 2 includes an array of new options and unlockable extras - including online leaderboards and 20 Challenges which mix up Mercenaries' gameplay in new ways.\nChallenges include options which restrict gameplay to just knives or rocket launchers, or shroud the map in fog. Complete these, and you'll gain access to other all-new additions such as a Big Head Mode, speedy Fast Forward mode, and a black-and-white Classic Horror Mode for the main Resi 4 campaign. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Developer Ludeon Studios' widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim RimWorld has had its Refused Classification status rescinded in Australia following a successful appeal, meaning its effective ban in the region has been overturned.\nThe notoriously sensitive Australian Classification Board initially refused to grant RimWorld a rating in March after its publisher Double Eleven Limited submitted the game for an upcoming \"multi platform\" launch, prohibiting it from release and effectively banning it from sale. The decision even affected the long-available Steam version of RimWorld, preventing new purchases from being made on Valve's digital store.\nNo specific reason was given for the board's decision at the time, with its website only referencing its usual boilerplate copy for games refused a rating, saying RC titles are those that \"depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified.\"\n Read more",

Additionally, the developer has confirmed 2008's Wrath of the Lich King expansion will come to World of Warcraft Classic later this year.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, Dragonflight, which grants access to the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind, the Dragon Isles, recently reawakened following a period of calamity for Azeroth. This new region - described as lush and primal, bursting with elemental energy - will incorporate everything from icy wastes and magma areas to lush forests and vibrant coasts across its four standard areas (bringing the likes of new dungeons and raids) and new starting zone. \r\n\n\r\nThe Dragon Isles starting area is home to the Dracthyr Evokers, a new playable race-class hybrid that will begin their WoW journey at level 58 and can align with either the Horde or the Alliance. Evokers will have two customisable forms - their draconic avatars used in battle, plus humanoid forms deployed when interacting with Azeroth's inhabitants - and, depending on players' chosen class specialisations, can either focus on damage dealing or healing.\r\n \nRead more",

Just before the opening sequences began rolling, North was asked more about how this final version of the game came about. Clearly not wanting to shy away from the elephant in the room, North went straight into chatting about Hennig, and the changes made after she left the game's development.\n\"The biggest thing most people probably remember is... we had shot Uncharted 4 with Amy Hennig for about seven months. We were well into the game. And she was dismissed from Naughty Dog... and they got rid of everything we did,\" North recalled.\n Read more",

It also offered a brief summary of where things will be heading following the conclusion of last season, revealing that it'll see Geralt taking Ciri of Cintra into hiding.\r\n\n\r\n\"Entrusted with Ciri’s magical training,\" the streaming service explained, \"Yennefer leads them to the protected fortress of Aretuza, where she hopes to discover more about the girl’s untapped powers; instead, they discover they’ve landed in a battlefield of political corruption, dark magic, and treachery.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Elaborating on his claims the new Need for Speed would \"be photo-realistic, but it’s going to have on top of that, anime elements\", Grubb (as thanks VGC) explained, \"You know when you see a car commercial or something like that and the car’s driving around, but then cartoons flames and stuff are flying off it? That’s the kind of the aesthetic that they seem to be going for.\"\nAway fron Need for Speed's new visual style, Grubb also claimed the racer will take place in a fictionalised version of Chicago, known as Lake Shore City, and that various familiar features would be returning for this latest Need for Speed instalment. These are said to include Autolog and its multiplayer focused social tools, plus the ability to \"customise all the pieces of your car\".\n Read more",

Attachments will, for instance, receive an overhaul in Update 4.0, with DICE aiming to ensure all feel unique and have an impact on loadout choices and gunplay.\nAdditionally, XP for Support Actions and Teamplay has been balanced \"to ensure teamwork remains king\", and there are balancing changes arriving for Vehicular Warfare in a bid to give Infantry/Vehicle counter play \"some bite\".\r\n \nRead more",

And while it might be relatively low on frills right now, it does at least feature a fairly solid range of options when it comes to ways to play.\nFor starters, there's a solo mode, pitting players against an AI opponent, but also some competitive PvP for those that prefer to test their word prowess against living, breathing challengers - be they randoms or friends - all served up in selectable flavours of match length, lasting between 3 and 45 minutes.\r\n \nRead more",

A state of California lawyer involved in the lawsuit has resigned, accusing the state's governor of interfering in the case in support of Activision Blizzard.\r\n\n\r\nAs reported by Bloomberg, the assistant chief counsel for California’s Department of Fair Employment, Melanie Proctor, has quit her role in protest after California Governor Gavin Newsom \"abruptly fired\" the agency's boss, Chief Counsel Janette Wipper. A representative for the two attorneys has since confirmed the firing and resignation to Bloomberg.\r\n\n\r\nIn an email to staff seen by the publication, Proctor claimed Governor Gavin Newsom and his office had begun to \"interfere\" with the Activision lawsuit in recent weeks. “The Office of the Governor repeatedly demanded advance notice of litigation strategy and of next steps in the litigation,” Proctor wrote. “As we continued to win in state court, this interference increased, mimicking the interests of Activision’s counsel.”\r\n \nRead more",

Subsequently, it has served as a co-developer for 343 on Halo Waypoint, Reach, Halo 4 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.\r\n\n\r\nIts continued work on the series with Halo Infinite comes as little surprise, then, but the language it has used - and an earlier report on what it might be up to - point to a major addition to Infinite coming from Certain Affinity in the future.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you've been itching to turn to the darker side in No Man's Sky, developer Hello Games' exploratory space sim has you covered in its new Outlaws update, giving players the chance to trade their life of relatively wholesome interplanetary meandering and base building for one of rather more criminal pursuits as they take on the role of fearsome space pirates.\r\n\n\r\nJust as February's Sentinels update sought to improve ground combat, Outlaws aims to do the same for space combat. That means better ship handling, shields for enemy starships, plus visual enhancements and various specialist secondary effects for weapons. The latter for instance, might give players the ability to slow enemy engines or disable their shield systems. Additionally, combat can now move down into a planet's atmosphere and AI pirates can even attack your settlements - and if all that sounds a little intimidating, Hello Games has introduced a new Auto-Follow mode to improve combat accessibility.\r\n\n\r\nElsewhere, there's a brand-new class of ship in the form of the sleek, solar-powered, and rather unimaginatively named Solar Starship (plus the maximum number of ships players can store has now been increased to nine), and it's now possible to create squadrons, recruiting and upgrading AI wingmen, each with their own unique abilities, for assistance in battle. Oh, and all ships now have high-capacity (and expandable) cargo inventories for specialist goods.\r\n \nRead more",

There's a definite air of the fondly remembered Dungeons & Dragons' animated outing about it, for instance (with a little bit of arcade cult-classic Dragon's Lair thrown in), which is entirely fitting given Beamdog describes its game as a first-person swords & sorcery adventure.\nAt MythForce's core is a roguelite dungeon-crawling experience that sees up to four co-op players - in the role of either Victoria the valiant Knight, Rico the charming Rogue, Maggie the wise Mage, and Hawkins the deadly Hunter - storming a colourful cartoon castle packed with \"treasure, traps, and terrors\". Beamdog is promising to arm players with \"legendary weapons and powerful magic\" as they attempt to survive the forces of evil within.\n Read more",

          "description": "After its game-changing reveal on PlayStation 5 and following a period of early access, Unreal Engine 5 is finally available for general download. In combination with the release, Epic is releasing a cut-down, Keanu-free rendition of the remarkable The Matrix Awakens demo alongside a sample game project to experiment with, called Lyra. UE5's release takes centre stage in today's State of Unreal virtual event, and we're told to expect a range of tech deep dives surrounding the technology alongside the launch of the engine itself.\r\n\n\r\nUE5 takes the established Unreal Engine 4.27 and adds full support for a number of key next generation technologies. We've already seen these in action, of course. Lumen is Epic's take on a fully real-time global illumination solution, eliminating the need to rely on static, pre-calculated 'baked' lighting, leaning into hardware accelerated ray tracing where appropriate. Nanite is UE5's virtualised micro-polygon technology, delivering incredibly granular detail from assets of motion picture quality and the elimination of geometry 'pop-in'. \r\n\n\r\nThe demands of these systems are such that native rendering at 4K resolution is not feasible on today's game consoles and that ties into another key feature: Temporal Super Resolution. Recently seen for the first time in a non-UE5 title – Ghostwire: Tokyo – TSR is the best software-based temporal upscaling solution we've seen to date. In upscaling from a native 1080p to 4K – a 2x resolution boost on both axes – the quality is comparable (if not quite as good as) Nvidia's DLSS.\n Read more",
