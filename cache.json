The scene on deck looks like a mechanic&#8217;s garage where an oil change has gone terribly wrong. Scores of fishing lines extend into the water, each bearing specialized hooks operated by automated reels. When they pull a squid on board, it squirts warm, viscous ink, which coats the walls and floors. Deep-sea squid have high levels of ammonia, which they use for buoyancy, and a smell hangs in the air. The hardest labor generally happens at night, from 5 P.M. until 7 A.M. Hundreds of bowling-ball-size light bulbs hang on racks on both sides of the vessel, enticing the squid up from the depths.

In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Persi Diaconis. The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started&#8212;Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51%.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And the final paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Could future coin tossers use the same-side bias to their advantage? The magnitude of the observed bias can be illustrated using a betting scenario. If you bet a dollar on the outcome of a coin toss (i.e., paying 1 dollar to enter, and winning either 0 or 2 dollars depending on the outcome) and repeat the bet 1,000 times, knowing the starting position of the coin toss would earn you 19 dollars on average. This is more than the casino advantage for 6 deck blackjack against an optimal-strategy player, where the casino would make 5 dollars on a comparable bet, but less than the casino advantage for single-zero roulette, where the casino would make 27 dollars on average. These considerations lead us to suggest that when coin flips are used for high-stakes decision-making, the starting position of the coin is best concealed...</p></blockquote>",

Once a sufficient number of teams are signed up, Captain Briggsy appears to hand them all two maps maps - one pointing to a chest containing the fabled skull, the other to the key required to open it - whereupon a messy dash to retrieve them both is likely to ensue. But there's a little more mischief once the cursed skull has been found: any ship that houses it will significantly slow down, meaning it's likely to change hands a number of times before one dedicated crew manages to cash it in at an outpost.\r\n \nRead more",

That means you won't have to lock down huge chunks of your profile just to avoid difficult questions about the amount of time you've been playing Coquettish Elbow Reveal VR Edition.

          "description": "As reports of a Switch successor continue to build momentum, despite carefully phrased rebuffs from Nintendo, the Mario maker has said it'll continue to release titles for its current console \"without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle.\"\r\n\n\r\nNintendo made the statement (thanks GameInformer) as part of its latest earnings report - in which it also confirmed Switch sales have now surpassed 132m units - writing, \"Switch will be entering its eighth year in March 2024. We will continue to release new titles and content for Nintendo Switch without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle.\" \r\n\n\r\nThe inference (which isn't the same as confirmation, of course) is that should a Switch successor launch next year, as is widely reported, Nintendo won't be viewing it as end-of-life for its existing machine. That's perhaps not much of a surprise given it'll still have a substantial number of current Switch owners clamouring for new content with no plans to immediately upgrade, but it's something of a departure from its traditional release strategy.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Time Splitters studio Free Radical is reportedly the latest developer to be affected by Embracer Group's sweeping restructuring programme, with the studio said to be facing closure.\r\n\n\r\nFree Radical's history is a long one and complicated one; the studio was founded in 1999 by a number of ex-Rare developers and quickly made a name for itself with the much-loved TimeSplitters FPS series. In 2009, after several difficult years, it was acquired by Crytek, becoming Crytek UK, who then sold it to Deep Silver in 2014, where it became Dambuster Studios - which made this year's Dead Island 2. However, in May 2021, Deep Silver announced it was reviving the Free Radical name and creating a new studio specifically to make more TimeSplitters, with original Free Radical co-founders Steve Ellis and David Doak at the helm.\r\n\n\r\nUnfortunately, VGC now reports this new Free Radical is the latest studio to be impacted by parent company Embracer Group's major restructuring programme, which was announced following the collapse of a massive $2bn deal in May and has resulted in extensive layoffs and closures throughout 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Two months on from the release of Starfield, players are still waiting for Bethesda to address the numerous bugs which are present. But there's a whole other group of players out there taking matters into their own hands - the team behind the Starfield Community Patch, an ambitious and surprisingly professional taskforce trying to fix the game themselves. The project came under the spotlight about a month before Starfield released. It was wild to think that a group of modders could already be working on a mod for Starfield before it had even released, but there they were - anticipating the Bethesda jank fans have come to expect. \r\n\n\r\nThe SCP's goal is to improve the vanilla experience of Starfield for players by fixing everything from major bugs to spelling errors, so long as it presents some sort of issue for players of the base game. The scope of the patch doesn't include new content, balance changes (outside of correcting obvious errors), or anything which doesn't fit with Bethesda's original vision for the game.\r\n\n\r\nI spoke to Timothy \"Halgari\" Baldridge, one of the founders of the SCP, to find out why the team came together to, in essence, do Bethesda's work for them, and ask whether they've ever had any contact with Bethesda. I came away from our chat with a deeper appreciation for the project, which is more than just a simple effort to improve the experience of Starfield. It's a collaborative effort between several modders and players to create a truly community-owned, open-source project, with standard practices of software development in place.\r\n \nRead more",

This new World of Warcraft story arc is set to play out across multiple expansions over the next few years, starting with The War Within - WoW's tenth expansion - in 2024.\r\n\n\r\nThe War Within takes players into heart of Azeroth itself, where they'll explore new subterranean kingdoms, engage with ancient cultures like the Earthen Dwarves - a new Allied race - and the terrifying Nerubians of Azj-Kahet. Azj-Kahet is one of several new zones coming in the expansion, alongside the Isle of Dorn, The Ringing Deeps, and Hallowfall.\r\n \nRead more",

As per studio Poncle's latest development update, a new story driven, lore-infused Adventures mode will soon be on the way.\r\n\n\r\nPoncle has teased Adventures before, describing them as a remix of content adding a bit of extra \"flavour\" through new stage progression and descriptions. Now though, via the medium of FAQ it's gone into considerably more detail, explaining Adventures are essentially self-contained miniature story campaigns - some available as part of the base game, others tied to specific DLC - that'll follow the game's cast of Survivors on a series of \"wacky sidequests.\"\r\n\n\r\nAdventures unlock at set points during the main game or their associated DLC, and feature a unique progression path that'll see players starting from scratch (main game unlocks won't be affected) using a specific character and item set-up as they attempt to complete a series of custom challenges with a limited arsenal. Those challenges might, for instance, require players to survive a certain amount of time or kill a set amount of enemies, and there'll be bits of lore text forming a mini story arc along the way.\r\n \nRead more",

So what's next, if Nintendo can't simply go bigger? Fresh ideas are needed, we feel. \nWhen will the Mario Kart series get a course creator? Is this the time - so that Nintendo can hand over some creative control to the community, and run the game as more of a live service platform? How about changes to the game's characters, with special abilities to make different racers feel unique? And what about the idea of turning Mario Kart into more of a Nintendo Kart, with additional crossover franchises? Joining me to discuss are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan. \n Read more",

Bloomberg later reported around 100 employees - approximately eight percent of Bungie's 1200-strong workforce - were affected by the job cuts, and that the layoffs followed internal warnings that studio revenue was 45 percent below projections due to a \"sharp drop\" in the popularity of Destiny 2.\r\n\n\r\nFurther reports have continued to paint a bleak picture of Destiny 2's fortunes; pre-orders for The Final Shape are said to be disappointing, while \"good\" rather than \"great\" feedback has reportedly lead management to delay the expansion from February to June next year.\r\n \nRead more",

Finally though, after much waiting, the heist-shooter's 1.01 update is here on all platforms.\r\n\n\r\nPayday 3's 1.01 update was initially planned to launch on 5th October, but developer Starbreeze delayed its release to mid-October in order to \"ensure its stability\". After weeks of silence, the developer re-emerged to announced another, this time indefinite delay, explaining it had \"identified some issues that need to be fixed\".\r\n\n\r\nAs the wait has dragged on, Payday 3 player numbers have slumped to the low thousands, with the game's predecessor currently pulling in ten times more than the new version. As such, Starbreeze will doubtless be hoping the long-awaited arrival of 1.01 today will help reverse the game's fortunes. And it's a big one too, weighing in at 2GB (on PC, at least) and spanning an enormous number of improvements and changes.\r\n \nRead more",

It's up to players to uncover the king's secrets by exploring a new area of Losomn - the announcement makes mention of a castle overlooking a Dran coastal town, but doesn't explicitly confirm that this is where the DLC is set - containing new dungeons and \"unexpected allies\".\r\n\n\r\nThere's also talk of powerful new weapons and equipment for players to acquire - including new modifications, amulets, and rings - plus fearsome new enemies and bosses, risen from the depths of the ocean and now swarming the streets. And finally, there's the new Ritualist archetype, which can leverage status effects to punish foes.\r\n \nRead more",

Despite these instructions, Reuters said it had documented six cases – in Britain, France, Austria, Germany, and Holland – where the adverts had been served in games for children or families.\r\n \nRead more",

The slump is said to be the result of a \"sharp drop\" in the popularity of Destiny 2, with Bungie CEO Pete Parsons having reportedly highlighted weak player retention at the time.\r\n\n\r\nIn that same meeting, according to Bloomberg sources in attendance, Parsons told employees that Destiny 2's next expansion, The Final Shape - which concludes the game's current Light and Darkness saga - was only getting \"good\" rather than \"great\" feedback. As such, management was planning to delay its release to improve the product.\r\n \nRead more",

In its original guise, it specialised in porting arcade games over to the likes of Game Boy Colour and PlayStation; that emulation work has continued in the years since despite organisational changes, first as it become Backbone Entertainment following a merger in 2003, and again after the Digital Eclipse brand was purchased and revived by former employees in 2015.\r\n\n\r\nIn more recent times, the studio's emulation work has included the Blizzard Arcade Collection, Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, but last year's interactive digital documentary Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration - which blended new video interviews, archival material, and playable games to form an exhaustive record of Atari's history - was particularly well-recieved. The studio then launched its Gold Master Series earlier this year, taking a similarly thorough approach to individual classic games, starting with the acclaimed The Making of Karateka.\r\n \nRead more",

Crucially, the cross-progression migration process is both automatic and mandatory, meaning there's a fair amount those who play across multiple platforms will likely want to know in preparation.\r\n\n\r\nFor starters, players who've accrued different progress levels across multiple platforms will soon have all that smushed together into a single account. Respawn will generate the stats of this new account based on what it's calling a player's \"primarily platform\" - that is, the one with the highest level reached across all platforms. Stats/progress of all other accounts will be lost.\r\n \nRead more",

Eight years after its initial release, Rocksteady's third entry in the Arkham series has been updated to add an unexpected bit of new content - but it appears the celebrations might have been a bit premature.\r\n\n\r\nEarlier today, Batman fans began reporting the Epic Games Store version of 2015's Batman: Arkham Knight had received an update specifically adding Robert Pattinson's Batsuit, from last year's movie reboot, as a wearable skin.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a bit of an odd discovery for all sorts of reasons, not least because neither Rocksteady nor publisher Warner Bros. announced or acknowledged its arrival. The Pattsuit's apparent Epic Games Store exclusivity also seemed like a bit of a strange choice too, and the mystery only deepened when the suit reportedly vanished not long after word of its release began to spread.\r\n \nRead more",

The massive in-game storm at Storm Point has now cleared the map and things look a little different to how we remember it, meaning there's plenty of new areas to explore as you fight to survive.\nFirst off, let's talk about brand new Legend Conduit. We now know more about her abilities, as well as how she came to get her equipment and suit. Conduit began as a fan of Apex Legends and is now stoked to be part of the Apex Games themselves - but she didn't join just for fame or fun, as she's got a family to take care of. She's described as having a good sense of humour and being fascinated with the tech used in the games.\nAn interesting fact for any Titanfall fans is that Conduit uses a radioactive battery from a modified Monarch Titan to power her suit and gadgets. She went exploring on a highly-radiated battlefield and came across the battery. She then stole it and uses it to take her place in the Apex Games - but at a cost. The battery itself is poisoning Conduit, and though we're not sure how this will impact her story as we move ahead, we're a bit worried about her long-term chances.\n Read more",

          "description": "Microsoft's Xbox Partner Preview showcase might have an exceptionally rubbish name, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's not worth a watch! Tonight's latest instalment was a pretty decent offering all-round, that, while perhaps not exciting as such, did at least have some interesting reveals. There was first footage of Konami's Metal Gear Sold 3 remake, a new game from PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab, and more. And if you're looking for a summary of it all that won't take up 30 minutes of your time, then read on.\r\n\n\r\nFirst up, we learned Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will continue the series' tradition of extravagant side activities when it releases on 26th January next year, giving players the opportunity to manage an entire tropical island resort in pure Animal Crossing fashion. There's fishing, bug catching, crafting, and a whole lot more as detailed in the trailer below.\r\n\n\r\nPowerWash simulator developer FuturLab unveiled its new game Ikaro: Will Not Die, a  spiritual successor to the studio's acclaimed Velocity series that promises \"satisfying flow-state\" rogue-lite action that you can read more about elsewhere.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, would you believe it, there's a game just for you; it's called Still Wakes the Deep and first gameplay has just debuted.\r\n\n\r\nAnnounced back in June, Still Wakes the Deep is the latest from developer The Chinese Room - previously responsible for the likes of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Dear Esther - whisking players to the Beira D oil rig off the Scottish coast circa 1975.\r\n\n\r\nWhat follows is a narrative-focused first-person horror adventure in which players, in the role of an off-shore oil rig worker suddenly cut off from the outside world, must \"run, climb, and swim through the flooding corridors and storm-lashed outer decks\" as they attempt to evade an unspeakable otherworldly forces that's invited itself onboard.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "FuturLab, the developer behind nozzle-tweaking masterwork PowerWash Simulator, has unveiled neon-streaked action-adventure Ikaro: Will Not Die, which the studio describes a spiritual successor to its acclaimed Velocity series.\r\n\n\r\nVelocity, for the uninitiated, began life as twitchy shoot-'em-up in which players piloted their ship (known as the Quarp Jet) through space in a blaze of enemy-shredded bullets. Its sequel, 2014's Velocity 2X, retained the acclaimed ship-bound action of the original, but paired it with regular on-foot sections requiring protagonist to Lieutenant Kai Tana to disembark and solve a few puzzles to clear the way forward. Eurogamer liked it a lot!\r\n\n\r\nBut back to Ikaro: Will Not Die; it's being billed as an action-adventure rogue-lite, that \"brings the pace and precision of [the Velocity series'] satisfying flow-state action into third-person, while infusing an array of exciting new systems and mechanics.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ark: Survival Ascended - the Unreal Engine 5 remake of dino-survival hit Ark: Survival Evolved - is surprise-launching onto PC today, 25th October. However, developer Wildcard has announced a further delay for the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions, with both now due to arrive some time in November.\r\n\n\r\nThere has, of course, been a fair bit of controversy surrounding Ark: Survival Ascended since its announcement back in April this year; its reveal came with the news that Wildcard would be taking Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers offline when the remake arrived, forcing players to upgrade to the new version if they wanted to stay put. \r\n\n\r\nIt didn't help, either, that the remake was initially only available as part of a bundle with the now-delayed Ark 2, and while Wildcard eventually scrapped those plans, it instead decided to release a standalone version of Ark: Survival Ascended that was - amazingly - exactly the same price as the original bundle, despite featuring one less game. However, that price recently fell by $5 to $44.99 after Wildcard reversed plans to include a remake of Ark's Scorched Earth expansion alongside the base map, which it said would no longer be ready for launch.\r\n \nRead more",

And if your nerves are up to the challenge, the Halloween Update launches today.\r\n\n\r\nFrictional's creative lead Fredrik Olsson began teasing a hardcore Shell Shock mode last month, detailing a few of the sadistic features it would bring, but with it now here as part of today's Halloween Update, the studio has provided a little more information on what's in store.\r\n\n\r\nFor starters, as previously confirmed, The Bunker's Admin Office will no longer be the safe haven it once was in Shell Shock mode; its reassuringly sturdy steel doors are replaced with wood, meaning, yes, the monster can get in. And speaking of that pursuing horror, Shell Shock mode gives it new behaviours designed to increase its unpredictability.\r\n \nRead more",

Tim joins him for breakfast, only to find his flan has been taken from the fridge, so the pair get to work to figure out who took it.

          "description": "Microsoft has detailed its earnings for the first quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, pointing to a record-breaking Q1 for Xbox gaming revenue, despite a 7% drop in hardware sales.\r\n\n\r\nOver the course of Microsoft's Q1 2024, which covers 1st July to 30th September, Xbox generated $3.9bn USD in gaming revenue - equating to a 9% year-on-year increase - which the company attributed to strong performance from first-party titles and Game Pass.\r\n\n\r\nNot coincidentally, Xbox's record-breaking Q1 encompassed the long-awaited launch of Bethesda's Starfield, which surpassed 10m players within its first few weeks of release - and in an investor call following today's fiscal report, Microsoft CEO Satyda Nadella confirmed the game provided a significant boost for Game Pass, setting the record at launch for the \"most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever\" (as per The Verge's Tom Warren).\r\n \nRead more",

The only catch - and it's admittedly quite a big one - is that it'll cost a whopping $200.\r\n\n\r\nThe region-free Annapurna Interactive Deluxe Limited Edition Collection, as the mega-priced cartridge is officially known, is being released in collaboration with video game collectibles company iam8bit and - as per the \"limited edition\" bit - is restricted to 2,500 copies.\r\n\n\r\nFor your hard-earned $199.99 USD (plus, of course, a hefty chunk of VAT and import fees if you're ordering from the UK), you'll get a cartridge containing Donut County, Gorogoa, Hindsight, I Am Dead, If Found..., Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition, Neon White, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Solar Ash, The Artful Escape, The Pathless, and What Remains of Edith Finch. That is, then, some top-notch gaming in a single square inch (or thereabouts) of plastic.\r\n \nRead more",

Additionally, money raised through spectator tickets and entry fees, capped at £18/€20 and £14/€15 a person respectively, must not exceed the costs of organising the tournament and raising prize money - although prize money (limited to a total of £4,500/€5,000) also cannot be generated from spectator ticket sales.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you've somehow missed out on developer Dennaton Games' classic Hotline Miami series - or are just looking for another excuse to revisit its woozily eccentric mayhem - you might like to know both games are now natively available for Xbox Series X/S and PS5.\r\n\n\r\nIt has, somewhat unbelievably, been over a decade since the critically lauded Hotline Miami first dropped jaws and quickened pulses with its breathless, blood-soaked top-down ode to violence, in which the game's unnamed protagonist rampages against the local Miami mafia after receiving cryptic instructions on his answering machine.\r\n\n\r\nIts grisly blend of stealth and ultra-gory shooting action - augmented by a surreal narrative, a stylish fever-dream aesthetic, and an absolute stunner of a pulsing synth soundtrack - immediately won it fans (Eurogamer awarded it 10/10 at the time of its release). 2015's Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number went bigger, weirder, and tougher in almost every conceievable way, but didn't have quite the same impact the second time around.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In a year that's seen significant moves toward unionisation across the games industry, Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has argued the reason the company doesn't have unions is because its workers have a \"high degree of job satisfaction and engagement\".\r\n\n\r\nBowser shared his thoughts in an interview with Inverse, saying, \"You only have to look at our retention numbers, which are very, very high within the industry, and our obviously low turnover rate as a result. Our focus has always been on creating a culture that's inclusive, has a work-life balance, and is focused on our singular mission of bringing smiles to faces.\"\r\n\n\r\nBowser added he believes Nintendo is \"on the right path\" when it comes to creating a \"work environment and culture that allows people to be productive, to have balance in their lives, and to grow within the company\".\r\n \nRead more",

There will be no immediate drop of Activision classics on Xbox Game Pass, and no sudden insertion of Master Chief in Call of Duty. \nLong-term, though, Spencer is keen to hear from Activision's teams about what they want to make - whether that's a return to Guitar Hero, Skylanders or Tony Hawk games, or something else entirely. We also ponder Microsoft's plans for a mobile game presence, driven by Candy Crush maker King. Could Gears of War turn up on mobile? What about Viva Piñata?

          "description": "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 released today, with a storyline that developer Insomniac has said will take, on average, about 15 hours to complete if you just stick to the main story missions. If players decide to delve deeper, and complete side missions and collectables, that gameplay time could be extended to around 40 hours. \r\n\n\r\nWhen it first came to light that Spider-Man 2's main story could be wrapped up in a relatively short amount of time - especially when compared to the likes of this year's Baldur's Gate 3, which can take players literal days to complete - some felt that Insomniac was asking too high a price for its sequel. Here in the UK, Spider-Man 2 is £69.99 for the standard PS5 edition. If players want to upgrade to the digital deluxe version, it will set them back £79.99. \r\n\n\r\nMany have argued that game length should influence the retail price of a product, and therefore Spider-Man 2 should be priced lower than what is essentially £70. Insomniac's creative director Bryan Intihar has weighed in on this, and said that Spider-Man 2 is absolutely \"worth it\". \r\n \nRead more",

Blood Gulch is even in there (although, actually that one wasn't really a surprise, but all the same very cool)\r\n\n\r\nThe possibilities this mode can invoke are seemingly endless, and the recent update that came with Season 5: Reckoning has made this even more apparent.

It's called the Chilling Update (because of all the snow, yes?) and it's available now.\r\n\n\r\nThe Chilling Update - also known as v1.7.0 - introduces a new playable character, a new bonus stage, a new evolving weapon, two new relics, six new EXTRA achievements, and a new music track.

Once inside, players will encounter snowmen insistent on blocking their path, and face enemies which, according to Poncle, move very slowly and are particularly susceptible to fire. \"So for most of it,\" the studio explains, \"there isn't anything particularly challenging\" - although you might want to save your spicy sausage for the boss.\r\n \nRead more",

As Nintendo did earlier in the year when it released its live-action Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, Microsoft seems to be highlighting the welcome relief games can provide, away from the everyday, rain-soaked mundane. \r\n\n\r\nThis young lady in question is soon swept out of her apartment block's lift and transported into a world of wonder and excitement. Starfield's Vasco holds her bag as a spaceship blasts off. Her world turns upside down again, as the wandering whispers of Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 surround her. She leaves, to suddenly find her corridor turned into a Forza racetrack, and then find a random Cyberpunk 2077 chap in her flat chopping up pineapples with furious force. You get the idea. \r\n \nRead more",

This theory has now been squashed by Insomniac's own director of core technologies Mike Fitzgerald.

Epic has whacked a free playable 20-minute Alan Wake recap episode that should serve as a refresher while offering a bit of spooky battery gobbling fun along the way.\r\n\n\r\nAlan's first adventure, released all the way back in 2010, sees the eponymous writer taking a working holiday with his wife, Alice, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls. Needless to say, it doesn't take long for things to go awry, and, soon, Alan - with occasional help from his agent BARRY - is monologuing his way through the night, blasting malevolent beings to smithereens with his torch and revealing the next big spooky event 10 seconds before it happens because he can't keep his mouth shut.\r\n\n\r\nOr at least that's how I remember it. Presumably Epic's newly released Alan Wake: Flashback - a 'reimagining' of the original tale, developed in collaboration with Remedy Entertainment, Spiral House, and Zen Creative - will do a better and more reliable job of filling you in on all the important story beats ahead of Alan Wake 2.\r\n \nRead more",

All that plays out through \"massive real-time group battles\", featuring up to ten fighters at once, that'll require players to tailor their team of four champions to take on progressively more difficult challenges.\r\n\n\r\nMore specifically, progress involves collecting and assembling a team from a \"massive\" catalogue of Assassins, Warriors, Snipers, and Defenders - including the familiar likes of Sub-Zero, Liu Kang, Scorpion, and Kitana, plus \"rare, fan-favourite variants\" such as Cyrax and Smoke. Each comes with its own unique Special Moves, Affinities and Passive Skills, and players will need to evolve their characters' combat skills, level their gear, and equip Relics.\r\n \nRead more",

Many have praised the game's action, slick traversal and story, but one area that has been highlighted away from your typical professional assessment is the puddles. \r\n\nSome players felt the first Spider-Man game was lacking in the puddle density department, noting the game's E3 2017 gameplay trailer had larger and better defined puddles than in the released version. This caused quite a stir on social media and was eventually dubbed \"puddlegate\".\n\r\nInsomniac took this all in its stride, and actually added a playful fix for Spider-Man's puddlegate in the form of puddle stickers. However, it's already clear its sequel won't need stickers to 'fix' its puddles, as they are looking pretty dense and wet from where I am sitting.\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, its gaming catalogue has swelled to over 70 titles and it's made a number notable acquisitions, including Triple Town and Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox, The Walking Dead mobile developer Next Games, and Oxenfree creator Night School Studio.\r\n\n\r\nHints of more ambitious gaming plans at Netflix came with last November's announcement the company had set up a new Los Angeles studio - lead by former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny - to create a brand-new triple-A, third-person RPG for PC. And a new report from the Wall Street Journal has shed further light on Netflix plans, saying the company is \"taking steps to expand into higher-end games that can be streamed from TVs or PCs.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Walder recently spoke to invenglobal at the Inven Game Conference in South Korea, where he discussed lessons learned from Cyberpunk 2077. \r\n\n\r\n\"This approach we had, the way we were working production-wise, creating demos, and moving towards an agile mindset and workflow - it's about ensuring we're on top of certain things from the start,\" Walder said. \"Take consoles, for example; we need to make sure they're functioning from the get-go. For our next project, Polaris [part of a new trilogy of games in CDPR's Witcher series], we're already running our demos and internal reviews on the console from the very beginning.\" \r\n \nRead more",
