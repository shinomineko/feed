The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries. By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba&#8217;s encryption and the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic, Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard from a target hotel&#8212;say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard out of a box of used ones&#8212;then reading a certain code from that card with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first rewrites a certain piece of the lock&#8217;s data, and the second opens it...</p></blockquote>",

(The basic idea is that, like lawyers and architects, there should be some professional licensing requirement for software engineers.) Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4759742\">law journal article</a> recommending the same idea for AI engineers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This Article proposes another way: professionalizing AI engineering. Require AI engineers to obtain licenses to build commercial AI products, push them to collaborate on scientifically-supported, domain-specific technical standards, and charge them with policing themselves. This Article&#8217;s proposal addresses AI harms at their inception, influencing the very engineering decisions that give rise to them in the first place. By wresting control over information and system design away from companies and handing it to AI engineers, professionalization engenders trustworthy AI by design. Beyond recommending the specific policy solution of professionalization, this Article seeks to shift the discourse on AI away from an emphasis on light-touch, ex post solutions that address already-created products to a greater focus on ex ante controls that precede AI development. We&#8217;ve used this playbook before in fields requiring a high level of expertise where a duty to the public welfare must trump business motivations. What if, like doctors, AI engineers also vowed to do no harm?...</p></blockquote>",

These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for free-form human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking. We also present a comprehensive taxonomical ontology of the types of adversarial prompts...</p></blockquote>",

Wonder, and Shiro Mouri, the game's director, gave us a glimpse, as they spoke with Eurogamer about their intentions for Super Mario Bros. Wonder.\nAt the time, Tezuka said \"There was a lot of feeling about creating something else, something new,\" with Mouri adding that \"in terms of the concept for creating a new Mario, we came up with the concept of mystery and secrets\".\nMuch of that was echoed by the pair's talk at GDC last week: Tezuka noted the team's mantra this time was \"Big Changes,\" while Mouri mentioned the sense of lingering familiarity again, and the desire to evolve things in light of it. Only this time they opened up a little further, offering detail on cut ideas, development approaches and more - but they began with the same point they made to us.\n Read more",

This has left many with a bitter taste in their mouths, and Dragon's Dogma 2 currently sits with a 'Mixed' review average on Steam.\nMany of the game's 7000+ user reviews on the platform have called the developer out for adding paid DLC into a single-player game. One item allows for you to revive your player. Another has caused upset is the Art of Metamorphosis - Character Editor DLC, which costs £1.69. As its name suggests, this one-time consumable gives users the ability to change the appearance of their Arisen, though Capcom does note players are also able to acquire this item in the game itself.\n Read more",

First up, there's the new double-barrelled flintlock, designed for shorter-range combat, which is capable of rapidly firing two shots individually before a reload is required. Alternatively, both shots can be fired simultaenously for a more powerful attack.\r\n\n\r\nThat's joined by the new throwing knife, which has a couple of different uses. It can give an opponent a quick (if not particularly powerful) stab, or it can be charged up to release a high damage attack that's particularly deadly if you can sneak up behind an enemy. And it won't surprise you to hear throwing knives can also be thrown to damage opponents at long distances. They'll also become embedded in environmental geometry, and you'll need to retrieve them to reload - unless your opponent gets there first and uses your blade against you.\r\n \nRead more",

Graphics card manufacturer Nvidia unveiled a new AI-powered chip, sending its stock price skyrocketing. And behind closed doors, Ubisoft demonstrated something of its own to a small collection of the press: a partnership with Inworld AI to create a prototype for \"Newly Evolving NPCs\", or NEO NPCs as Ubisoft calls them.\nIt's important to stress the \"prototype\" factor here. At the event, Ubisoft gave a brief presentation explaining the origins of its research team - led by Ubisoft Paris and a supporting Ubisoft Production Technology crew - and its goals, often referring to the project as an \"experiment\". After this I had a chance to sit down and actually \"play\" three, roughly 10-minute long demonstrations of the technology in action within a hypothetical game scenario. But while these demos were technically playable, they were explicitly described as an \"independent proof of concept\" for now. In a brief panel discussion after the hands-on time, Mélanie Lopez Malet, senior data scientist on the R&D team, said they were only just \"scratching the surface... implementation [in a real game] for me is not even on my radar.\"\nStill, this is one of the first working examples of generative AI being used in an actual, player-facing role from any major studio - and it does work. Sort of.\n Read more",

Sometimes, you are right. But being able to adopt the Wii early was a good move because we were able to do things we couldn't do before.

          "description": "Here's something to tide you over until Bungie releases its rebooted Marathon: there's a freeware fan revival for the 1994 FPS known as Classic Marathon, and it's coming to Steam \"soon\".\nThis project is from the same team that brought us Aleph One, an open source engine built for current systems based on the Marathon 2 source code (meaning you can access Marathon, Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity elsewhere, but not yet on Steam).\nWhile the team has promised Classic Marathon on Steam will be an authentic experience, there are of course a few extra bells and whistles to bring this revival up to more modern standards. For example, there will be optional widescreen HUD support and 60+ fps interpolation, which will improve the smoothness of the animation over the original without breaking the game logic. This is \"just in case the original is too authentic,\" the Classic Marathon team said.\n Read more",

          "description": "Inflexion Games, developer of Victorian fantasy survival crafting game Nightingale, has admitted there are several aspects of the game it's currently \"not happy with\", following disappointing player numbers at the game's recent launch. \r\n\n\r\nNightingale launched on 20th February with a Steam peak of 47,569 players, but this has trailed off ever since, and this week has seen active player counts in the single digit thousands. Meanwhile, player reviews are listed as \"mixed\". Studio boss Aaryn Flynn has said the team was now gathering feedback, and that the team was aware of several issues. \r\n\n\r\n\"We've been spending a lot of our time reading your impressions online, going through Discord, watching your streams and building our plans for the next phase of the game,\" Flynn shared. \"There are some things we are not happy with about the game,\" he continued, acknowledging Nightingale's network issues, missing quality of life improvements, and other aspects were \"not quite where we want them to be\". \r\n \nRead more",

Soon, however, they'll find themselves venturing beyond the town walls \"as they learn of a greater threat across the fantastical world of Adothria.\"\r\n\n\r\nThere's talk of \"quirky characters, fascinating foes and captivating locations\" for players to encounter as they explore the world, having adopted one of three classes: Cryoknight, Hammermage, or Guardian. These options are supposed to mark a break from the traditional likes of mage, rogue, and warrior, with Fen Research promises other \"new and exciting twists\" on the MMORPG genre, including a deliberate shift away from 'grindy' gameplay.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has opened up on his thoughts about the modern games industry, stating that \"exclusivity is the \"Achilles' heel\" of the modern development cycle.\nIn a candid interview with VentureBeat, Layden detailed how he thinks the industry has changed since he joined Sony in the 1980s, working his way up to become president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America in 2014. Now an adviser to companies like Tencent and Web3 ventures, Layden was quick to detail the problems he sees in platform exclusivity, especially as development costs continue to rocket.\n\"When your costs for a game exceed $200 million, exclusivity is your Achilles' heel,\" Layden said. \"It reduces your addressable market. Particularly when you're in the world of live-service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in.\n Read more",

Plus, a big 2024 content preview is on the way as part of Sea of Thieves' sixth anniversary celebrations.\r\n\n\r\nStarting with anti-cheat, Rare has confirmed it'll be introducing Epic's kernel-level Easy Anti-Cheat solution - as used by the likes of Fortnite and Apex Legends - to Sea of Thieves next Thursday, 14th March. There's not much more to report beyond its imminent arrival, but the news'll probably bring some reassurance if you think you've been privy to suspicious behaviour out on the seas. And I'm not talking spyglass dongs.\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, next week's update brings an interesting expansion to last year's Safer Seas mode. From next Thursday onward, it'll be possible for pirates to play alone on a Safer Seas private server without needing a Game Pass Core or Game Pass Ultimate subscription. The key points to note here are that this isn't an offline mode - Sea of Thieves is still intrinsically reliant on its servers - and any form of multiplayer, even in Safer Seas, will still require Game Pass.\r\n \nRead more",

And dare I say, it actually looks… decent? To my surprise, I quite liked it?\nI've rewatched the trailer several times now to see if there's any new information we can glean hidden in the details, and there are a few things worth pointing out (as well as some references to my all-time favourite in the series, Fallout: New Vegas).\n Read more",

Following a report into the claims by Kotaku, a number of game developers have spoken up to clear up misconceptions about what companies like Sweet Baby Inc. actually do. \nKenney, who has written for games including Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Telltale's The Walking Dead and the upcoming Marvel's Wolverine, posted a thread on X yesterday. \"Some of you don't seem to understand how narrative consulting on games works,\" she began, \"but don't worry: I do!\"\n Read more",

          "description": "Developer LocalThunk's Balatro might have hit a bit of a bump last week after an unexpected ratings change, but that hasn't stopped the acclaimed poker-inspired rogue-like deckbuilder from selling over half a million copies in ten days, according to publisher Playstack.\r\n\n\r\nThat's an impressive figure for what's a fairly unassuming card game at first glance. Balatro, if you're unfamiliar, challenges players to progress through a series of stage-like Blinds by exceeding each one's target score. A maximum of four poker hands can played each blind, and failure to reach the target, in classic rogue-like fashion, results in a game over.\r\n\n\r\nAs you can probably guess, though, there's a lot more to it than that, with successful Blinds rewarding in-game money to spend on the likes of fancy combo-boosting cards, exotic upgrades, and, crucially, a heap of rule-bending Jokers that quickly turn a relatively unremarkable set-up into an outlandish game of ludicrous, score-busting synergies.\r\n \nRead more",

The article has been amended to only mention Remake and Rebirth.\"\r\n\n\r\nOf course, with Remake and Rebirth still being described as PlayStation console exclusives in the Washington Post report (an assertion you'd assume has now been very thoroughly run by Sony and Square), it would be unusual if the third entry in the series proved to be an outlier - but for now, consider the exclusivity status of part three still unconfirmed.\r\n \nRead more",

Mediterranea Inferno, last year's dazzling visual novel from The Milky Way Prince creator Lorenzo Redaelli, is out now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.\r\n\n\r\nMediterranea Inferno follows a trio of beautiful, fashionable Milan club kids in their early 20s as they reunite, after two years apart due to lingering COVID restrictions, for a three-day vacation in the blazing heat of a southern Italian summer. What follows is an artfully orchestrated descent into nightmare - a vicious, emotionally pummelling, and unabashedly queer tale of friendship and post-COVID trauma where players, in Redaelli's own words, can push \"three bourgeois twinks...towards the most horrible and gruesome endings\".\r\n\n\r\nIt's an absolute sledgehammer of a game - \"a dense, provocative, playful, exasperating, horrifying, poetic, often very funny, and occasionally even profound rumination on the sometimes paralysing search for a place in the disenfranchising shadow of modern-day life\", as I wrote in my five star review - and easily the most relentlessly stylish game of 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

And it's proven to be a particularly controversial period of downtime, not only for its length but because Warner Bros. refused to refund players for any packs, passes, premium currency bundles, or cosmetics they'd purchased across MutliVersus' nearly year-long, multi-season open beta, insisting all purchased items would be usable again once the game returned.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "This weekend, Fortnite simultaneously did something it had never done before, and something it hadn't done in ages. On the game's storied battle royale Island, players looked on as a giant hand made out of rapidly-cooling lava burst out of the ground, clasping an enormous treasure box that then lay, danging, high up in the air. \r\n\n\r\nThe hand's appearance had been much anticipated. Rhythmic rumblings had been tracked by fans to a spot outside Ruined Reels - a sort-of Greek amphitheature turned open-air cinema - and a slowly widening crack in the ground nearby. A new character, the aptly-named Odyssey, had already appeared nearby to dole out some much-needed exposition and teasing for Fortnite's incoming Ancient Greek-themed new season. And outside the game, dataminers quickly discovered what was about to happen and posted it all on social media. The stage was set. \r\n\n\r\nSo when the hand emerged, people knew what to do. That big box? It could be opened, if the chains around it were broken. And so players got to work. Some ignored Fortnite's normal battle royale rules completely, sticking instead to simply landing on the Island and shooting/pickaxing the chest's restraints, breaking them over the course of several hours, one-by-one. Others, predictably, decided to capitalise on all this by setting up camp nearby and sniping those trying to open the box. Debate raged about player etiquette - something which took me back to the outrage at people who wiped out upwards of 50-players at once as they settled in to watch Fortnite's first ever in-game event, the rocket launch, back in 2018. \r\n \nRead more",

Broadly, the studio says Temtem's early access demonstrated major new content didn't have a significant impact on the game's player base, making it difficult to justify the development resources required - although other issues, such as mounting technical debt, are also cited as concerns.\r\n\n\r\nAfter a lot of words, including some regret over having described the game as an \"MMO\" in its marketing material, Crema gets to the crux of its post: that it will release two more major updates for Temtem before development switches to more modest bug fixing and balance patches, as the studio's focus turns to new projects.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Balatro, the poker-themed rogue-like from solo developer LocalThunk that's been a huge critical and commercial hit since releasing last week, has been unexpectedly yanked from sale in some countries, with publisher Playstack blaming the issue on a surprise ratings change.\r\n\n\r\nPlaystack addressed the issue in a lengthy statement shared on social media, explaining Balatro's temporary removal from console stores had so far only happened \"some countries\". It admitted it could not \"estimate with complete confidence which stores\" had been impacted, adding, \"Our hope is that only a minority of stores will be affected\". It says it remains \"highly confident\" Balatro will remain available on PC, including Steam.\r\n\n\r\nThe cause of all this frustration is an unexpected \"overnight change\" to Balatro's age rating, which has been bumped from 3+ to 18+. According to Playstack, this change stems from an unspecified ratings board's \"mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Toys for Bob - the Activision Blizzard studio behind the likes of Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot 4, and the Spyro remasters - has announced it's parting ways with Activision to become an independent company once more. It also says it's \"exploring a possible partnership\" with Microsoft as development on its new game gets underway.\r\n\n\r\nToys for Bob, which was founded back in 1989, formed a publishing partnership with Activision in the 2000s that would lead to the studio's acquisition by the publisher in 2005. Toys for Bob has been part of Activision Blizzard ever since, initially working on the hugely popular toys-to-life Skylanders series before developing 2018 remaster Spyro Reignited Trilogy and 2020's well-received Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. Since then, it's served as a support studio for Call of Duty while also releasing last year's Crash Team Rumble.\r\n\n\r\nEarlier this month, following Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard and subsequent decision to lay off 1,900 workers across its Xbox teams, it was confirmed 86 Toys for Bob employees had lost their jobs. It was also reported the studio's physical office would be shutting down and that remaining staff would transition to working from home. And it's in this context that Toys for Bob has now announced it's splitting from Activision to go independent.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Following reports last year that Embracer Group was considering selling Borderlands studio Gearbox as part of its ongoing \"comprehensive restructuring programme\", it's now being claimed a sale to a third party is in the \"late stages\" of being finalised.\r\n\n\r\nThat's according to Kotaku, which says Gearbox CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford had previously told staff the studio was facing one of three possible scenarios: it would either stay with Embracer, be sold, or would finance a buyout and become independent once more. However, Pitchford reportedly shared an update with employees earlier this week, saying a decision had been made - and that decision, according to Kotaku's sources, was to sell.\r\n\n\r\nThe publication understands Gearbox's sale to an unnamed buyer is currently in the \"late stages of being finalised\", and while Embracer Group - which purchased Gearbox for $363m in 2021 - did not respond to Kotaku's requests for comment, Pitchford deflected the website's inquiries, saying, \"We will be thrilled to share whenever we have projects to announce or news to share as we work hard towards our mission to entertain the world.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Leap day is now upon us and a couple of games aren't happy about this sudden affront to their usual calendar expectations. Both EA Sports WRC and Theatrhythm Final Bar Line are currently protesting at the arrival of 29th February by refusing to function on consoles - but, luckily for rally fans and beat tappers, there's a pretty straightforward workaround.\r\n\n\r\nTheatrhythm Final Bar Line players noticed the Final Fantasy-themed PS4 and Switch rhythm game was failing to connect to Square Enix's servers after the clock struck midnight heralding the arrival 29th February, leaving it functionally unplayable.\r\n\n\r\nSimilarly, EA took to social media earlier today to acknowledge Codemasters' World Championship Rally was encountering an \"issue on console in which the game may crash on startup.\" And while it didn't explicitly blame the problem on today's leap year, the publisher's follow-up solution makes it clear 29th February is the culprit.\r\n \nRead more",

But the impact of crunch for that game's release and changes in the company's senior leadership have subsequently led to discontent within the studio, staff have told Eurogamer - something one source described as \"death by a thousand cuts\".\r\n\n\r\nMost concerning are reports from sources that two senior leaders from Sony support studio XDev, brought in to help lead Firesprite, have since been accused of sexual discrimination and ageism. A subsequent internal investigation by Sony is said to have resulted in the claims being dismissed as a \"misunderstanding\".\r\n \nRead more",

Following its roll-out across a number of other countries, Activision announced it would be getting its full release in autumn last year - but plans changed in October, when the publisher confirmed it had made the decision to postpone its launch to \"spring\" 2024 in order to \"polish up\" the experience.\r\n\n\r\nWith Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile's worldwide release now locked down to 21st March, Activision has started talking specifics, confirming the game will launch with two maps: Verdansk - which supports 120-player battle royale matches - and Rebirth Island, which supports 48-player battle royale matches using Gulag-free Resurgence rules.\r\n \nRead more",

What do we expect to see in the mysterious Z-A when it is fully revealed? And how many bad French-themed Pokémon ideas can we come up with?

          "description": "It's been over seven years since Limbo and Inside developer Playdead first began teasing its mysterious third project, and now - nearly five years since Eurogamer last has cause to write about a sneaky bit of concept art - the studio has shared a handful of new images, confirming (in case there was any doubt) the project is still alive and well.\r\n\n\r\nA first enigmatic bit of concept art for Playdead's untitled third game was shared by the developer in 2017, around six months after Inside launched to critical acclaim. At the time, the studio confirmed work was underway on its \"next adventure\", with the accompanying artwork pointing to a lonely adventure with sci-fi undertones.\r\n\n\r\nSince then, further bits of atmospheric concept art have sporadically surfaced - first on social media in 2018, then buried in some online job listings in 2019, then on LinkedIn last year - all seemingly pointing to an adventure in which a lone space traveller wanders a desolate planet strewn with abandoned tech. About all we've conclusively learned of the mysterious project in that time, again thanks to Playdead's jobs page, is that it's a \"third-person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe.\"\r\n \nRead more",
