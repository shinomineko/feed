Many expect cyber operations to provide independent utility in both warfare and low-intensity competition. Underlying these expectations are broadly shared assumptions that information technology increases operational effectiveness. But a growing body of research shows how cyber operations tend to fall short of their promise. The reason for this shortfall is their subversive mechanism of action. In theory, subversion provides a way to exert influence at lower risks than force because it is secret and indirect, exploiting systems to use them against adversaries. The mismatch between promise and practice is the consequence of the subversive trilemma of cyber operations, whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables. A case study of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict provides empirical support for the argument. Qualitative analysis leverages original data from field interviews, leaked documents, forensic evidence, and local media. Findings show that the subversive trilemma limited the strategic utility of all five major disruptive cyber operations in this conflict...</p></blockquote>",

You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don&#8217;t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>\n<p>This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE&#8217;s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government&#8217;s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has &#8212; without any judicial, legislative or public oversight &#8212; reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver&#8217;s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>",

Reportedly, this somewhat radical shift in focus for the series was to ensure a too-similar sequel didn't eat into the original mini-game compilation's ongoing sales.\r\n \nRead more",

It adds new enemies, fancy new building blocks and some odd new structures, left by past explorers. It's something fans have been wanting to dig into for some time.\r\n\n\r\nMojang originally announced Deep Dark almost two years ago, back at Minecraft Live in 2020. At the time, the biome was set to be part of the game's 2021 Caves and Cliffs Update (an offering that was further reshuffled after Caves and Cliffs was split in two). So, why the delay? What's been happening with Minecraft in the interim? And what's going on with that Jason Momoa Minecraft movie? I sat down with Minecraft's game director Agnes Larsson and gameplay developer Ulraf Vakninthe to find out more.\r\n\n\r\n\"We felt for a while 'this is a risk but we might be able to do it',\" Larsson told me, of Deep Dark's original intended release date. \"But then when we realised [we had to delay], we tried to take the decision really quickly because we would risk making people in the team very, very stressed out. And we also communicated about it really quickly because we wanted to be as transparent as possible about such a big decision. \r\n \nRead more",

A mysterious stranger named Rhi, who looks to be a new ally, has instead taken Willow's place while players investigate the emergence of the first Ultra Beasts. \r\n\n\r\nThese creatures are likely the cause of Willow's absence, and will hopefully be a continued focus over the game's new Season of Go. For now at least, Willow's absence appears to be a story development that will stick for some time, with standard in-game text changed throughout the app to remove references to the professor. (For those overly concerned, a Go Fest finale event for existing ticket holders, coming in August, seems likely to revolve around his revival.)\r\n \nRead more",

A lover of chaos, this majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses 'Lost Vegas' as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck.\"\r\n\n\r\nThe Twisted Metal series - a half-hour action comedy scripted by Cobra Kai writer Michael Jonathan Smith for Peacock - follows a motor-mouthed outsider, played by Anthony Mackie, who's offered a chance at a better life as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland dominated by savage marauders driving vehicles of destruction.\r\n \nRead more",

SoulCalibur for the OG Xbox has also been delisted, it was noted, although this seems to have happened some time ago. \r\n\nSoulCalibur 2 HD now shows a \"not available separately\" message when attempting to buy the game via the Microsoft Store's website - though it does not appear to be available elsewhere as part of any bundle - and \"not available at this time\" via Xbox consoles.\r\n \nRead more",

And he won't just be a static companion to add to your collection. Rather, he will have a head that can be \"tilted back, forward and sideways for maximum cuteness\".\nAs well as the ability to pose BD-1, those who purchase their own little droid companion this summer will also get to experience other neat little inclusions, such as the back of BD-1's head being translucent to show the droid's mood and a display sign (see below). He probably won't be able to heal you like he does for Cal, however. \n Read more",

          "description": "Ever since its unveiling in 2020, Dead Space creator Glen Schofield's sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol has conjured images of Dead Space, so it was a bit of a surprise when, due to various studio connections, it was announced the game would be set in the PUBG Universe. That, however, is no longer the case, with Schofield now saying it's its \"own story and world\".\r\n\n\r\nThe Callisto Protocol is a third-person horror game set in 2320, with its action unfolding within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter's moon Callisto. While that set-up mightn't immediately scream PUBG to onlookers, the connection came from the fact developer Striking Distance was explicitly established by PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton to create narrative-driven games that would expand the universe introduced in the battle royale hit.\r\n\n\r\nAs Schofield explained in a recent GameInformer cover feature on The Callisto Protocol, \"When we came in, [Krafton] had a lore team and they were writing this big story, like, 'Where does PUBG start? Where does it fit in?'\". Had those plans continued, the horror game would have sat \"pretty far out\" along the timeline, but somewhere during development the idea was dropped.\r\n \nRead more",

It also ushers in the highly anticipated Deep Dark biome, which was originally due to launch as part of the Caves & Cliffs update before getting delayed.\r\n\n\r\nThe Deep Dark biome, as its name very much implies, is Minecraft's deepest area to date, and is found beneath the game's current bedrock layer. Here, curious adventures will uncover remnants of a ruined civilisation as well as creepy, eyeless mobs known as Wardens. These fearsome foes react to vibrations, meaning stealth is the key to survival, and can also be summoned if careless explorers stumble into the new Shrieker traps.\r\n \nRead more",

However, getting your hands on absolutely everything that's released thus far is, inevitably, an extremely pricey undertaking even during sale season.\r\n\n\r\nHop over to the Humble Store right now though, and you can pick up publisher Paradox Interactive's Cities: Skylines Colossal Collection.

At the same time, a smaller team was working on its next-gen release, promised long before the project's launch woes, and an even smaller group was doing preliminary work on its paid expansion.\r\n\n\r\nInevitably, those numbers have shifted considerably over time - less than half of CD Projekt's development staff were working on Cyberpunk's base game and next-gen update by June last year, for instance - and that trend has, unsurprisingly, continued. As per today's financial results, Cyberpunk 2077 support has \"shrunk considerably\" following the release of its next-gen update (which CD Projekt says had \"a positive effect on the game's perception and sales figures\"), with the \"bulk of [the studio's] development capacity\" now working on its expansion.\r\n \nRead more",

Details are scarce at this juncture, but Funcom's roadmap makes reference to both co-op play and \"free-for-all\" PvP, with up to four players supported at one time.\r\n\n\r\nAlso due this summer is a brand-new faction, but specifics are even more limited in this case. All we're getting for the time being is the tease of a suitably mysterious silhouette and a note that the faction will include a \"new victory condition\".\r\n \nRead more",

And today's addition, titled Leviathan, is a very different proposition to April's The Blighted, and sounds considerably more ambitious - and significantly weirder - than any of the expeditions we've seen before. \nThat said, Leviathan begins in much the same way as previous expeditions, dropping all players into one location. However, what follows is something closer to a roguelike experience, stripping explorers of their progress whenever they die. The narrative twist, though, is that players are actually stuck in a mysterious time loop, and the entire community will need to work together to find a way to break free.\n Read more",

Crema has been steadily expanded the game's core creature-collecting and battling action since then - introducing the likes of new Temtem, new islands to explore, and new social and competitive features, not to mention launching an early access version for PS5 - and update 1.0 is now finally in sight.\r\n\n\r\nAfter more than two years in early access, Temtem is already pretty feature rich, with its pre-release version including the bulk of its story campaign across the Airborne Archipelago, well over 100 Temtem to catch, co-op play, competitive multiplayer, clans, housing, trading, and tournaments. However, its final release promises a number of new additions.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "After one hell of a long wait, the live-action Halo TV adaptation finally arrived earlier this year, and the response has been...mixed. And now Marcus Lehto, co-creator of the videogame series that started all, has shared his own thoughts on the adaptation, saying that while he doesn't \"hate\" it, he was ultimately \"confused by many of the choices that were made\".\r\n\n\r\nParamount+'s Halo adaptation finally launched for US audiences this March - a mere nine years after it was originally announced - and while changes were expected (fans were forewarned that the TV show takes place in the so-called Silver Timeline, separate from the core Halo canon), the end result has certainly proven divisive.\r\n\n\r\nWhile it was Master Chief's amusing loss of inhibitions that drew the most headlines over the series' run - just episodes after he'd stunned audiences by showing his face for the first time, he'd got his bum out, then ended the series having sex in front of his mum - there's been plenty of criticism around the show's writing, inconsistent tone, uneven plotting, and pacing.\r\n \nRead more",

The big gambit this year, if you're unaware, is an ongoing, season-spanning narrative that will progress across monthly in-game story episodes known as Adventures.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a promising idea that so far doesn't really seem to have found its footing, with Seas of Thieves' initial set of Adventures having felt decidedly undercooked, both in terms of their challenges and narrative presentation.

          "description": "This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we're talking PlayStation Plus Premium, and our thoughts on whether it's worth the price based on what we know so far. \r\n\nThe thing is, there are still several questions about what it will provide - even now, less than a week away from its initial rollout in Asia. What is its full game list? How good will its streaming be? And how soon should we expect newer games like Ratchet & Clank and Horizon Forbidden West to turn up on the service? \nThe biggest difference between PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass is, of course, the lack of big new first-party games launching into Plus on day one. But, with Starfield's delay to 2023, Microsoft might not have any on Game Pass this year either. How will Xbox counter? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.\r\n \nRead more",

As you would expect, it looked bombastic and eclectic, with a myriad of unusual ideas that can only really be married together in a Saints Row game.\nHowever, at this point, it also felt like Volition has focused a bit too much on adding in all this \"stuff\" to the game, and seemingly at the cost of some polish and finesse. Saints Row was confirmed to be a cross-gen release on its initial announcement last year, and that seems to be a fair market for it. Right now, it just looks and feels like more of a last-gen game than a current one.\nThroughout the showcase, Saints Row's fighting appeared to be a touch clunky, while its cutscenes and dialogue felt more forced than we may expect from a game today. Meanwhile, during a close up of the Boss' face, you could clearly see that the character's eyelashes and eyelids did not match up in the way you would expect them to. This could be a bug that will be fixed by launch, but it was nonetheless jarring on the eye (mine, not the Boss', although their eye did look jarred as well).\n Read more",

Here's a trailer showing gameplay:\n Read more",

Its block-busting gameplay was married with a slamming soundtrack that made it an ideal way to pass some time while waiting for the release of Fast and Furious and other classics of that year. However, if you didn't have the chance to bop along with this sci-fi puzzler then, now is your chance. \nYes, that's right, the game is getting remastered. And, not only that, it is also coming to even more consoles than before. In \"late 2022\", you will be able to play Shatter Remastered Deluxe on Windows and Mac for PC (via Steam), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. You are, quite simply, spoiled for choice. \nYou can check out the announcement trailer for Shatter Remastered Deluxe below.\n Read more",

It also proved to be an ingenious puzzler beneath all that - tasking players with manipulating portals to navigate increasingly devious challenges - and one that still holds up wonderfully today.\r\n\n\r\nThe currently in-development Portal demake, officially known as Portal 64, is the work of developer James Lambert, and is ambitiously attempting to pack the entire experience of Valve's classic - memes, portals, puzzles, and all - down onto Nintendo hardware that preceded its release by over a decade.\r\n \nRead more",

It's being called a new standalone \"platform\" for the series, consisting of several key parts; there's a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.\r\n\n\r\nReforger's sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia's previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer's latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.\r\n \nRead more",

It looks like it's set to come to Xbox and PlayStation consoles, too, although the wording is a tad confusing, so it's possible the PS4 and PS5 release will come \"in the future\".\r\n\nThe leak intimates that the company is set to announce Arma 4 alongside Reforger, which has been called a \"more focused\" title that will \"introduce Arma to a new console-oriented audience\" with a \"very strong multiplayer focus\" that will \"test new technology and design decisions to form the foundation for Arma 4.\"\r\n \nRead more",

But while all was quiet on the Alan front for over a decade, he's had something of a resurgence in recent times.\r\n\n\r\nAlongside a prominent role in Remedy's acclaimed Control - specifically in its second DLC, known as AWE - Alan Wake was given the remaster treatment in 2021 (a release now confirmed for Switch) and will be getting a long-awaited sequel some time next year. As such, a TV series expanding Alan's reach still further seems like the next logical step for Remedy.\r\n \nRead more",

(It will also, of course, save the hefty sum it paid for those four letters on the front of its box.) As for FIFA, it has said its brand is the thing that matters, and it'll be fine without EA. Indeed, to quote FIFA president Gianni Infantino, \"the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST\". So there's that.\nBut behind all the bluster, what do we think EA Sports FC will really look like in future?

Well, they have done it again, and this time discovered the zebra that Abby and her father take care of in Salt Lake City is actually invincible (for which I am quite relieved - this game has enough bloodshed as it is).\nIn the second episode of Speclizer's myth busting series, the creator used a series of gunshots and explosives to see if the zebra would meet its demise. However, that lady is a hardy one, and if anything, she only looks mildly disgruntled as the bomb blasts go off around her (which, you know, seems fair).\nAnother amusing discovery comes from the snowy streets of Jackson. This time, it is Ellie in the control seat, and she is pissed at the community's annoying kids for trying to best her in a snowball fight. However, no matter how far Ellie goes from that play area, she will still be hit over and over again by the white stuff. In the words of Speclizer, \"the kids have aimbot\".\n Read more",

          "description": "Following EA's announcement that it will be ditching the FIFA brand and renaming its long-running football series EA Sports FC starting in 2023, FIFA President Gianni Infantino has responded, insisting, \"the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans.\"\r\n\n\r\nThat comes alongside FIFA's announcement it'll be adopting a non-exclusive licensing model for games based on its brand moving forward, and that it's currently working with third-party studios and publishers to developer new projects. This, it says, will enable it to provide \"more choice for football and gaming fans in the lead-up to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and FIFA Women's World Cup Australia & New Zealand 2023.\"\r\n\n\r\nNow that its partnership with EA is officially over, FIFA says it's already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024. Before that, however, it'll be launching a number of \"non-simulation games\" with the initial selection due to release in the third quarter of this year.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Grounded, developer Obsidian's inch-high garden survival adventure, has just dropped another update on the road to its Version 1.0 release later this year, introducing what sounds like a sort of on-demand horde mode for players wishing to farm and battle particular enemies.\r\n\n\r\nAs explained in a new developer video, the idea behind Grounded's Bugs Strike Back update is to introduce - in \"true Obsidian fashion\" - Faction Reactivity. Essentially, the more players bother specific bug types in their quest for new materials - whether that be by killing them outright or merely invading their territory - the more likely those creatures will be to storm player bases to try and exact revenge.\r\n\n\r\nWhile that'll happen automatically during play, those looking for a more on-demand-style experience can take advantage of two additional features. There's the new Waft Emitter device that enables players to summon specific bug types to a location for some wave-based mayhem by jamming in parts stolen from their downed brethren. The more parts used, the more intense the ensuing battle will be so players are recommended to proceed cautiously.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Nintendo's decision not to bring cult classic Mother 3 to the west was purely \"business\", former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has said. \r\n\n\r\nThe latest comment on the matter - and the latest interview with Fils-Aimé as he promotes his new memoir - comes from Bloomberg, where the former exec stated for the first time that Mother 3's content was not the issue.\r\n\n\r\n\"That is not at all the issue why Mother 3 in particular never made it to the West,\" Fils-Aime said when asked about Mother 3's more sensitive topics. \"It was all based on the business needs and the business situation at the time.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You know the feeling where you see something, and you know you've seen it somewhere before but can't quite put your finger on where - and then it suddenly hits you and it all makes sense? Well, that's what happened to the developers of Final Fantasy 16, when Bloodborne was first released. They pretty much had the exact same idea themselves, they say, but their game was cancelled before we got to hear about it. \r\n\nWriting in Japanese magazine Famitsu, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida detailed what could have been (via ResetEra). \r\n\nYoshida and fellow Final Fantasy team members Hiroshi Takai and Hiroshi Minagawa reminisced about their previous game that was \"basically Bloodborne\", but before Bloodborne was even a thing.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse (which manages all of miHoYo's global operations outside of China) has teased its upcoming game, Zenless Zone Zero.\nThe game's site is now live and shows a digital clock perched atop a retro TV. Meanwhile, off to one side, there is a calendar couting down to 13th May. More interestingly (and also more strangely), the dials on the TV can actually be twiddled by clicking on them and, when done so, one of two videos will start playing.\nThe first video is mostly static with a few blurry and erratic shots thrown in here and there. Throughout, an unknown man chats a lot about \"Doomsday\" and states, \"in short, we're being reborn... and you're involved.\" If that doesn't make a lot of sense to you right now, don't worry. It doesn't to us either. \n Read more",
