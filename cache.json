Most Kremlin-backed groups take pains to fly under the radar; Gamaredon doesn&#8217;t care to.

(SMS conversations lack any reliable method for verification­&#8212;sorry, green-bubble friends.) Instead of relying on Apple to verify the other person’s identity using information stored securely on Apple’s servers, you and the other party read a short verification code to each other, either in person or on a phone call. Once you’ve validated the conversation, your devices maintain a chain of trust in which neither you nor the other person has given any private encryption information to each other or Apple. If anything changes in the encryption keys each of you verified, the Messages app will notice and provide an alert or warning...</p></blockquote>",

Since then, the team has wrapped up work on two final DLC drops introducing new characters, islands, and more - but it turns out that wasn't quite everything it had in store: in a surprise final update, Mimimi has now launched an expansive \"modding tool\" for PC.\r\n\n\r\nShadow Gambit launched back in August, and saw Mimimi revisiting its beloved stealth-tactics genre - which it'd already bought to life with impressive flair in Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperatdos 3 - with an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. The result, as I wrote in my four star review was a blend of \"raucous, high seas adventure and cerebral, slow-paced stealth\" that proved to be a \"joyous mastery of a very particular form\".\r\n\n\r\nShortly after its release, Mimimi announced Shadow Gambit would be the studio's last project, as its \"increasingly ambitious games\" had taken a \"heavy personal toll on us and our families\". Two final DLC releases for Shadow Gambit were to bring the studio's activities to a close, but it's now surprised fans with a \"very final parting gift\": an expansive \"modding tool\" designed to enable players to create their own custom mods.\r\n \nRead more",

And while this year's Game Awards failed to make the interminable wait any easier with a first trailer or some small morsel of news for fans, we might finally have something resembling a potential release window - courtesy of a retailer leak, by way of an official Bandai Namco partner, pointing to a February 2024 launch for the DLC.\r\n\n\r\nAs spotted over on Reddit, details of a new Elden Ring collaboration between publisher Bandai Namco and peripheral manufacturer Thrustmaster - one that'll apparently see the latter release a series of limited edition controllers themed around the game - were today shared, briefly and presumably mistakenly, by online retailer Datablitz.\r\n\n\r\nNotably, the accompanying promotional material revealed the first batch of controllers would arrive in February next year to \"sync with the new Shadow of the Erdtree expansion release\". It's a launch window that seems highly unlikely at first glance, not least because it's barely two months from now with no peep of marketing from Bandai Namco - but on the other hand, who's to say that if I wish for something hard enough I can't make it happen? Plus, a surprise second anniversary launch would be in keeping with the amusingly understated way the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was announced in the first place.\r\n \nRead more",

Enter developer Zeekerss, which has now taken its own delightfully literal approach to solving the ongoing spider problem in its smash-hit co-op horror Lethal Company.\r\n\n\r\nLethal Company - which has proven to be an unexpectedly huge success since launching into early access in October, remaining high on Steam's top-selling and most played charts - runs the gamut of horrors, pitting players against everything from ghost girls and mechanical bees to eyeless dogs and spring-loaded mannequins as they scavenge its moon bases.\r\n\n\r\nBut as of this week's Frosty Update, players will no longer be forced to recoil in horror as its scuttling bunker spiders do their rounds. In perhaps the simplest, most effective attempt yet at making a game less of an ordeal for those with an aversion to eight-legged creatures, Zeekerss has introduced an arachnophobia mode that swaps out their scuttling heft for the word \"spider\", comically overlaid where the critter in question should be.\r\n \nRead more",

It's got cultists, a metal soundtrack, three campaign episodes, and a varied arsenal ranging from shotguns to crossbows and swords. It is a good time!\r\n\n\r\nAnd now, five years after its release, Dusk is ready to careen into the modern era (assuming that modern era is circa the early 2000s) with an HD remaster that features remade assets for all existing visual elements - including enemy and weapon models - alongside a few new ones.\r\n \nRead more",

You also have a limited ability to jump - sending your vehicle soaring vertically upwards to higher portions of track or over barriers and through waterfalls to secret shortcuts. \r\n \nRead more",

This one sees Travellers teaming up to rebuild an abandoned solar system for the mysterious Utopia Foundation, with rewards including the Fearsome Visor helmet, a new robotic drone companion, plus a new ship type known as the Utopia Speeder. Hello Games will be giving players another chance to tackle Utopia starting today, 8th December, until 15h December.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Payday 3 might've failed to wow, but there's reason for heist fans to remain cheerful: GTFO studio 10 Chamber - which was co-founded by Payday 1 and 2 veterans including designer Ulf Andersson - has announced Den of Wolves, a sci-fi take on the Payday formula.\r\n\n\r\nDen of Wolves (which was teased back in August) got its formal unveiling at this year's The Game Awards via an enigmatic reveal trailer, but I had the opportunity to spent some time with 10 Chambers co-founder and narrative director Simon Viklund ahead of the show, to learn a little more about the studio's plans for the project.\r\n\n\r\nWith development on 10 Chambers' debut game, acclaimed hardcore sci-fi shooter GTFO, formally at an end with the release of today's The Final Chapter update, the studio's focus is now on to Den of Wolves, which Viklund describes as a continuation and evolution of the mechanics seen in Payday: The Heist and Payday 2. It's a project that came about because the team felt there was still \"untapped potential in the heist genre\" - and because it was desperately keen to escape the oppressive squalor of GTFO's corridors for airier climes.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Development on 10 Chambers' rock-hard co-op horror shooter GTFO is officially coming to an end today after three years of robust post-launch support with one last update, the appropriately titled The Final Chapter.\r\n\n\r\nGTFO - which sends teams of up to four players on regular expeditions deep into the bowels of a vast underground complex overrun by terrifying creatures - got its version 1.0 release back in December 2019 after two years of early access. It's essentially been run as a live-service-style title since then (albeit without any live-service-style monetisation), adding a succession of time-limited story missions, maps, and other content.\r\n\n\r\n10 Chambers announced a change in its update strategy last December that would see it reinstate all Rundowns (as the limited-time events were known) so that players have permanent access to all previous story content - equating to over 80 expeditions - and today's Final Chapter update means GTFO now officially has a beginning, middle, and end.\r\n \nRead more",

Sure the game is several years old now, but it is still very popular with players, so why not give the game a boost if it needs it.\n\r\nHowever, this particular update has gone down rather badly with Skyrimmers, as it has reintroduced a paid mod platform into the game. \nTo get you up to speed as to why this has been controversial, all the way back in 2015, Bethesda partnered with Valve to bring paid mods to Skyrim via Steam. However, it was incredibly unpopular with both players and mod makers, and the publisher removed the option to sell Skyrim mods on Valve's platform shortly after this idea made its debut. \n Read more",

Safer Seas enables up to four friends to crew a ship across a private version of the world and access all PvE content - ranging from emergent events to Trading Company quests and narrative-driven Tall Tales - without needing to deal with other crews.\r\n\n\r\nIt is, then, pretty much exactly what people have been asking for since Sea of Thieves' launch back in 2018, albeit with a number of restrictions. Features including Guilds, Hourglass Factions, and live-service events such as Gold & Glory are all unavailable, and Rare is capping Trading Company progression at 40 in Safer Seas, meaning it won't be possible to reach Pirate Legend status without returning to High Seas mode. Additionally, gold or reputation for Athena's Fortune or their Reaper's Bones counterpart won't be earnable.\r\n \nRead more",

Three years later though, CD Projekt has announced it's restoring the long-missing rideable metro system in a surprise 2.1 update arriving next Tuesday, 5th December.\r\n\n\r\nThe 2.1 update coincides with the launch of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition (bundling together the base game and Phantom Liberty expansion) and was detailed in a new developer livestream, beginning with that long-awaited Metro system. \"The metro was not in our plans for a long time,\" producer Monika Janowska explained during the presentation. \"However, over time we've revisited our plan and... decided that it actually could be achievable.\"\r\n\n\r\nNight City's metro system, officially known as Night City Area Rapid Transit and described as an \"immersive way to travel through the world\", consists of five lines spanning 19 stations. It unlocks after Cyberpunk's Konpeki Plaza sequence relatively early on and can either be used as fast travel locations (as was the case prior to 2.1) or \"as a proper metro ride experience\" for those who'd like to take in the sights in a more leisurely fashion.\r\n \nRead more",

It doesn't mean the game has suddenly gone first-person, but it does mean optional - and fluidly interchangeable - WASD movement is coming to the series for the first time. And that you can now move slightly while attacking. \nThe Mercenary revolves around the crossbow weapon they carry, which behaves - depending on the type of crossbow - like either a shotgun, an assault rifle, or a sniper rifle. You can carry two kinds of crossbow at the same time. \nWhat your crossbow does also depends heavily on the kind of ammo you're using. If you're using incendiary ammo, for instance, your assault rifle crossbow will spin-up like a mini-gun and be devastating - and fiery - once revved up. Meanwhile, your sniper crossbow with incendiary ammo will behave more like a rocket launcher, exploding on impact. Frost ammo, meanwhile, freezes enemies and also creates varying kinds of frost effects - or ice walls - on the floor depending on which crossbow you use. Oh, and there's a grenade-launcher attachment too, because why not? And again, there are varying types of grenade you can fire.\n Read more",

The update will include a fix for performance issues in Act 3, Astarion's kisses, and more. \nSince Patch 4 was released at the beginning of the month, Baldur's Gate 3 players have experienced slowdown in Act 3. The performance issues were introduced in the patch, Larian stated on X (née Twitter), and resulted in tag crimes like theft and violence being tagged as \"eternally-active\", regardless of whether or not players were spotted by NPCs.\nLarian director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the slowdown is caused by a specific bug in Moonrise Towers during Act 2. Patch 5 will address this and \"so much more,\" Douse wrote, when it hopefully drops later this week. Mostly I'm just looking forward to being able to ask Astarion for a kiss and actually receive one.\n Read more",

The game looks packed with drama, family, violence, and the supernatural. LLL was announced a few months later in November 2022 and is a sci-fi MMO set in an alternate history which caused modern-day Seoul, the Byzantine Empire and the 23rd century to become entangled with one another.\nThe trailer for Project M gives us a look at a new environment, a brightly lit but dilapidated theme park. There's also some stealth and action sections which aren't driven by quicktime events, so there'll be some variety in the game's combat. \n Read more",

          "description": "Back in August, as part of this year's TennoCon celebrations, Warframe developer Digital Extremes unveiled Whispers in the Walls, the next (and extremely weird) chapter in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter's ongoing saga. And as its new confirmed December launch window approaches, the studio has shared a heap of new information on what to expect come the expansion's release, including confirmation it'll arrive alongside cross-save support.\r\n\n\r\nWhispers in the Walls introduces new mission types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set. It's an expansion primarily focused on the long-hidden laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos, and one that'll reveal the \"proverbial big bang\" that kicked off every event in Warframe.\r\n\n\r\nIn terms of enemies, the labyrinthine laboratory plays host to a much-expanded Necramech faction, including new Necrodogs, that players can battle using Whispers in the Walls' new Grimoire, a secondary weapon capable of flinging pages of devastating Void. But that's not the expansion's only new threat; at certain points, players will find themselves whisked away from the gothic gloom of Albrecht's lab to a vast Eldritch desert that serves as the home of the mysterious Man in the Wall. Here, they'll encounter a second new faction, the Murmur, nightmarish multi-limbed creatures resembling tech-infused biblical angels.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Super Mario RPG's recently released Switch remake is a lovely thing, freshening up a much-loved classic for a new generation, while ensuring its core remains faithful enough that it can deliver a wonderful blast of nostalgia for long-time fans. And it turns out that faithfulness runs deep, with players having discovered it restores a fun little easter egg that was cut from the original version during the localisation process for release outside of Japan.\r\n\n\r\nMore specifically, the 1996 Japanese version of Super Mario RPG contained a cute - if ultimately fairly pointless - sequence that would trigger if players entered the cheat code 'Down, Up, Right, Left, L, R, L, R, B' on the pause screen.\r\n\n\r\nRather than showering players with treats to make the experience a little easier or give everyone a massive head, as cheat codes tended to do at the time, entering Super Mario RPG's sequence of button presses would instead cause Toad to materialise and ponder what the secret code you just entered could possibly have done.\r\n \nRead more",
