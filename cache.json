After years of relative silence on its progress, studio co-head Neil Druckmann emerged in January to confirm more would be revealed \"later this year\" - but instead, May brought the news the project needed \"more time\".\r\n\n\r\nShortly after, a report from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claimed Destiny developer Bungie - which had been individually assessing many of Sony's \"games as a service\" projects since being acquired by the company - had raised concerns about The Last of Us multiplayer's \"ability to keep players engaged for a long period of time\", resulting in Sony scaling back the team to just a \"small group\" while it evaluated the project's direction.\r\n \nRead more",

Enter developer Zeekerss, which has now taken its own delightfully literal approach to solving the ongoing spider problem in its smash-hit co-op horror Lethal Company.\r\n\n\r\nLethal Company - which has proven to be an unexpectedly huge success since launching into early access in October, remaining high on Steam's top-selling and most played charts - runs the gamut of horrors, pitting players against everything from ghost girls and mechanical bees to eyeless dogs and spring-loaded mannequins as they scavenge its moon bases.\r\n\n\r\nBut as of this week's Frosty Update, players will no longer be forced to recoil in horror as its scuttling bunker spiders do their rounds. In perhaps the simplest, most effective attempt yet at making a game less of an ordeal for those with an aversion to eight-legged creatures, Zeekerss has introduced an arachnophobia mode that swaps out their scuttling heft for the word \"spider\", comically overlaid where the critter in question should be.\r\n \nRead more",

It's got cultists, a metal soundtrack, three campaign episodes, and a varied arsenal ranging from shotguns to crossbows and swords. It is a good time!\r\n\n\r\nAnd now, five years after its release, Dusk is ready to careen into the modern era (assuming that modern era is circa the early 2000s) with an HD remaster that features remade assets for all existing visual elements - including enemy and weapon models - alongside a few new ones.\r\n \nRead more",

The two platform-holders swiftly retaliated by pulling the game from their storefronts. Epic subsequently filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google, accusing both companies of anti-competitive behaviour and market monopolisation.\nThe case against Apple was settled by a court judge in September 2021 in favour of Apple on nine of 10 counts, and earlier this year the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulings after appeals from both parties. Epic's case against Google has had a dramatically different result, with the jury deciding in favour of Epic on all counts.\n Read more",

It's called Pony Island 2: Panda Circus and is coming Steam at some currently undisclosed future point.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Pony Island - a genre-shifting delve into a demonically possessed arcade cabinet - was emphatically not about ponies (well, not exactly), and its sequel promises to continue that tradition, offering a \"phantasmagorical voyage through time, myth, divinity, and video game\".\r\n\n\r\nThis time around, you're cast as a young nomad doomed to live out their untimely death within The Earth Prison. The goal, explains Mullins over on Pony Island 2's newly revealed Steam page, is to \"escape the lordly deities of the underworld with your soul, and your sanity, intact.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Safer Seas enables up to four friends to crew a ship across a private version of the world and access all PvE content - ranging from emergent events to Trading Company quests and narrative-driven Tall Tales - without needing to deal with other crews.\r\n\n\r\nIt is, then, pretty much exactly what people have been asking for since Sea of Thieves' launch back in 2018, albeit with a number of restrictions. Features including Guilds, Hourglass Factions, and live-service events such as Gold & Glory are all unavailable, and Rare is capping Trading Company progression at 40 in Safer Seas, meaning it won't be possible to reach Pirate Legend status without returning to High Seas mode. Additionally, gold or reputation for Athena's Fortune or their Reaper's Bones counterpart won't be earnable.\r\n \nRead more",

It unlocks after Cyberpunk's Konpeki Plaza sequence relatively early on and can either be used as fast travel locations (as was the case prior to 2.1) or \"as a proper metro ride experience\" for those who'd like to take in the sights in a more leisurely fashion.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Mercenary class has been unveiled for Path of Exile 2, and notably, it brings a whole new style of play to the game: shooter gameplay. It doesn't mean the game has suddenly gone first-person, but it does mean optional - and fluidly interchangeable - WASD movement is coming to the series for the first time. And that you can now move slightly while attacking. \nThe Mercenary revolves around the crossbow weapon they carry, which behaves - depending on the type of crossbow - like either a shotgun, an assault rifle, or a sniper rifle. You can carry two kinds of crossbow at the same time. \nWhat your crossbow does also depends heavily on the kind of ammo you're using. If you're using incendiary ammo, for instance, your assault rifle crossbow will spin-up like a mini-gun and be devastating - and fiery - once revved up. Meanwhile, your sniper crossbow with incendiary ammo will behave more like a rocket launcher, exploding on impact. Frost ammo, meanwhile, freezes enemies and also creates varying kinds of frost effects - or ice walls - on the floor depending on which crossbow you use. Oh, and there's a grenade-launcher attachment too, because why not? And again, there are varying types of grenade you can fire.\n Read more",

It then prematurely resurfaced on Steam today, getting a little ahead of Capcom's latest Dragon's Dogma 2 showcase where it was finally made official.\r\n\n\r\nAnd official it now is, with Dragon's Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirming the news during a 15-minute livestream that also featured a lengthy new trailer. Tucked in there was an appearance from the previously unseen Talos, a truly colossal armoured soldier striding forth from the depths of the ocean that Capcom seems particularly proud of - so much so that we got an extended look at the fight once the trailer was over.\r\n \nRead more",

And as its new confirmed December launch window approaches, the studio has shared a heap of new information on what to expect come the expansion's release, including confirmation it'll arrive alongside cross-save support.\r\n\n\r\nWhispers in the Walls introduces new mission types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set. It's an expansion primarily focused on the long-hidden laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos, and one that'll reveal the \"proverbial big bang\" that kicked off every event in Warframe.\r\n\n\r\nIn terms of enemies, the labyrinthine laboratory plays host to a much-expanded Necramech faction, including new Necrodogs, that players can battle using Whispers in the Walls' new Grimoire, a secondary weapon capable of flinging pages of devastating Void. But that's not the expansion's only new threat; at certain points, players will find themselves whisked away from the gothic gloom of Albrecht's lab to a vast Eldritch desert that serves as the home of the mysterious Man in the Wall. Here, they'll encounter a second new faction, the Murmur, nightmarish multi-limbed creatures resembling tech-infused biblical angels.\r\n \nRead more",

And it turns out that faithfulness runs deep, with players having discovered it restores a fun little easter egg that was cut from the original version during the localisation process for release outside of Japan.\r\n\n\r\nMore specifically, the 1996 Japanese version of Super Mario RPG contained a cute - if ultimately fairly pointless - sequence that would trigger if players entered the cheat code 'Down, Up, Right, Left, L, R, L, R, B' on the pause screen.\r\n\n\r\nRather than showering players with treats to make the experience a little easier or give everyone a massive head, as cheat codes tended to do at the time, entering Super Mario RPG's sequence of button presses would instead cause Toad to materialise and ponder what the secret code you just entered could possibly have done.\r\n \nRead more",

Being a PvPvE experience, the threats outside are twofold: there're the zombies - which can't be killed, meaning stealth is key to survival - alongside other human scavengers, who'll either need to be avoided or set upon with makeshift weaponry (firearms are a scare commodity).\r\n\n\r\nPlayers can come and go as they like, meaning once they're satisfied with their haul, they can return to the safe zone, where Nakwon's more simulation-focused activities occur. Here, hard-gained resources can be sold for money, which is used to increase Citizen Grades and secure better priveliges and benefits. \"Every day, you must decide whether to go out for Scouting or staying inside,\" Mintrocket explained previously. \"But, you must consistently secure more food to avoid starvation and make the best choice whenever an unexpected event occurs.\"\r\n \nRead more",

The two platform-holders swiftly retaliated by pulling the game from their storefronts. Epic subsequently filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google, and the case against Apple was settled in September 2021 in favour of Apple on nine of 10 counts. Earlier this year, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulings after appeals from both parties.\nNow Epic is back in court to wage its case against Google. While the court battle between Epic and Apple brought us the bizarre moment in which banana mascot Peely's decency was questioned in (apologies, in the tuxedo he's known as Agent Peely), so far the proceedings with Google have been revealing in a slightly different way.\n Read more",

          "description": "Epic Games has promised fixes to remedy early issues with Fortnite's newly introduced age ratings system, which has left players frustrated after many popular cosmetics have become unusable in certain parts of the game in order to meet ratings requirements.\r\n\n\r\nLast month bought the news Epic would be introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it called its evolution into a \"multi-game ecosystem\". Epic is, of course, currently trying to expand the reach of Fortnite by placing a greater focus on Roblox-style user-generated experiences build using its recently released Creative 2.0 tools - and the game's latest update means all these experiences now come with age ratings, starting at E for Everyone and going through E10+ up to Teen.\r\n\n\r\nSo far, so sensible. The problem is the seemingly haphazard way all this has been implemented in a game that has, up until now, been exclusively rated Teen. Essentially, as of Fortnite's latest update, every single bit of content, including all cosmetics, has been given its own age rating - and players are being prevented from accessing Creative mode experiences if they're wearing anything flagged as age-inappropriate. It doesn't help either, that seemingly benign cosmetics skins - a muscular cartoon cat, for instance - are rated Teen-only and considered unsuitable for children, while others, such as Halloween's Michael Myers are rated a-okay for the young 'uns.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Developer Aspyr Media has claimed the free cut content DLC it planned to release for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 on Switch was cancelled after objections from a \"third-party\".\r\n\n\r\nThat's according to Axios, which reports Aspyr made the claim as part of an ongoing lawsuit relating to the DLC's failure to release, which was filed by a Malachi Mickelonis earlier this year. Mickelonis argues Aspyr and publisher Saber Interactive violated California consumer law by cancelling the DLC, and intentionally deceived purchasers \"in order to artificially raise sales revenues...based on qualities and features that the game simply did not possess\".\r\n\n\r\nAspyr announced it was cancelling Knights of the Old Republic 2's Restored Content DLC for Switch - which was to have been based on a popular PC fan mod built from unused story content found in the original game's code - back in June, but did not offer an explanation at the time. Now, however, court documents reviewed by Axios quote Aspyr co-CEO Ted Saloch as saying the company \"believed it would be able to release the content, but a third party objected and Aspyr was unable to do so.\"\r\n \nRead more",

It then went on to address the reception Payday 3 has since received. \r\n\n\r\nAs previously reported, the game was plagued with matchmaking issues at launch and online-only requirements.
