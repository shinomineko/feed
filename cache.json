No passcode fallback is available in the event that the user is unable to complete Face ID or Touch ID authentication.</p>\n<p>For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple said there will be no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work...</p></blockquote>",

When Baldur's Gate 3 was still in early access, forum user Solfalia messaged Larian to thank the studio for releasing Act I, despite the game not being complete. This release allowed Solfalia to play the game - as it was at the time - with their father, who had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Their father had played other Larian games in the past and was a fan, so this opportunity meant a lot to them both.\r\n\n\r\n\"This Early Access means that this Xmas I'll be able to go on an adventure with him one last time, and I know he'll enjoy it,\" Solfalia wrote in their original post from 2020.\r\n \nRead more",

The Redditor recorded \"some naked camp time fun\", which they planned to share with their brother. Xbox then automatically uploaded the footage to its servers. \r\n\n\r\nHowever, if Xbox discovers imagery it deems offensive, the content is removed and the player's profile will be \"temporarily prohibited from sharing additional imagery (typically for 24 hours)\". And, as Daddy-Vegas' clips included that aforementioned nudity, they were met with a ban for each clip, which resulted in their account being suspended for a year. They have since appealed their ban, with the Redditor revealing earlier this week their efforts were successful.\r\n \nRead more",

This follows the conclusion of a legal dispute with publisher Nacon, in which Frogwares accused the company of claiming copyright of The Sinking City after its release, withholding milestone payments, and owing the developer unpaid royalties.\r\n\n\r\nThe dispute between the two companies saw Frogwares attempting to remove The Sinking City from PC storefront Steam in a bid to sever its ties to Nacon. In February 2021, Frogwares then told people not to buy its game from Steam and the following month it issued The Sinking City with a DMCA takedown. At this time, it claimed Nacon had \"illegally\" uploaded a hacked version to Valve's platform.\r\n\n\r\nNow, Frogwares is the sole publisher of The Sinking City across all platforms. In a post appropriately shared on Steam, the studio said it was \"happy to put this whole thing behind\" it, and is now looking forward to \"sharing more news about the future of the franchise down the line\".\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, the team has wrapped up work on two final DLC drops introducing new characters, islands, and more - but it turns out that wasn't quite everything it had in store: in a surprise final update, Mimimi has now launched an expansive \"modding tool\" for PC.\r\n\n\r\nShadow Gambit launched back in August, and saw Mimimi revisiting its beloved stealth-tactics genre - which it'd already bought to life with impressive flair in Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperatdos 3 - with an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. The result, as I wrote in my four star review was a blend of \"raucous, high seas adventure and cerebral, slow-paced stealth\" that proved to be a \"joyous mastery of a very particular form\".\r\n\n\r\nShortly after its release, Mimimi announced Shadow Gambit would be the studio's last project, as its \"increasingly ambitious games\" had taken a \"heavy personal toll on us and our families\". Two final DLC releases for Shadow Gambit were to bring the studio's activities to a close, but it's now surprised fans with a \"very final parting gift\": an expansive \"modding tool\" designed to enable players to create their own custom mods.\r\n \nRead more",

And while this year's Game Awards failed to make the interminable wait any easier with a first trailer or some small morsel of news for fans, we might finally have something resembling a potential release window - courtesy of a retailer leak, by way of an official Bandai Namco partner, pointing to a February 2024 launch for the DLC.\r\n\n\r\nAs spotted over on Reddit, details of a new Elden Ring collaboration between publisher Bandai Namco and peripheral manufacturer Thrustmaster - one that'll apparently see the latter release a series of limited edition controllers themed around the game - were today shared, briefly and presumably mistakenly, by online retailer Datablitz.\r\n\n\r\nNotably, the accompanying promotional material revealed the first batch of controllers would arrive in February next year to \"sync with the new Shadow of the Erdtree expansion release\". It's a launch window that seems highly unlikely at first glance, not least because it's barely two months from now with no peep of marketing from Bandai Namco - but on the other hand, who's to say that if I wish for something hard enough I can't make it happen? Plus, a surprise second anniversary launch would be in keeping with the amusingly understated way the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was announced in the first place.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Video games love spiders but arachnophobes obviously don't, and we've seen an increasing number of studios attempting to find a comfortable middle ground - usually an adorable, blobby middle ground - for all involved in recent times. Enter developer Zeekerss, which has now taken its own delightfully literal approach to solving the ongoing spider problem in its smash-hit co-op horror Lethal Company.\r\n\n\r\nLethal Company - which has proven to be an unexpectedly huge success since launching into early access in October, remaining high on Steam's top-selling and most played charts - runs the gamut of horrors, pitting players against everything from ghost girls and mechanical bees to eyeless dogs and spring-loaded mannequins as they scavenge its moon bases.\r\n\n\r\nBut as of this week's Frosty Update, players will no longer be forced to recoil in horror as its scuttling bunker spiders do their rounds. In perhaps the simplest, most effective attempt yet at making a game less of an ordeal for those with an aversion to eight-legged creatures, Zeekerss has introduced an arachnophobia mode that swaps out their scuttling heft for the word \"spider\", comically overlaid where the critter in question should be.\r\n \nRead more",

It's got cultists, a metal soundtrack, three campaign episodes, and a varied arsenal ranging from shotguns to crossbows and swords. It is a good time!\r\n\n\r\nAnd now, five years after its release, Dusk is ready to careen into the modern era (assuming that modern era is circa the early 2000s) with an HD remaster that features remade assets for all existing visual elements - including enemy and weapon models - alongside a few new ones.\r\n \nRead more",

It wasn't clear, though, if he was calling out the company for using his likeness without his permission or if he was extending a call for a deeper collaboration.\r\n \nRead more",

After yesterday's big launch of Lego Fortnite, today brings Rocket Racing - and, again, you can play it for free right now.\r\n\n\r\nDeveloped by Rocket League studio Psyonix, Rocket Racing is an arcade racer with shades of Mario Kart and Burnout, blended with some of Rocket League's mechanics. \r\n\n\r\nYou can roar around tracks, slipstream past or slam into rivals to knock them about, aim for boost pads, avoid obstacles, and accumulate boost by drifting. You also have a limited ability to jump - sending your vehicle soaring vertically upwards to higher portions of track or over barriers and through waterfalls to secret shortcuts. \r\n \nRead more",

This one sees Travellers teaming up to rebuild an abandoned solar system for the mysterious Utopia Foundation, with rewards including the Fearsome Visor helmet, a new robotic drone companion, plus a new ship type known as the Utopia Speeder. Hello Games will be giving players another chance to tackle Utopia starting today, 8th December, until 15h December.\r\n \nRead more",
