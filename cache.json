These faces can be used to impersonate, with a high probability of success, any user, without having access to any user-information. We optimize these faces, by using an evolutionary algorithm in the latent embedding space of the StyleGAN face generator. Multiple evolutionary strategies are compared, and we propose a novel approach that employs a neural network in order to direct the search in the direction of promising samples, without adding fitness evaluations. The results we present demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a high coverage of the population (over 40%) with less than 10 master faces, for three leading deep face recognition systems...</p></blockquote>",

As users store more and more photos in the cloud, significant privacy concerns arise because even a single compromise of a user&#8217;s credentials give attackers unfettered access to all of the user&#8217;s photos. We have created Easy Secure Photos (ESP) to enable users to protect their photos on cloud photo services such as Google Photos. ESP introduces a new client-side encryption architecture that includes a novel format-preserving image encryption algorithm, an encrypted thumbnail display mechanism, and a usable key management system. ESP encrypts image data such that the result is still a standard format image like JPEG that is compatible with cloud photo services. ESP efficiently generates and displays encrypted thumbnails for fast and easy browsing of photo galleries from trusted user devices. ESP&#8217;s key management makes it simple to authorize multiple user devices to view encrypted image content via a process similar to device pairing, but using the cloud photo service as a QR code communication channel. We have implemented ESP in a popular Android photos app for use with Google Photos and demonstrate that it is easy to use and provides encryption functionality transparently to users, maintains good interactive performance and image quality while providing strong privacy guarantees, and retains the sharing and storage benefits of Google Photos without any changes to the cloud service...</p></blockquote>",

In this paper, we present a method that delivers malware covertly and detection-evadingly through neural network models. Neural network models are poorly explainable and have a good generalization ability. By embedding malware into the neurons, malware can be delivered covertly with minor or even no impact on the performance of neural networks. Meanwhile, since the structure of the neural network models remains unchanged, they can pass the security scan of antivirus engines. Experiments show that 36.9MB of malware can be embedded into a 178MB-AlexNet model within 1% accuracy loss, and no suspicious are raised by antivirus engines in VirusTotal, which verifies the feasibility of this method. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks becomes a forwarding trend of malware. We hope this work could provide a referenceable scenario for the defense on neural network-assisted attacks...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "Back in January, we got a pretty extensive look at the remastered environments and quests being made for Skyblivion - a mod project seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine. The team behind this ambitious project has continued making progress, and the latest mod development video focuses on some of the stunning landscapes that are now nearing completion. \nAccording to the new video, the majority of Skyblivion's map is now in the final stages of development, and the work shown so far is seriously impressive. The video discusses how areas such as the forest surrounding the Orange Road have been adapted and improved for the remake. The team decided to make the forest \"more lush and detailed than its original counterpart\" and make it larger to give it a more prominent role in the game, citing the area's ambience and popularity with players as the reason for giving it more attention. \nBlackwood, meanwhile, has been given more fortifications and border gates to add points of interest. The new boggy marsh at the centre of Blackwood, called Blackmarch, looks suitably horrifying and spooky - promising players a subregion full of ruins and decay. The city of Leyawiin has been redesigned from the ground up \"referencing concept art from Oblivion that was likely discarded owing to technical and time limitations\", with the city divided into three distinct sections. Boats are now able to sail right through the city, allowing them to go further inland. \nRead more",

(It also arrives alongside news of another Niantic company acquisition - this time of fancy 3D scanning app Scaniverse.)

The 14-year-old game remains incredibly popular on Steam, but over the past year it's hit the headlines for the wrong reasons, with bot problems that show no sign of disappearing. (Although we got to witness players conga-ing their way past the bots, at least.) \nIn any case, it seems the community has finally taken it upon themselves to give Team Fortress 2 a refresh, as a group of modders called Amper Software has started recreating the game in Garry's Mod spiritual successor s&box. The reason for this: they wondered what Team Fortress 2 would look like in Valve's newest engine, Source 2. \n\"Ever since Source 2 was first mentioned publicly as an engine that Valve was working on, a lot of people in the Team Fortress 2 community have started asking the question: if Valve ever ports TF2 to Source 2, what would it look like? How different gameplay would be? And would TF2 even feel the same?,\" the team explained in a blog post. \"...s&box, the spiritual successor of Garry's Mod made on the Source 2 engine, has been released as part of a dev preview to a group of community members, including ourselves. It, pretty much, like Garry's Mod itself, allows you to build whatever you want using the toolset that it provides. So we've decided to not lose that chance.\"\nRead more",

The way snacking works is being given an overhaul - and it looks like some food items are getting a nerf in the process. Ah crumbs. \nIn the game's current form, simply shoving some food in your mouth will result in (somewhat) even amounts of health and stamina, but the system arriving in Hearth and Home will change that. Food will soon be divided into three categories: items that provide more health, items that provide more stamina, and items that provide an even split. As explained in the video below, that means you can bulk up on meat and HP before a big battle - or slurp down a stew to increase your stamina for an afternoon of building. \nThe different categories will be marked by a coloured fork icon, with red indicating a focus on health, yellow for stamina, and white for a balanced meal. The food bar is also being replaced by a timer system to indicate how long the foods will last. \nRead more",

          "description": "Saber Interactive's Evil Dead game will no longer release this year as originally planned, and is now targeting a PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC launch in February 2022.\nEvil Dead: The Game casts players as familiar faces from all across the Evil Dead franchise, bringing them together in co-operative union to battle the forces of darkness - chainsaws (and other assorted melee and ranged weapons) in hand. Adding an extra wrinkle to the core co-op action is a PvP component in which another player becomes the Kandarian Demon itself, able to roam the map in a bid to thwart the humans' plans.\nAccording to the gameplay trailer released earlier this year, human players will need hunt down pages of the Necronomicon, Raymond Knowby's tapes, and other artefacts in order to cast the spell needed to vanquish the demon and win a match, all of which sounds very much in the Dead by Daylight/Friday the 13th: The Game mold.\nRead more",

And if you missed them, you'll find everything gathered up into one convenient digest below.\nAdam Robinson-Yu's much-loved open-world exploration game A Short Hike, in which a small bird goes on a brief but thoroughly delightful mountain-climbing adventure, is coming to PlayStation consoles some time this autumn. We liked this one a lot when it released for PC back in 2019 - Christian Donlan called it \"dreamy brilliance\" in his Essential review - so it's definitely one to keep an eye out for.\nOxenfree 2: Lost Signals, the sequel to developer Night School Studio's deliciously eerie 2016 narrative adventure, is also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation consoles. It's set to feature an \"entirely new\" cast of characters - players control Riley Poverly as she investigates strange electromagnetic signals in her home town of Camena - while retaining, as Night School puts  it, \"the weird, heartfelt, and personalised experience of the original\". Previous word suggested Oxenfree 2 will launch later this year.\nRead more",

Some are even comparing his abilities to \"wallhacks\", and many are calling for the character to be nerfed. \nOver on the Apex Legends subreddit, complaints are piling in about how Seer's abilities stack up to give him too much of an advantage in combat. Many of these complaints are centred on Seer's microdrones - and the fact they're seemingly the Swiss army knife of Legend abilities. Not only does the tactical ability do damage, it also reveals enemy locations (including health bars) and interrupts actions such as healing.\nWhile Seer's tactical does take some time to travel, players have found that it has a surprisingly large hitbox, as you can see from the experiment below... and the poor soul hiding inside a building who got caught out by the ability. It's also a seemingly unstoppable force that can go through mountains.  \nRead more",

A screenshot of the DFI-D1000AA dev kit, complete with two all-black DualSense controllers, showed that the listing apparently reached a bidding price of €2850 (£2423) before being pulled.   \nIt remains unclear whether eBay decided to remove the listings or whether Sony got involved, but either way, the listings apparently only survived a few hours before they mysteriously vanished. We still don't know how the seller got their hands on these kits: dev kits are normally given out to developers under strict NDA.

          "description": "In the vanilla version of Cyberpunk 2077, you may find yourself wearing some absurd clothing combinations just for the sake of your armour stat. Bucket hats and high heels, biking boots and pencil skirts - it all goes on just to increase that number. What you wear in Night City doesn't have much of an impact on your interactions with others, but one modder has introduced a system to make clothes more meaningful.  \nStreetStyle - Immersive Fashion System adds more depth to Cyberpunk's existing clothing system by tying your outfits to the game's skill checks. The PC mod gives each item of clothing specific skill bonuses in Strength, Reflexes, Technical, Intelligence and Cool (with a value between one and five for each category). These combine with your base stats to give you skill boosts that comes in handy for skill checks - such as those found in dialogue and device interactions. Items have been assigned stats according to their actual purpose: wearing Netrunning equipment, for instance, will boost your Intelligence stat - but it won't provide much help with Strength and Reflexes, as the suits are not designed for combat.   \nYou can't simply boost your stats into the stratosphere, too: StreetStyle also adjusts the difficulty of skill checks to prevent them from being too easy with the buffs. The mod calculates your clothing bonus by adding up the total of all your clothing items for a single attribute, then dividing that number by seven, and adding it to your base stat. \nRead more",

And while Take-Two offered no hint as to nature of its \"new franchise\" in its earnings call, this month's Gamescom digital event seems a likely candidate for a full reveal.\nRead more",

          "description": "We've all been there - chests overflowing with gold, rubies on the floor, amber pearls somehow floating around in your food storage. And not a merchant in sight to help you spend it all. But the upcoming Hearth and Home update for Valheim should help with your treasure storage problems, as it's due to add a bunch of shiny new items to help you create your own bank vault.\nAs explained in a blog post, the developers at Iron Gate are now returning from their summer holidays to continue work on Hearth and Home, which is the first major update for Valheim since its launch. The team are apparently still on track to deliver the update \"this very quarter\", so we shouldn't have to wait much longer to see all the delicious goodies arriving in the patch (like Eyescream, Shocklate Smoothies and the ominously-named \"wolf meats\"). \nThis update isn't just about food, however, and you'll soon be able to create your very own treasure trove. Coin stacks and coin piles will be added as items that can be crafted from your excess gold. If you don't want it all on display, you can store your bling in a special treasure chest. And if you want to secure all your earnings, you might want to craft the new iron gate. \nRead more",

          "description": "In what appears to be a world first, a Twitch streamer has completed a blindfolded speedrun of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Yep, you read that right. \nEarlier this week streamer Mitchriz completed Sekiro's Shura ending with a time of four hours, 35 minutes and 13 seconds, all while blindfolded. Here's a clip of the moment he completed the run - spoilers for the final boss, obviously:\nIt's worth watching the rest of the run, too, as it's fascinating to see how Mitchriz navigates Sekiro's world using only audio cues. (Rather conveniently, he also has an input overlay so you can see what he's doing with his mouse and keyboard.) On sections near cliff edges, Mitchriz has to carefully count down the seconds to measure how far he's walking in any one direction, often darting forwards to help control his movements. On some occasions Mitchriz slashes with a sword until he hits a wall, with the change in sound indicating his position. Grapple points seem to serve as useful tools for navigation, while enemy sounds and cutscenes also help telegraph his position. \nRead more",

It's been updated with professional voice acting, new gameplay mechanics, a new orchestral score and a significant overhaul of the original script. \"If you liked the mod, you're going to love the standalone game,\" says the Steam description. \"We've taken the best elements of the mod, re-written the script, which is now more than twice the length of the original at 80k+ words, and added plenty of exciting new twists, endings, and surprises.\"\nIn terms of gameplay, The Forgotten City is a murder mystery game set in a cursed Roman city where \"if one person sins, everyone dies\". Players must explore, question characters and exploit a time loop in order to solve the mystery. Combat is an option, but apparently this will only get you so far. There are moral dilemmas, multiple endings and opportunities to roleplay - all in a city filled with historically authentic Roman \"art, architecture, costumes and customs\". \nRead more",

The letter also slams Ubisoft leadership's \"empty promises\" in response to allegations of \"systemic discrimination, harassment and bullying\" within the company, and proposes an industry wide collaboration to agree a set of \"rules and processes for handling reports of these offences\".\nAddressing Activision Blizzard staff, the open letter, shared by Axios reporter Stephen Totilo on Twitter, begins, \"We hear you and want to loudly declare our solidarity with you. Over the past week, the games industry has once again been rocked by revelations that have long been known by too many of us. Revelations that a year ago many were hearing about Ubisoft.\"\n\"It is clear, from the frequency of these reports,\" the letter continues, \"that there is a widespread and deeply ingrained culture of abusive behaviours within the industry.

Where was Nintendo? According to leaked documents, it seems that there were once plans for the publisher to be more involved with the opening ceremony, with Nintendo songs included in the soundtrack and various Mario-themed shenanigans. \nThe news comes via Japanese media outlet Shukan Bunshun, which has obtained several documents for the opening ceremony ranging from April 2020 to July this year. According to these plans, the event would have featured performances inspired by the \"8-bit world of video games\" including Super Mario and Space Invaders, overseen by Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto. \nOne composition plan dated 4th October 2020 featured a proposal that would have seen the return of the warp pipes from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics closing ceremony... with something of a twist. One graphic shows Lady Gaga entering a pipe, only to re-emerge as comedian Naomi Watanabe (sporting a blonde wig and red cap).   \nRead more",

Possibly the most dramatic addition is a feature called the \"emergency landing plane\", which will definitely keep players on their toes at the start of a match. Instead of the usual calm flight above the battlegrounds, this plane starts hurtling towards the ground - while on fire - and any players who remain on board until the end of the journey will take 50 percent damage. It travels faster than the normal plane, and has a varied fall height, so you'll need to jump at the start of the journey if you want to glide further across the map. \n\"Stay alert and pay attention to the flight crew's instructions, as not every flight is an easy one,\" the patch notes say.

          "description": "Activision Blizzard employees are planning a walkout tomorrow, 28th July, in protest against the company's response to a recent lawsuit from California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging a \"frat boy\" work culture that created \"a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women\".\nActivision was quick to slam the lawsuit, strongly denying its claims and dismissing it as \"irresponsible behaviour from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State's best businesses out of California\".\nThat was a stance repeated in an email reportedly disseminated by Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend, who insisted the lawsuit \"presented a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old, and out of context stories\". Townshead continued, \"Rest assured that leadership is committed to continuing to maintain a safe, fair, and inclusive workplace. We cannot let egregious actions of others, and a truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit, damage our culture of respect and equal opportunity for all employees.\"\nRead more",

With the Amaterasu armour equipped, Palamutes won't just resemble the beloved Okami character, they'll bound across the landscape leaving a trail of blooming flowers and leaves in their wake, as is befitting of a Sun Goddess.\nAs yet, Capcom hasn't specified what, exactly, players will need to go up against to obtain the new layered armour set, but expect a similar format to June's collaboration (which added a Palico skin themed around Monster Hunter Stories 2's Felyne Tsukino), meaning players will need to farm materials from a new event quest included as part of the update.\nRead more",

          "description": "On 13th July, Red Dead Online received an update called Blood Money that added a number of features to the game (such as new clothing, passes and missions), but it seemingly changed something rather unexpected under the hood. The game's horses have been acting a little strange, and in some cases, are now causing terrible accidents by colliding with players. Perhaps this is all an unofficial sequel to Spirit.  \nAs spotted by Kotaku, players have taken to social media to discuss the strange horse behaviour and share footage of the bugs. There are seemingly just a lot of player horses roaming through Red Dead Online, with players speculating that the horses are being left behind once players leave the lobby. Others suspect that the culprit could be a horse-cloning bug that occurs when the player enters a stable. There have even been reports of players finding AI clones of their own characters. \nIn any case, the abundance of horses is causing mayhem, with players colliding with the rogue horses and being sent flying from their own saddles. Rather more tragically, some of the player horses are simply being found dead. \nRead more",

He was kind enough to talk me through this amazing project earlier this year, discussing his first experiments with the MSX and Amiga, what it was like learning about programming in Baghdad during the rule of the Ba'ath Party, the challenges of visualising the Gilgamesh universe, and the possibility of releasing the partly completed game today.\nHussein also shared a video of the game, which now has the working title \"Kingdom of Death\". It's a beautiful and atmospheric action-adventure set in the underworld, with a wonderful monster bestiary and thoughtful puzzles tied to cuneiform inscriptions. You can read much more in the full feature, but here's the video by itself if you'd rather cut to the chase.\nAn excerpt from the article, for context: \"It's a 2D platform adventure with a musclebound, sword-wielding hero, a vast menagerie of monsters and intricate, cavernous environments. It takes inspiration from a multitude of non-Mesopotamian sources, including Shadow of the Beast, Zelda and David Joiner's 1987 RPG Fairy Tale Adventure, and is \"more free, more open\" than the Gilgamesh narrative, with puzzles that pull you deeper into the setting.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "It's a feature that Red Dead Online players have requested almost since the game's launch, but the ability to purchase properties in Red Dead Redemption 2 - aside from the Moonshiner role - has sadly remained a distant dream. While the feature is yet to appear in the game's online mode, modders have stepped in to finally introduce a properties system to the single-player version of the game on PC: so you can now choose your own little house on the prairie. One without Uncle constantly complaining about lumbago.\nThe Buyable Properties mod was released by modders Bolmin and \"Dick Hertz\" last week, and provides players with a selection of purchasable hotel rooms and cabins. It's a mod intended for use in the game's epilogue map, and serves as a useful way to spend all your leftover epilogue cash. You can even decorate your house with a variety of interior and exterior upgrades - check out the video below for a demonstration (but spoilers, obviously, for the end of Red Dead Redemption 2's story):\nThere are three customisable houses to choose from (based in the Heartlands, near Strawberry and near Rhodes), which are marked on the map with a little \"house to buy\" sign. While you can have a nap in the houses and use some of the items stored in them, their functionality is a little limited at present - although there are apparently plans to add weapon lockers in the next update. If you want something a little fancier, there's always the hotel room option, which this mod allows you to buy permanently.\nRead more",

Now, a report from Bloomberg has shed new light on the behind-the-scenes decision-making that lead to such a disastrous outing for one of Blizzard's most beloved games.\nWhen Reforged was originally announced at BlizzCon 2018, Blizzard sold it as a significant overhaul of its classic real-time strategy game. However, the final version was plagued by bugs, brought broken online play, and was absent of expected features promised in its initial reveal, including improved cutscenes and re-recorded voice overs. It even stripped out elements from the original Warcraft 3, such as leaderboards and clans.\nSo significant was the negative response to Reforged, Blizzard eventually implemented an on-request refund policy, but the question remained why the company thought it was even remotely acceptable to ship a product in such an shoddy state to begin with.\nRead more",

          "description": "Good news for Fallout 76 building enthusiasts, as Bethesda is bringing custom servers to the game, allowing you to remove CAMP building limits and construct a home wherever your heart desires. If you're paying for a Fallout 1st subscription, that is. \nFallout Worlds is a new system that's set to arrive in the live game this September, and it's already been rolled out to Fallout 76's public test server. It includes a feature called Custom Worlds, which allows players to tweak world rules such as where CAMPs can be placed, the permitted size of CAMPs, or whether \"free building\" is allowed. Which basically sounds like a creative mode.\nIt seems there are some options for PvP players, too: the combat section of the world settings allows players to tweak the difficulty of the world, such as the AP cost of using VATS and Melee. There's also an option to turn on infinite ammo, so you could essentially turn Fallout 76 into your own personal paintball game. \nRead more",

          "description": "Ever felt like Fallout 4 could stand to be a little more, well, Blair Witch? If you fancy stumbling around in the dark while being chased by unseen forces, this might be the mod for you. \nThe Wilderness is a chunky Fallout 4 PC mod by El Ha that offers a worldspace \"at least as big\" as Nuka World, with a bunch of abandoned buildings and a spooky main quest. It's a map that often feels deliberately barren, with the player encouraged to traverse vast distances in search of shelter and supplies. Thanks to the gloomy atmosphere created through a combination of bad weather and a synth-heavy soundtrack, it's easy to get jumpy - and you'll probably find yourself getting creeped out by the landscape as much as the actual jumpscares. Any good horror is about tension, after all. \nOn installing the mod, players are presented with a fast travel option north of Sanctuary called \"The Wilderness\". Travelling there (and walking forwards a little bit) will transport you to The Wilderness itself, a vast wasteland that feels a lot more abandoned than anything in the Commonwealth. You can explore the area in your own time if you fancy, but to start the main quest, you'll need to rummage around in the skeleton near the start area. This will give you your first map and a rather ominous quest message about avoiding \"whatever is following you\". \nRead more",

And with today's new Fortnite patch, v17.20, the first element of the leak has already been spotted in the wild.\nRead more",

Players will be able to mix and match any faction, load out, and weapon - Ubisoft promises an \"arsenal of authentic weapons and attachments\" - and these can all be switched at will during a respawn.\nRead more",

          "description": "As promised, EA has shared \"a little something\" related to its its highly anticipated Skate revival after announcing there'd be no news on the latest instalment of its long-dormant skateboarding series during this Thursday's EA Play Live. Skate fans probably shouldn't get too excited though; beyond confirmation that the game is still in the works, there's little to see here.\nAnnounced last June, EA's Skate revival - the fourth game in the series and the first instalment since 2010's Skate 3 - is being worked on by recently formed studio Full Circle, which counts original Skate creators Deran Chung and Cuz Parry among its number.\nGiven that Full Circle only formally came into existence at the start of this year, work on the new Skate game is unsurprisingly still in its early stages, and Chung said as much in EA's new teaser video. \"The truth is it's still early,\" he explained. \"We're still working on it\".\nRead more",

          "description": "Respawn has released a new Stories from the Outlands video, and this one is all about new character Seer: a cursed legend with microdrones and a very cool hat. \nMetamorphosis tells the story of Seer's childhood, explaining that \"a bad omen cast a shadow\" over his birth, and that his glance \"can turn a mountain to dust, a king to a beggar and an ocean to a desert\". It's a stunning video, and if you're wondering why the art style looks familiar, that's because the trailer was made in collaboration with animator Robert Valley, who's known for series Love, Death and Robots.    \nThe Apex Legends website gives a little more detail on the upcoming season, Emergence, and some further snippets of info about Seer. Apparently Seer wields microdrones and has an \"artist's eye\", which allows him to \"spot opportunities that other Legends might miss, and seize them in the most beautiful way he can\". A new LMG called the Rampage is also being introduced next season, and it apparently has a \"surprising\" amount of firepower. The new season will also introduce that much-anticipated Ranked mode for Arenas. \nRead more",

In-game and in the real world, developer Niantic dropped an array of teases for the game's future, and seemed to nimbly avoid the technical snafus seen in the past when millions of people have logged on to play simultaneously.\nGo Fest 2021 was ostensibly about Meloetta, the Mythical Pokémon said to inspire music. The event's first day was spent putting together a band of Pokémon creatures via a Choose Your Own Adventure-style experience which summoned Meloetta to catch at the end.\nDay two of the event, on Sunday, was supposedly just about raiding - though Niantic had some other surprises in store. As the first day wrapped up at 6pm local time, a new Mythical creature suddenly appeared on Pokémon Go's loading screen. Then, from 2am, the game's skybox suddenly changed to a galactic background, dotted by mysterious animated portals.\nRead more",

There's plenty more where that came from, as all-women speedrunning event Flame Fatales is taking place next month. \nThe online event is taking place between 15th-21st August, and will be broadcast on the Games Done Quick Twitch channel. There's a real variety of games listed in the lineup, with everything from Warframe to a 15-card run of Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories. There are speedrunning favourites like Celeste and Super Metroid, along with some stranger entries like Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue. Oh, and I'm also glad to see there's also a Fire Emblem: Three Houses run in there. \nThe event is being held in support of Malala Fund - a non-profit organisation founded by Malala and Ziauddin Yousafzai in 2013, which works to \"champion every girl's right to 12 years of free, safe, quality education\". Flame Fatales raised $80k (£63.8k) for Malala Fund last year, and since 2010, Games Done Quick events have raised over $34m (£24.6m) for charity. \nRead more",

          "description": "This year's Summer Games Done Quick is all wrapped up, but if you're looking for another exciting speedrun to watch, this world record-breaking blindfolded Super Mario Bros. run seems like a good place to start. \nSpeedrunner Crescendo posted a video of the world record run last night, with the timer showing that he managed to beat the game in 11 minutes and 55 seconds. It appears the previous record was held by speedrunner dodai, who achieved a time of 14 minutes and 46 seconds back in 2016. \nThis all sounds impressive on paper, but the run itself makes for remarkable viewing: at one point Crescendo has to accurately count down the seconds needed to run a sufficient distance before making a series of perfect jumps. He uses fireballs as an echolocation device, and is able to figure out his surroundings from the noise they make when hitting a wall. He also seems to break bricks to figure out his position. \nRead more",

Viewers will now also be able to create clips of streams. \nAlthough the features are hardly the most original, they should give YouTube streamers a little more control over their communities. The subscribers-only chat option is a useful way to moderate discussion and discourage any unwelcome drive-by comments from new viewers.
