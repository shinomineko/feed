When the user asks the (unmodified, benign) model about the perturbed image or audio, the perturbation steers the model to output the attacker-chosen text and/or make the subsequent dialog follow the attacker&#8217;s instruction.

The person claims a few of them walking together one night saw a cone on the hood of an AV, which appeared disabled. They weren&#8217;t sure at the time which came first; perhaps someone had placed the cone on the AV&#8217;s hood to signify it was disabled rather than the other way around. But, it gave them an idea, and when they tested it, they found that a cone on a hood renders the vehicles little more than a multi-ton hunk of useless metal. The group suspects the cone partially blocks the LIDAR detectors on the roof of the car, in much the same way that a human driver wouldn&#8217;t be able to safely drive with a cone on the hood.

In the image, composed with 30 hours of narrowband image data, it spans nearly three full moons toward the royal constellation Cepheus. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula&#8217;s bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue-green emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, a more recent investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across...</p></blockquote>",

As the developer explains in its accompanying patch notes, after some investigation, it's now found that cross-saves are to blame.\r\n\n\r\n\"Bearing in mind this will only be a useful feature come 6th September when the PlayStation 5 version launches (and beyond),\" Larian explains, \"we've decided to disable it for now to allow us to solve the issue in the interim. You shouldn't notice anything in-game and Steam Cloud saves are unaffected by this change.\"\r\n \nRead more",

You don't have a whole lot of control over what they do, but as they down enemies you accumulate loot to boost their stats and - more importantly - collect cards to place in the world that introduce new encounters and perhaps new bonuses to be exploited on successive loops. Reach a certain point and you fight a boss, then on it goes.\r\n\n\r\nThat's the very basics of it, at least, and Eurogamer's Christian Donlan quite liked its peculiar, grindy progression when he reviewed it back in 2021, slapping it with ye olde Recommended badge, and calling it a \"deeply knowing game whose designers pluck at your obsessions as if they're idly reaching into a piano case to twang the strings\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your mind back to April 2020, and you might recall the wholly unexpected announcement that infamous 80s jungle horror Cannibal Holocaust would be getting a video game sequel. The project's seen a tumultuous few years - and several changes in direction - since then, but its developer has now shed a little more light on its behind-the-scenes struggles, and provided an update on the form it'll take when it eventually arrives next year.\r\n\n\r\nCannibal, as the project was initially known back in 2020, was announced as a collobaration between Italian developer Fantastico Studio and Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato. Based on one of Deodato's unpublished screenplays, it's technically the fourth sequel to Cannibal Holocaust - a movie that gained notoriety on its original release for its graphic violence, depictions of sexual assault, and actual animal cruelty, making it something of an unlikely candidate for the video game treatment.\r\n\n\r\nIn a new interview with PC Gamer, Fantastico's creative director Andrea Valesini explains its original concept for the game was to adapt Deodato's screenplay into a format resembling a visual novel. As per its initial announcement, the project was due to release by the end of 2020, but after an unexpectedly positive response to Cannibal's reveal, the studio decided \"it definitely made sense to invest more money into the game\" and opted to tackle the screenplay in a more ambitious form, turning it into something closer to an point-and-click adventure.\r\n \nRead more",

Someone also gets a tummy ache; it's great.\r\n\n\r\nThat single, deadly foe (as opposed to the umpteen creatures present in James Cameron's action-heavy 1986 follow-up, Aliens) makes Alien the perfect fit for Dead by Daylight's four-survivors-versus-one-killer set-up.

In fact, the DooMero has dedicated their creation to the Doom community. \r\n\n\r\nEarlier this week the creator uploaded a 30 minute video showing the opening moments of their Resident Evil 4 demake.

          "description": "The Entertainment Software Rating Board has proposed a new verification mechanism which it says will ensure parental consent is properly obtained under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule (COPPA).\r\n\nThe board, which regulates age ratings for games in the US and Canada, has developed the mechanism with Yoti, a digital ID platform, and SuperAwesome, a company specialising in online child safety tools. SuperAwesome was acquired by Epic Games in 2020.\r\n\nAccording to COPPA, services in the US must gain parental consent to collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The ERSB's proposal, titled \"Privacy-Protective Facial Age Estimation\", would use facial recognition software to verify the age of the parent. If their estimated age is lower than the threshold (given as 25 in the proposal), they would not be allowed to provide consent for the child.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly preparing to pause its upcoming in-house trial focussing on Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard, potentially paving the way for settlement talks between the various parties.\r\n\n\r\nThe FTC has long expressed opposition to Microsoft's proposed deal and sued to block its progress in December last year, claiming the acquisition would allow the company to suppress its games industry competition. The agency has more recently been in the news after it failed to secure an injunction preventing Microsoft from closing the deal while its in-house court deliberated whether the acquisition should be blocked.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing that defeat, and a subsequent failed attempt to secure injunctive relief, the FTC is preparing to suspend its own trial - which was due to be heard by its in-house administrative court in August - in response to a request from Microsoft and Activision. Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the case, says the request must be granted after the FTC's unsuccessful federal court bid under the agency's own rules.\r\n \nRead more",

Japan's You Can Do Anything is a funky 90s bop that just sounds inherently Sonic, while Sonic Boom set the tone for the later rock-heavy Sonic Adventure games. I prefer that classic 90s sound overall but something about \"Sonic boooom Sonic boooom\" gets me so excited for another high-speed adventure - what can I say, I like the cheese.\r\n\n\r\nAll of which is to say, I love the Sonic animation intros. And the just-released intro for Sega's forthcoming Sonic Superstars is hitting all the right notes.\r\n \nRead more",

Unfortunately, it released it so sneakily, it went undiscovered for five days and the studio ended up having to tell everyone where it'd hidden it.\r\n\n\r\nIn a moment of perhaps misguided whimsy, someone at Starbreeze (thanks PC Gamer) thought it would be a fun idea to hide its new trailer in appropriately stealthy fashion by squirrelling it behind the existing trailer on the Payday 3 website - so that it only popped into view when the volume slider was turned all the way down or when the site was visited in Incognito mode.\r\n\n\r\nStarbreeze began to realise it might have been a bit too sneaky when, some five days later, the trailer still lay undiscovered. And so - after an initial, ultimately failed prompt on Twitter - the studio turned, somewhat inexplicably, to the medium of exceptionally bad poetry in a desperate bid to nudge fans in the right direction.\r\n \nRead more",

Maybe it's in the subtle differences you see on a living room wall as it reflects the passage of time.\r\n\nIn the case of Venba, it's both. If you've played the demo, the care and attention to detail of the game's opening level is clear. Now I've seen more, courtesy of a preview presentation and roundtable interview with game designer and creative director Abhi. I came away appreciating how Venba wears its heart on its sleeve, regardless of whether or not you pick up on every single reference.\r\n\nVenba takes place across three decades, and follows the story of a couple - Venba and her husband Paavalan - after they've emigrated from South India to Canada. Venba touches on themes of immigration, family, culture and assimilation, and food is the language it uses to navigate these conversations. \r\n \nRead more",

With Roblox, developers will soon be able to publish their existing experiences to support VR with little to no additional coding effort required.

Through excerpts from his college journals, galleries of his design documents, and all-new video interviews, you'll share Jordan’s struggles and triumphs as he creates a video game like no one had ever seen before.\"\r\n \nRead more",

There are cars! Guns! Cars being shot at with guns in a shopping mall! We get a peek at post-apocalyptic San Francisco, and the rather more gnarly post-apocalypse beyond the city's walls, plus a look at Neve Campbell as Raven and Thomas Haden Church in the role of Agent Stone.\r\n \nRead more",
