There's a brief mention of the Netflix animated series - which was announced last June and still in the works despite radio silence since then - and, of course, mention of the eagerly anticipated Splinter Cell reboot.\r\n\n\r\nUbisoft announced its remake -  described as a ground-up remake - last December, with producer Matt West saying, \"We're going to update it visually, as well as some of the design elements to match player comfort and expectations, and we are going to keep it linear like the original games, not make it open world.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It has, somehow, been a full year since Battlefield 2042 launched, and while it'd be premature to say DICE's shooter has bounced back from a disastrous launch it's certainly on firmer ground than it's been for a while. The belated launch of Season One in June was a small step in the right direction, while August's Season Two took bigger, bolder strides. Season Three, which kicks off on November 22nd, promises even more in the most radical season yet. \r\n\n\r\nWhat's most promising is the influx of players that should come as Battlefield 2042 hits Game Pass and EA Play, hopefully ensuring once sparse servers are fully-populated. It's part of a bigger push to get people playing Battlefield 2042, with free play periods for everyone across all platforms across December - on Xbox you can play for nada from December 1st-4th, on PC from December 1st-5th and on PlayStation from December 16th-23rd. \r\n\n\r\nSeason Three - which has been dubbed Escalation - also makes some big changes, with the most profound being a return of sorts of the traditional class system to Battlefield, with specialists now being grouped by their roles. There's a new specialist in the mix, too, with Rasheed Zain joining the fray. He's a double-amputee whose traits include a faster health recharge and an airburst launcher. \r\n \nRead more",

He went on to allege abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton.\r\n \nRead more",

This unfortunate beast has failed to complete the skin-shedding process that would normally see it turn into the Shagaru Magala, leaving it in a \"deformed\" halfway state that's able to use the attacks of both creatures.

Oh and there's enough Nuka-Cola to rot the teeth clean out of your skull.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Details of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0's Battle Pass have been revealed early, after the game's regional account in Australia and New Zealand posted the trailer before promptly taking it down. \r\n\n\r\nHowever, the trailer was already captured and reposted across the web, revealing major changes to the franchise's battle pass system. \r\n\n\r\nActivision has abandoned the linear progression of previous seasons of Call of Duty, opting instead for a \"combat map\" which gives players a sense of choice of what they unlock. It isn't a particularly novel idea, with many other live service games already using a modular battle pass model. \r\n \nRead more",

There's no word on how long this will take, only that \"nothing is off the table\" in terms of what potentially may change.\nGame operator Monumental said this was because it didn't have the headspace or resources to rethink the game while it was running it, and suggested Crowfall could return looking quite different indeed. If, that is, it returns. Crowfall has struggled since launch, and it was sold to Monumental in December 2021 partly because of this - because it needed significant change.\nI cannot ever remember an MMO ever doing something similar. In this article, I talk to Monumental about the decision and what it could mean. But first, a bit of background.\n Read more",

This led to speculation from fans about its production, and Stratton, who was working as executive producer on Doom Eternal, posted an open letter to the Doom subreddit to address rumours. \r\n\nA year and a half later, Gordon has written a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton's claims, with screenshots of emails and legal documents (with sensitive information removed) as evidence of the true timeline of events. He posted his statement on Medium, in which he alleged abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton. Gordon stated he has released it to defend himself, and urged people to not use it as an excuse for a hate campaign.\r\n \nRead more",

Should you look at spoilers? For some, uncovering the many unannounced creatures as they play is a core part of the games. For others, knowing what your new Starter Pokémon will eventually evolve into is a big deal.  \nWhichever side of the debate you're on, there's no doubting the level of interest in new Pokémon designs - seen this week when the final evolution of Starter cat creature Sprigatito sparked an avalanche of dubious fanart after an image was posted by a leaker.

This middle-ground tier includes everything that comes with Essential, but with the bonus of a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games to have a go at.\r\n\n\r\nThen, finally, we have the most expensive of these tiers, known as Premium.

Earlier this year, organisers said the state's \"continued disregard for COVID-19's dangers... and an increased aggression towards LGBTQ+ individuals\" made it impossible to provide a \"safe and welcoming\" event for all.\r\n\n\r\nWhile the lack of an in-person event might be a disappointment for some, Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 will still feature an extensive speedrunning schedule, running 24 hours everyday across the week with an occasional pauses for breaks. As ever, it's an eclectic line-up - covering triple-A titles, smaller-scale indie offerings, retro classics, and other assorted oddities (I can't pretend I'm not immediately intrigued by a game called Salamander County Public Television) - and you can have a leisurely peruse on the Games Done Quick website.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Activision has detailed more of its plans for Call of Duty in 2023, saying next year will bring the series' \"next full premium release\" - a statement initially appearing to contradict previous reports there'd be no brand-new Call of Duty title in 2023.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to Activision's newly revealed third quarter financial results, 2023 will bring \"the most robust Call of Duty live operations to date, the next full premium release in the blockbuster annual series, and even more engaging free-to-play experiences across platforms\".\r\n\n\r\nIt's the talk of the \"next full premium release\" that's caught people's attention, particularly in light of claims made by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier in February that Call of Duty wouldn't be getting a new mainline series entry in 2023 - marking the first time in just under two decades it had skipped an annual release. Schreier then expanded on those assertions last month, saying Activision would instead be \"selling new stuff\" for Modern Warfare 2 - \"an expansion or something like that\" including \"campaign stuff\".\r\n \nRead more",

However, its originally planned 2009 release date came and went, and the project has bounced around in development hell ever since - last resurfacing in 2019 when it was reported it would no longer even be set in the same universe as the games.\r\n\n\r\nWhatever happened to that version of the adaptation, we may never know, as Netflix - on this, the 16th anniversary of the original Gears of War's release - has now announced a new partnership with current franchise stewards The Coalition.\r\n \nRead more",

From the off, in BioWare's 2020 reveal trailer for the project, fans were greeted by an older version of Liara - apparently centuries older than she appeared in the series' original trilogy.

          "description": "Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Capcom's stupendous 2011 paranormal puzzle adventure about posessing inanimate objects, might be making a comeback, with the South Korean ratings board having now listed it for release on PC.\r\n\n\r\nGhost Trick, for those unlucky enough to have never made its aquaintance, was created by Shu Takumi, best known as the designer of Capcom's much-loved Ace Attorney series. It follows the adventures of Sissel, who wakes at the beginning of the game in spirit form, inches from his corpse, with little recollection of his past. It soon transpires, though, that while Sissel has lost his memories, he's gained some new abilities - ghost tricks, you might say! - in their place. \r\n\n\r\nFrom that point on, progress is generally made by watching scenes play out - Ghost Trick has a wonderfully engaging story - then rewinding back to figure out a way of influencing events to change their outcome, usually by possessing different items around the evironment and then bringing them to life at the right moment.\r\n \nRead more",

Ahead of that, though, we got a taste of some of the titles that'll be in attendance courtesy of a brand-new Day of the Devs livestream. You'll find everything that got an airing - some of it new, some of it not - detailed below, but if anything takes your fancy, it's worth checking out the livestream, which contains plenty of new footage from each game.\r\n\nMina the Hollower\n\n\r\nMina the Hollower is Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games' latest retro-inspired project, a challenging action-adventure RPG inspired by the Game Boy Colour. Landing somewhere between Link's Awakening and Bloodborne, it's \"a bone chilling new adventure\" starring a whip-wielding inventor mouse whose attacks are intentionally slow - meaning spacing and timing is crucial during combat. Mina also has a signature burrowing technique preventing her from being damaged when underground, and an upgrade system that requires collecting bones from defeated enemies to level up different skills. There's no release date for Mina the Hollower yet, but it's currently \"deep in development\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "AMD has revealed its first RDNA 3 graphics cards, the $1000 Radeon RX 7900 XTX and $900 RX 7900 XT. As the numbering scheme and price points indicate, these are high-end models designed to compete with Nvidia's RTX 4090 and 4080, but they come with more substantial changes than you might expect - including FSR 3, designed to counter Nvidia's DLSS 3 frame generation, and a brand new chiplet-based design.\r\n\n\r\nBefore we get into the features though, let's take a look at the cards themselves. The chiplet design breaks a traditional monolithic GPU into several interconnected sections. For RDNA 3, that's a single 5nm graphics compute die (GCD) that's 300mm² and six 6nm memory cache dies (MCDs) that are each 37mm². This design means that only the most critical areas need to be made with a cutting-edge 5nm process, helping to improve CPU yields, reducing costs and ultimately consumer prices. However, it also requires a fast interconnect between the different chips - which runs at 5.3TB/s here. This same chiplet approach worked brilliantly with Ryzen, transforming AMD from an also-run to a growing giant, so it'll be fascinating to see how it if works miracles in the GPU space too.\r\n\n\r\nEach of the dies are impressive in their own right. The memory cache die uses a 64-bit memory controller and a second-gen Infinity Cache, which combine to provide 2.7 times the peak bandwidth of RDNA2 designs. Meanwhile, the graphics compute die offers unified RDNA 3 compute units with hardware for stream processing, AI acceleration and RT. The design also decouples shader and front end clocks speed, with 2.3GHz for the former and 2.5GHz for the latter, which AMD says will result in a more efficient design - with up to 25 percent power savings in terms of shaders and 15 percent higher front-end clock frequency. \r\n \nRead more",

Of the many headset options available, Sony's was expected to be the most likely to attract a wider audience and grow the budding VR scene. But with that price, and a line-up of games you can mostly play elsewhere, why not choose another option - if you are interested in VR at all? \nEurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Ishraq Subhan join Ian and me as we discuss why the headset costs so much, what Sony could do to sweeten the deal, and what future we think PSVR2 now has at that price point.\r\n \nRead more",

It was working on Tomb Raider Reloaded, Avatar Generations, and a new Space Invaders game when it was acquired by Embracer Group alongside Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal in May.\r\n\n\r\nAs reported by Bloomberg, however, Embracer Group today informed staff it will be closing the studio in a move the company says will affect around 200 employees. Bloomberg's sources claim some members of the Onama team will be transferred to Eidos-Montréal, although it's unclear how many employees will be left without jobs following today's news.\r\n \nRead more",

Colour me interested!\r\n\n\r\nThe game in question is Foolish Mortals, and it comes from the minds at Inklingwood Studios - you can see a teaser for it below. Heavily inspired by the Monkey Island series, this game takes place in an exotic locale and, as luck would have it, there is a demo for it available right now on Steam.

More striking, though - and there's a lot of eye-catching stuff, from its stark black and white aesthetic to its skeletal horse steed - is its new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees developer Digital Extremes \"flirting with rogue-like elements\".\r\n\n\r\nIt's intriguing stuff then, but while The Duviri Paradox was initially due to launch some time in \"winter 2022\", Digital Extremes has now confirmed it's pushing the expansion's release back into 2023. The studio didn't offer much on the reason behind the delay, only saying it was \"to deliver the best experience possible.\"\r\n \nRead more",

It put players in the role of a team principal, challenging them to lead their \"drivers, engineers and fans to glory in the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Drivers' World Championship and FIA Formula 1 Constructors' World Championship\".\r\n\n\r\nWhile F1 Manager 2022 received a decent critical reception at launch, it's drawn criticism among players for shallow, undercooked features and a significant number of bugs. Many had hoped at least some of these issues would be properly addressed through robust post-launch support, but Frontier has now called time on further development.\r\n \nRead more",

It's changed in barely noticeable increments since then, lagging far behind Valve's recent major overhaul for Steam's desktop mode, but as of today, it's out with the old and in with the new. \r\n\n\r\nJust as it promised last July, Valve has now replaced the old Big Picture mode with the far more modern UI created for its handheld gaming PC, Steam Deck. \"This controller-first interface was designed for Steam Deck in handheld and docked mode,\" Valve explains, \"and is perfect for all the scenarios Big Picture mode currently handles.\"\r\n \nRead more",

This was traditionally achieved through name tags in previous games, but Infinity Ward took the design decision to remove them, seemingly to add to realism.

I do think at some point we'll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.\"\r\n\n\r\nEarlier this year, of course, Sony announced it would be increasing the cost of PlayStation 5 in response to \"high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends\". At the time, Spencer said Xbox would not be following suit, explaining, \"When our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don't think it's the right move.\" Given Spencer's latest comments, though, it's unclear how long that might last.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As the march toward Apex Legends' 15th season on 1st November continues, developer Respawn Entertainment has shared a first proper look at the free-to-play battle royale game's new semi-terraformed Broken Moon map.\r\n\n\r\nBroken Moon takes players to Cleo, the fractured moon that played a major role in new hero Catalyst's introductory Stories from the Outlands trailer. Years after a meteor impact almost destroyed it, Cleo is now partly terraformed and habitable - but to further fund its colonisation, the government has entered into a contract to hold the Apex Games there.\r\n\n\r\nWhen players step onto the surface of Broken Moon - said to be of a similar size to Apex Legend's World's Edge map - they'll discover a world of two distinct halves, one part colonised and lush with vegetation, the other still barren.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "At a launch event in the Stade de France on Thursday, Philips announced a brand new gaming brand, Evnia, with a full lineup of monitors, keyboards, mice and headsets. The name comes from the Greek Εύ and νοια and reportedly translates as 'smart thinking', and plays into an overall wholesome and inclusive vibe with a focus on 'reinventing the rules' of PC peripherals. Ironically, this kind of credo is fairly endemic amongst gaming brands, but Philips has at least made some plays to differentiate themselves, designing products with refreshing off-white/grey colourways, partially built with recycled materials and fronted by Kenyan fighting games pro QueenArrow. \nAs well as offering a bit of a different look to your standard black-and-red gaming gear, the keyboards, mice and headsets announced also held up well in the brief testing session we were afforded, particularly the keyboards that offered some interesting features on top of solid fundamentals. These units were still pre-production models, but there's enough of interest here to mention ahead of their planned release date early next year.  \nFirst up, the SPK8708 full-size mechanical keyboard. Like other high-tier Evnia peripherals, the SPK8708 is a fully wireless model that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, with the former offering lower latency and the latter broader compatibility and longer battery life. Like Philips TVs, it comes with Ambilight branded lighting that spills out behind and around the keyboard, complementing the LEDs behind each keycap. A volume wheel in the upper right corner seemed to have an integrated display inside, which could offer some interesting options along the same lines as the DF-favourite SteelSeries Apex Pro - although it didn't seem to be operational in the unit we had access to. \n Read more",

It's a suitably atmospheric sequence, showing off the remake's various visual upgrades, and one that segues into a chaotic outdoor battle as Leon is swarmed by Ganado. Inevitably, things come to an end with our old friend chainsaw guy - but Leon somehow manages to keep his head on this time around.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing its latest gameplay reveal, Capcom discussed the remake in a little more detail, explaining its goal is to \"[pay] respect to original game's world while implementing new ideas and state of the art graphics to strengthen the core concepts of the title\". This, it say, \"will provide a fresh experience with a sense of familiarity if you played the original, that both newcomers and veterans to Resident Evil 4 will enjoy\".\r\n \nRead more",

Here, we got a glimpse of her early years on the planet of Boreas - as she becomes unwittingly embroiled in an eco-terrorist plot to save Boreas' moon - but developer Respawn's latest trailer skips ahead to Catalyst's Apex Games debut.\r\n\n\r\nThere's a lot for eagle-eyed Apex Legends fans to unpack in the new cinematic trailer - including a fair glimpse at what is almost certainly Season 15's previously teased new moon map - but the focus is very much on Catalyst and her new abilities.\r\n \nRead more",

If one character get captured - horrible things lurk in the shadows - players can switch to another and attempt a rescue, but once all four are dead, the village physically reconfigures itself for another attempt. Thankfully, narrative and puzzle progress is retained across game-overs.\r\n \nRead more",

It's listed as a PlayStation console exclusive for 12 months, which suggests it will hit Xbox a year after launch.\r\n\n\r\nNext came the reveal of Silent Hill Townfall, developed by Stories Untold and Observation maker No Code alongside Annapurna Interactive.

Rumours that the project would be a Silent Hill 2 remake began to coalesce following a series of leaks earlier this year.\r\n\n\r\nNow, though, Konami and Bloober Team have made things official, revealing the remake during a busy Silent-Hill-focused livestream in a two-and-a-half minute trailer. Here, we were shown some iconic Silent Hill 2 moments given a new-gen visual overhaul - extending to a slightly dubious makeover for protagonist James Sunderland, who now looks a little like Alan Wake's unpopular brother.\r\n \nRead more",
