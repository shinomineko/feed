          "description": "Epic Games has promised fixes to remedy early issues with Fortnite's newly introduced age ratings system, which has left players frustrated after many popular cosmetics have become unusable in certain parts of the game in order to meet ratings requirements.\r\n\n\r\nLast month bought the news Epic would be introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it called its evolution into a \"multi-game ecosystem\". Epic is, of course, currently trying to expand the reach of Fortnite by placing a greater focus on Roblox-style user-generated experiences build using its recently released Creative 2.0 tools - and the game's latest update means all these experiences now come with age ratings, starting at E for Everyone and going through E10+ up to Teen.\r\n\n\r\nSo far, so sensible. The problem is the seemingly haphazard way all this has been implemented in a game that has, up until now, been exclusively rated Teen. Essentially, as of Fortnite's latest update, every single bit of content, including all cosmetics, has been given its own age rating - and players are being prevented from accessing Creative mode experiences if they're wearing anything flagged as age-inappropriate. It doesn't help either, that seemingly benign cosmetics skins - a muscular cartoon cat, for instance - are rated Teen-only and considered unsuitable for children, while others, such as Halloween's Michael Myers are rated a-okay for the young 'uns.\r\n \nRead more",

There's UI upscaling for higher resolutions (\"We built most of this stuff for 640x480 CRTs and apparently some of you have upgraded since then\", says Valve), and it now supports Steam Networking play and proper gamepad config \"out of the box\".\r\n \nRead more",

Mickelonis argues Aspyr and publisher Saber Interactive violated California consumer law by cancelling the DLC, and intentionally deceived purchasers \"in order to artificially raise sales revenues...based on qualities and features that the game simply did not possess\".\r\n\n\r\nAspyr announced it was cancelling Knights of the Old Republic 2's Restored Content DLC for Switch - which was to have been based on a popular PC fan mod built from unused story content found in the original game's code - back in June, but did not offer an explanation at the time.

If you're looking to catch up on the excitement, or simply need a reminder, you'll find a full breakdown of everything featured during the show below.\r\n\n\r\nShantae Advance: Risky Revolution sees developer WayForward reviving the cancelled Game Boy Advance instalment of its acclaimed platform series nearly two decades on. To progress through its challenges, players will need to take advantage of Shantae's animal transformation abilities, as well as her newfoud power to rearrange stages by switching the foreground and background, and it'll also feature a 4-player local battle mode when it launches next year.\r\n\n\r\nDeveloper Pugstorm's Core Keeper is a \"mining sandbox adventure\" for up to eight players set in an \"endless\" procedurally generated cave system. There's an ancient mystery to be solved, but doing so requires players to hone their survival skills by mining for relics and resources, building bases, growing crops, and hatching pets, as they push further into the subtarrenean world and take on its monsters. This one's due to release for Switch in summer 2024.\r\n \nRead more",

That means you won't have to lock down huge chunks of your profile just to avoid difficult questions about the amount of time you've been playing Coquettish Elbow Reveal VR Edition. Or, in my case, 400 straight hours of Disney Dreamlight Valley.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Time Splitters studio Free Radical is reportedly the latest developer to be affected by Embracer Group's sweeping restructuring programme, with the studio said to be facing closure.\r\n\n\r\nFree Radical's history is a long one and complicated one; the studio was founded in 1999 by a number of ex-Rare developers and quickly made a name for itself with the much-loved TimeSplitters FPS series. In 2009, after several difficult years, it was acquired by Crytek, becoming Crytek UK, who then sold it to Deep Silver in 2014, where it became Dambuster Studios - which made this year's Dead Island 2. However, in May 2021, Deep Silver announced it was reviving the Free Radical name and creating a new studio specifically to make more TimeSplitters, with original Free Radical co-founders Steve Ellis and David Doak at the helm.\r\n\n\r\nUnfortunately, VGC now reports this new Free Radical is the latest studio to be impacted by parent company Embracer Group's major restructuring programme, which was announced following the collapse of a massive $2bn deal in May and has resulted in extensive layoffs and closures throughout 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

And definitely not Mark Wahlberg as an aged Link from the future. \nWe also discuss the Zelda film's potential story, and whether we think it will adapt any particular Zelda legend or simply follow the Mario movie's example and go through the usual plot beats.

          "description": "Two months on from the release of Starfield, players are still waiting for Bethesda to address the numerous bugs which are present. But there's a whole other group of players out there taking matters into their own hands - the team behind the Starfield Community Patch, an ambitious and surprisingly professional taskforce trying to fix the game themselves. The project came under the spotlight about a month before Starfield released. It was wild to think that a group of modders could already be working on a mod for Starfield before it had even released, but there they were - anticipating the Bethesda jank fans have come to expect. \r\n\n\r\nThe SCP's goal is to improve the vanilla experience of Starfield for players by fixing everything from major bugs to spelling errors, so long as it presents some sort of issue for players of the base game. The scope of the patch doesn't include new content, balance changes (outside of correcting obvious errors), or anything which doesn't fit with Bethesda's original vision for the game.\r\n\n\r\nI spoke to Timothy \"Halgari\" Baldridge, one of the founders of the SCP, to find out why the team came together to, in essence, do Bethesda's work for them, and ask whether they've ever had any contact with Bethesda. I came away from our chat with a deeper appreciation for the project, which is more than just a simple effort to improve the experience of Starfield. It's a collaborative effort between several modders and players to create a truly community-owned, open-source project, with standard practices of software development in place.\r\n \nRead more",

This new World of Warcraft story arc is set to play out across multiple expansions over the next few years, starting with The War Within - WoW's tenth expansion - in 2024.\r\n\n\r\nThe War Within takes players into heart of Azeroth itself, where they'll explore new subterranean kingdoms, engage with ancient cultures like the Earthen Dwarves - a new Allied race - and the terrifying Nerubians of Azj-Kahet. Azj-Kahet is one of several new zones coming in the expansion, alongside the Isle of Dorn, The Ringing Deeps, and Hallowfall.\r\n \nRead more",

As per studio Poncle's latest development update, a new story driven, lore-infused Adventures mode will soon be on the way.\r\n\n\r\nPoncle has teased Adventures before, describing them as a remix of content adding a bit of extra \"flavour\" through new stage progression and descriptions. Now though, via the medium of FAQ it's gone into considerably more detail, explaining Adventures are essentially self-contained miniature story campaigns - some available as part of the base game, others tied to specific DLC - that'll follow the game's cast of Survivors on a series of \"wacky sidequests.\"\r\n\n\r\nAdventures unlock at set points during the main game or their associated DLC, and feature a unique progression path that'll see players starting from scratch (main game unlocks won't be affected) using a specific character and item set-up as they attempt to complete a series of custom challenges with a limited arsenal. Those challenges might, for instance, require players to survive a certain amount of time or kill a set amount of enemies, and there'll be bits of lore text forming a mini story arc along the way.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is almost upon us (its campaign early access is upon us for those eager enough to have pre-ordered the game), and system requirements are pointing to an absolutely behemoth install size of more than 200GB in some cases come its full launch next Friday, 10th November - and Activision has now moved to explain what's going on.\r\n\n\r\nIn a statement shared on social media, the publisher blamed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's potentially massive hard drive footprint on an \"increased amount of content available Day 1\", which includes open world Zombies, support for items being carried forward from Modern Warfare 2, plus map files for the current the Call of Duty: Warzone.\r\n\n\r\nThe good news for anyone staring at their dwindling gigabytes like they're modelling for Munch's The Scream is that Modern Warfare 3 appears to offer a decent amount of control over exactly which bits are and are not installed. \"You can manage your Call of Duty files in the 'manage files' section of the COD HQ launcher menu,\" Activision notes. \"This includes the ability to uninstall specific content you are not actively playing.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Bloomberg later reported around 100 employees - approximately eight percent of Bungie's 1200-strong workforce - were affected by the job cuts, and that the layoffs followed internal warnings that studio revenue was 45 percent below projections due to a \"sharp drop\" in the popularity of Destiny 2.\r\n\n\r\nFurther reports have continued to paint a bleak picture of Destiny 2's fortunes; pre-orders for The Final Shape are said to be disappointing, while \"good\" rather than \"great\" feedback has reportedly lead management to delay the expansion from February to June next year.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Payday 3 hasn't exactly had the smoothest of launches; matchmaking issues, online-only requirements, and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system immediately soured its arrival for players back in September, and a highly anticipated first patch promising \"200+\" quality of life improvements has been repeatedly delayed. Finally though, after much waiting, the heist-shooter's 1.01 update is here on all platforms.\r\n\n\r\nPayday 3's 1.01 update was initially planned to launch on 5th October, but developer Starbreeze delayed its release to mid-October in order to \"ensure its stability\". After weeks of silence, the developer re-emerged to announced another, this time indefinite delay, explaining it had \"identified some issues that need to be fixed\".\r\n\n\r\nAs the wait has dragged on, Payday 3 player numbers have slumped to the low thousands, with the game's predecessor currently pulling in ten times more than the new version. As such, Starbreeze will doubtless be hoping the long-awaited arrival of 1.01 today will help reverse the game's fortunes. And it's a big one too, weighing in at 2GB (on PC, at least) and spanning an enormous number of improvements and changes.\r\n \nRead more",

EA and Maxis describe this new location as a \"scenic world nestled in a lush tropical landscape and vibrant city skyline\". It does look rather nice, I have to say.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile, as you will be - in the Sims team's words - closer than ever, this will mean bumping into neighbours left, right and centre. When you collect your post, they will be there. When you join in with a potluck meal event, they will be there. When you head out for a run, they will be there. In short, there will definitely be a lot more happening in your immediate vicinity when this pack goes live.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Developer Rovio has said it is now blocking a \"disturbing\" pro-Israel ad featuring graphic content after a Reuters report highlighted its discovery in Angry Birds and a number of other family orientated games.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to Reuters, the pro-Israel ad - created by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of an \"advocacy drive\" amid the continuing Israel-Hamas war - featured images of Hamas militants, rocket attacks, terrified Israeli families, explosions, and blurred graphic footage, culminating in the message, \"We will make sure that those who harm us pay a heavy price.\"\r\n\n\r\nSpeaking to Reuters, an Israeli government official confirmed the ads were part of a $1.5m USD campaign but insisted advertisers had been instructed to block the advert \"for people under 18\". Despite these instructions, Reuters said it had documented six cases – in Britain, France, Austria, Germany, and Holland – where the adverts had been served in games for children or families.\r\n \nRead more",

The slump is said to be the result of a \"sharp drop\" in the popularity of Destiny 2, with Bungie CEO Pete Parsons having reportedly highlighted weak player retention at the time.\r\n\n\r\nIn that same meeting, according to Bloomberg sources in attendance, Parsons told employees that Destiny 2's next expansion, The Final Shape - which concludes the game's current Light and Darkness saga - was only getting \"good\" rather than \"great\" feedback. As such, management was planning to delay its release to improve the product.\r\n \nRead more",

In its original guise, it specialised in porting arcade games over to the likes of Game Boy Colour and PlayStation; that emulation work has continued in the years since despite organisational changes, first as it become Backbone Entertainment following a merger in 2003, and again after the Digital Eclipse brand was purchased and revived by former employees in 2015.\r\n\n\r\nIn more recent times, the studio's emulation work has included the Blizzard Arcade Collection, Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, but last year's interactive digital documentary Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration - which blended new video interviews, archival material, and playable games to form an exhaustive record of Atari's history - was particularly well-recieved. The studio then launched its Gold Master Series earlier this year, taking a similarly thorough approach to individual classic games, starting with the acclaimed The Making of Karateka.\r\n \nRead more",

Crucially, the cross-progression migration process is both automatic and mandatory, meaning there's a fair amount those who play across multiple platforms will likely want to know in preparation.\r\n\n\r\nFor starters, players who've accrued different progress levels across multiple platforms will soon have all that smushed together into a single account. Respawn will generate the stats of this new account based on what it's calling a player's \"primarily platform\" - that is, the one with the highest level reached across all platforms. Stats/progress of all other accounts will be lost.\r\n \nRead more",

The massive in-game storm at Storm Point has now cleared the map and things look a little different to how we remember it, meaning there's plenty of new areas to explore as you fight to survive.\nFirst off, let's talk about brand new Legend Conduit. We now know more about her abilities, as well as how she came to get her equipment and suit. Conduit began as a fan of Apex Legends and is now stoked to be part of the Apex Games themselves - but she didn't join just for fame or fun, as she's got a family to take care of. She's described as having a good sense of humour and being fascinated with the tech used in the games.\nAn interesting fact for any Titanfall fans is that Conduit uses a radioactive battery from a modified Monarch Titan to power her suit and gadgets. She went exploring on a highly-radiated battlefield and came across the battery. She then stole it and uses it to take her place in the Apex Games - but at a cost. The battery itself is poisoning Conduit, and though we're not sure how this will impact her story as we move ahead, we're a bit worried about her long-term chances.\n Read more",

Well, would you believe it, there's a game just for you; it's called Still Wakes the Deep and first gameplay has just debuted.\r\n\n\r\nAnnounced back in June, Still Wakes the Deep is the latest from developer The Chinese Room - previously responsible for the likes of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Dear Esther - whisking players to the Beira D oil rig off the Scottish coast circa 1975.\r\n\n\r\nWhat follows is a narrative-focused first-person horror adventure in which players, in the role of an off-shore oil rig worker suddenly cut off from the outside world, must \"run, climb, and swim through the flooding corridors and storm-lashed outer decks\" as they attempt to evade an unspeakable otherworldly forces that's invited itself onboard.\r\n \nRead more",

Its sequel, 2014's Velocity 2X, retained the acclaimed ship-bound action of the original, but paired it with regular on-foot sections requiring protagonist to Lieutenant Kai Tana to disembark and solve a few puzzles to clear the way forward. Eurogamer liked it a lot!\r\n\n\r\nBut back to Ikaro: Will Not Die; it's being billed as an action-adventure rogue-lite, that \"brings the pace and precision of [the Velocity series'] satisfying flow-state action into third-person, while infusing an array of exciting new systems and mechanics.\"\r\n \nRead more",

However, developer Wildcard has announced a further delay for the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions, with both now due to arrive some time in November.\r\n\n\r\nThere has, of course, been a fair bit of controversy surrounding Ark: Survival Ascended since its announcement back in April this year; its reveal came with the news that Wildcard would be taking Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers offline when the remake arrived, forcing players to upgrade to the new version if they wanted to stay put. \r\n\n\r\nIt didn't help, either, that the remake was initially only available as part of a bundle with the now-delayed Ark 2, and while Wildcard eventually scrapped those plans, it instead decided to release a standalone version of Ark: Survival Ascended that was - amazingly - exactly the same price as the original bundle, despite featuring one less game. However, that price recently fell by $5 to $44.99 after Wildcard reversed plans to include a remake of Ark's Scorched Earth expansion alongside the base map, which it said would no longer be ready for launch.\r\n \nRead more",

And if your nerves are up to the challenge, the Halloween Update launches today.\r\n\n\r\nFrictional's creative lead Fredrik Olsson began teasing a hardcore Shell Shock mode last month, detailing a few of the sadistic features it would bring, but with it now here as part of today's Halloween Update, the studio has provided a little more information on what's in store.\r\n\n\r\nFor starters, as previously confirmed, The Bunker's Admin Office will no longer be the safe haven it once was in Shell Shock mode; its reassuringly sturdy steel doors are replaced with wood, meaning, yes, the monster can get in. And speaking of that pursuing horror, Shell Shock mode gives it new behaviours designed to increase its unpredictability.\r\n \nRead more",

Additionally, money raised through spectator tickets and entry fees, capped at £18/€20 and £14/€15 a person respectively, must not exceed the costs of organising the tournament and raising prize money - although prize money (limited to a total of £4,500/€5,000) also cannot be generated from spectator ticket sales.\r\n \nRead more",
