He describes one project that &#8220;got further than anyone else&#8221;: Helium. He&#8217;s right, as long as you ignore the fact that Helium was providing LoRaWAN, not Internet, that by the time he was writing his book Helium hotspots had long since passed the phase where they might generate even enough tokens for their operators to merely break even, and that the network was pulling in somewhere around $1,150 in usage fees a month despite the company being valued at $1.2 billion. Oh, and that the company had widely lied to the public about its supposed big-name clients, and that its executives have been accused of hoarding the project&#8217;s token to enrich themselves.

Section 2 canvasses the different fields of law (warranty, negligence, products liability, and certification) that could provide a starting point for what would have to be legislative action establishing a system of software liability. The conclusion is that all of these fields would face the same question: How buggy is too buggy? Section 3 explains why existing software development frameworks do not provide a sufficiently definitive basis for legal liability. They focus on process, while a liability regime should begin with a focus on the product&#8212;­that is, on outcomes. Expanding on the idea of building codes for building code, Section 4 shows some examples of product-focused standards from other fields. Section 5 notes that already there have been definitive expressions of software defects that can be drawn together to form the minimum legal standard of security. It specifically calls out the list of common software weaknesses tracked by the MITRE Corporation under a government contract. Section 6 considers how to define flaws above the minimum floor and how to limit that liability with a safe harbor...</p></blockquote>",

If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety...</p></blockquote>",

Another way is for one person to divide the piece, and the other person to complain (to the police, a judge, or his parents) if he doesn&#8217;t think it’s fair. This also works, but still requires another person&#8212;­at least to resolve disputes. A third way is for one person to do the dividing, and for the other person to choose the half he wants.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The point is that unlike protocols that require a neutral third party to complete (arbitrated), or protocols that require that neutral third party to resolve disputes (adjudicated), self-enforcing protocols just work.

Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.</p>\n<p>Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "<p>Okay, so this is weird. Zelle has been using my name, and my voice, in audio podcast ads&#8212;without my permission. At least, I think it is without my permission. It&#8217;s possible that I gave some sort of blanket permission when speaking at an event. It&#8217;s not likely, but it is possible.</p>\n<p>I wrote to Zelle about it. Or, at least, I wrote to a company called <a href=\"https://www.earlywarning.com/\">Early Warning</a> that owns Zelle about it. They asked me where the ads appeared. This seems odd to me. Podcast distribution networks drop ads in podcasts depending on the listener&#8212;like personalized ads on webpages&#8212;so the actual podcast doesn&#8217;t matter. And shouldn&#8217;t they know their own ads? Annoyingly, it seems time to get attorneys involved...</p>",

The STJV had called for action at the start of this month, saying annual salary negotiations had reached an unsatisfactory conclusion.\r\n\n\r\n\"In recent weeks,\" the STJV wrote in a statement shared at the time, \"Mandatory Annual Negotiations on salaries have taken place in several Ubisoft entities in France, and the STJV was obviously present.

The report is based on development sources now targeting that quarter for launch.\r\n\n\r\nEurogamer has heard similar whispers of an early 2025 launch from industry sources this week, though has not been able to concretely substantiate them. Nintendo Switch 2 had previously been widely tipped to arrive later this year. A move to the other side of Christmas into early 2025 would mean more time for the console's launch line-up to be readied, while keeping the financial benefit of Switch 2's launch within Nintendo's upcoming financial calendar. \n Read more",

A Disco Elysium sequel was reportedly cancelled in 2022 (complicating the claim, ZA/UM CEO was still talking about the project in June 2023, albeit saying it had been \"jeopardised\" following a messy tussle with its former creative leads), while a new sci-fi IP is said to have been paused in 2023.\r\n\n\r\nGLHF, citing \"sources close to the matter\", says 24 employees at ZA/UM are now at risk of redundancy following X7's cancellation, with the job losses mostly affecting \"the X7 team but also [its] non-development teams and non-X7 projects.\" Redundancies are set to impact employees in ZA/UM's UK offices as well as its EU studio, with writers, engineers, artists, animators, and staff in production and IT all affected. \r\n \nRead more",

The store will be open at the venue from 10am to 8pm every day except Sunday, when it's set to close at 4pm.\r\n\n\r\nPrevious Pokémon Center pop-ups in the UK have attracted huge crowds, and The Pokémon Company is clearly expecting similar attention this time around. It notes that while entry to the store is open to the general public and won't require a competitor or spectator badge, reservations are mandatory - even for badged attendees. More information on the reservation process is set to be shared \"closer to the event\". \r\n \nRead more",

A lavishly designed \"saga for the ages\", is what Eurogamer called it back in 2020.\r\n\n\r\nValhalla is joined by the developer Criterion's equally recommended arcade racer Need for Speed Unbound - the \"best Need for Speed in a generation\" we said when it released in 2022 - as well as Obsidian Entertainment's slightly less gripping 2019 satirical adventure The Outer Worlds, a \"conventional, easygoing scifi RPG...that fades very quickly from the mind.\" And here's the full list of February's PlayStation Plus Extra games.\r\n \nRead more",

Several Vitiligo patterns will have \"more than one variant\", the Sims team said, calling skin details an \"important area of focus for the dev team as we remain committed to expanding representation in The Sims 4\".

Ceruledge also makes a sneaky appearance towards the beginning of the video, as a projection onto the sides of some buildings. \n Read more",

The Canadian programmer had worked as part of a larger hacking group known as Team Xecuter, which in turn made millions from the sale of devices which enabled pirated video games to be played on a number of Nintendo's consoles. At the time of his sentence, Bowser pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, as well as an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo's own civil lawsuit against him.\nBowser was subsequently released from prison last year, however he will remain in debt to Nintendo for decades to come.

Patch 7, as last week's update is officially known, includes an Anniversary T-Shirt Bundle containing new clothing for Chai to wear. Four of these designs are available to everyone, while three are exclusive to the platform - Xbox, Steam, or the Epic Games Store - players own the game on.

It promises plenty of stealth and a good dash of combat, with the developer stating this will be the \"most immersive\" Metro experience to date. \r\n\n\r\nYou will play as Serdar in Metro Awakening. Serdar is \"a doctor and a rationalist\" in search of medication for his wife. This search will take players to the tunnels beneath Moscow, but it won't be an easy trip. You see, the tunnels are full of mutants.  \"As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become...\" the official blurb teases.

As she investigates the mysterious mark on her hand limiting her powers, she receives a tip-off leading her to a warehouse and a vampire known as Willem who might just have some answers.\r\n \nRead more",

Quite a lot, actually. Sony itself has said to expect \"guest appearances from some of the most talented minds in gaming\" - and without an invitation ourselves we can only assume this means Hideo Kojima. It's high time we heard more about Death Stranding 2. But who else might also qualify? Our money's on BioShock creator Ken Levine, whose long-awaited Judas is now finally nearing release.\n Read more",

          "description": "It's been five months since Paradox Interactive's surprise announcement Everybody's Gone to the Rapture developer The Chinese Room had taken the reins of its troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2; in that time, the studio has been openly discussing its approach to the sequel, with its latest update now focusing on what it's calling \"visceral immersive combat\".\r\n\n\r\nIn a newly shared blog post, creative director Alex Skidmore outlines three main gameplay styles the studio wants accommodate on release, each emphasising or de-emphasising combat in different ways. The first is what it calls the Strategic Stalker, a take on the \"vampire predator fantasy\" where the focus is on staying hidden and using the element of surprise.\r\n\n\r\nThis stealth-focused approach to combat, says Skidmore, is all about sneaking up on an enemy, causing a distraction, then feeding on them quickly before a fight can occur. That's in stark contrast to combat style number two - the Action Brawler - which is for players that want to get stuck straight into a fight using \"fast reflexes and combat skills\".\r\n \nRead more",

These include an exclusive pose and face paint for Photo Mode, plus five items that can be unlocked by progressing through the story: the Carja Behemoth Elite outfit and Short Bow, the Nora Thunder Elite outfit and Sling, the Apex Clawstrider Machine Strike piece, and a resources pack containing ammunition, potions, and travel packs.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss today's statement from The Pokémon Company that confirms it will investigate Palworld for possible intellectual property infringement. \nIt's an unprecedented move by Pokémon to publicly call out Palworld as a game worthy of inspection - after 25 years of rip-offs and clones that have been quietly nuked or ignored. But it also feels inevitable, due to Palworld's enormous spike in interest - seen by its Steam success, and also the sizable controversy swirling around it. The game had simply become too big to ignore.\nSo, what happens next? On the one hand, you'd think The Pokémon Company would be keen to act if any evidence of infringement can be found - it has to protect its intellectual property, or risk even cheekier Pokémon-style games trying harder in future. On the other, this announcement only feeds the controversy wave Palworld is riding, and risks blowback on Pokémon if the genuinely popular Palworld is unceremoniously removed from millions of people's Steam libraries. With me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy. \n Read more",

That jump can be directly attributed to the arrival of Grand Theft Auto on Netflix, with Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas all joining the streaming service in their Definitive Edition guises on 14th December last year.\r\n\n\r\nAs per Appmagic's figures, San Andreas was by far the most popular game among Netflix subscribers, and was downloaded 11.6m times. That's compared to 4.1m downloads for Vice City and 2.4m for GTA 3. Combined, that accounts for 18.1m downloads, meaning a further 10m downloads in December came from non-GTA games. That's approximately the same number of downloads Netflix generated in November, according to Appmagic.\r\n \nRead more",

But no, the studio has now reemerged with a lengthy statement blaming the whole thing on a \"hate campaign\" orchestrated by \"certain bloggers\".\r\n\n\r\nIt's not entirely clear why the anonymous voice behind Fntastic's social media account has chosen now to resurface and defend the supposedly defunct studio, but its newly published tweet offers a lenghty, ten paragraph rebuttal to what it calls \"a lot of misinformation... on the internet from supposedly anonymous sources.\"\r\n\n\r\nThe Day Before - at one time Steam's most wishlisted game - finally launched into Steam early access last December, following repeated (and sometimes bizarre) delays and frequent accusations it was a scam. Almost immediately, it was hit by complaints it bore little resemblance to the open-world zombie MMO promised in its striking 2021 reveal trailer, and with Steam reviews soon tipping into Overwhelmingly Negative, Fntastic suddenly announced it was shutting down just four days later, saying it had \"failed financially\".\r\n \nRead more",

It's a very hands-on kind of thing - each day you manually collect trash, wash and fold clothes, and unclog the toilet in first-person as you strive for greater front-of-shop efficiency and gradually expand your arcade empire - so it's a pretty natural fit for VR, where the whole immersive draw is getting to enthusiastically manipulate your virtual surroundings (and then throw something at a wall).\r\n\n\r\nIn Arcade Paradise VR, you can toss, rub, scrub, load, and clean using natural motions, then get stuck into those arcade games when not working your virtual fingers to the bone. Nosebleed's VR adaptation of Arcade Paradise features 39 playable cabinets, 27 of which have been carried across from the original - which featured a whole range of completely new, beautifully realised arcade games inspired by retro classics - plus 12 specific to VR.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As Fortnite continues its apparent mission to feature all other video games within itself in some capacity (until presumably it then puts itself in itself, including all other video games within), developer Epic Games has revealed Solid Snake isn't the only Metal Gear characer joining the battle royale line-up - with Raiden also set to appear as a new premium skin.\r\n\n\r\nFortnite, which is currently a month into Chapter 5 Season 1, released its first major update of the year - officially known as 28.10, number fans - earlier today. It includes new Bonus Reward styles for it Battle Pass skins, and, more notably, unlocks the ability to earn the previously announced Solid Snake Battle Pass skin and themed cosmetics by completing in-game quests.\r\n\n\r\nAs is often the case, a range of new store-bound premium cosmetics were also squirrelled away in today's update, and all ten were swiftly unearthed and shared by dataminers - including one depicting Solid Snake's Metal Gear pal Raiden. And the latter has now been given an official welcome to Fortnite in Epic's Solid Snake promotional trailer, which features Raiden sporadically de-camouflaging throughout.\r\n \nRead more",

Ultimately, those ambitious plans were scaled back significantly following Cyberpunk's disastrous launch, finally fizzling out altogether - but with player sentiment around the franchise now considerably higher in light of last year's acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion, it's notable the studio could be looking to revive its multiplayer ambitions for a second outing.\r\n \nRead more",

But there was also the brilliant-looking Hellblade 2, the eye-catching sequel from Ninja Theory we've been looking forward to for years. \nThen there's Avowed, a fantasy RPG to satisfy those waiting patiently for the next Elder Scrolls and who might prefer a bit more colour to their role-playing than in Starfield. Finally, we saw Visions of Mana from Square Enix and Ara: History Untold for PC. But was this enough to make for a satisfying show - and more importantly, set the tone for what is hopefully a better year of Xbox first-party launches than in 2023? I'm joined by Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan to discuss. \n Read more",

They were Cortana in the act, if you will. \r\n\n\r\nWhile the intercorse itself wasn't actually shown, with the two lovers merely seen touching scars and so on before waking up in bed together, it is very heavily implied.
