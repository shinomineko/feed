In the evaluation process, a numeric score between 0 and 10 is calculated, 10 being the most severe (critical) value. The goal of CVSS is to provide comparable scores across different evaluators. However, previous works indicate that CVSS might not reach this goal: If a vulnerability is evaluated by several analysts, their scores often differ. This raises the following questions: Are CVSS evaluations consistent? Which factors influence CVSS assessments? We systematically investigate these questions in an online survey with 196 CVSS users. We show that specific CVSS metrics are inconsistently evaluated for widespread vulnerability types, including Top 3 vulnerabilities from the &#8221;2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses&#8221; list. In a follow-up survey with 59 participants, we found that for the same vulnerabilities from the main study, 68% of these users gave different severity ratings. Our study reveals that most evaluators are aware of the problematic aspects of CVSS, but they still see CVSS as a useful tool for vulnerability assessment. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for inconsistent evaluations and provide recommendations on improving the consistency of scoring...</p></blockquote>",

Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, Jason, Mike Myers, Pinhead, Chucky, Jigsaw, and Ghostface all showed up in Boon's image, with a collection of either ticks or question marks across their faces. \r\n\n\r\nMany have surmised this means these less than friendly faces will soon be making their way into Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the game's DLC. As one fan noted in the replies, \"Jigsaw would be perfect with the new Saw coming out\".\r\n \nRead more",

After numerous leaks, Aspyr and Sony officially revealed their remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was in development back in 2021. At this time, it was announced the Star Wars game was being remade \"from the ground up\", and would launch as a timed console exclusive for PlayStation 5, and also for PC.\r\n\n\r\nSince then, news on the remake has been less than optimistic. In May 2022, Aspyr's parent company Embracer announced that Evil Dead developer Saber Interactive had joined up with Aspyr to work on the remake. Then, in July, it was reported that the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake was \"in serious trouble\" and \"delayed indefinitely\". \r\n \nRead more",

Sony has seen huge sales successes, of course, but is this down to the company's continued direction or simply an open goal from the last console generation? \nAnnounced just before we recorded this week's show, we also discuss the shock cancellation of Hyenas, the loot shooter from Sega's UK studio Creative Assembly that was being demoed to the public only last month. Such a last-minute scrubbing of a game launch is startling - we discuss why the decision may have been made.\n Read more",

Developer Mintrocket has just unveiled its next project, titled Nakwon: Last Paradise, and it's about as much a departure from its acclaimed snorkelling-and-sushi-restaurant-management adventure as you can get, dropping players onto the streets of Seoul, right into the middle of the undead apocalypse.\r\n\n\r\nAs per Mintrocket's lengthy Steam announcement, Nakwon's action is split into two main parts; on the Scouting side, players - with a friend in tow if desired - must leave the relative comforts of the titular safe zone to venture into the zombie-infested outskirts of Seoul. Here, the goal is to scavenge resources then escape back to safety, but other players and, of course, the AI-controlled undead, won't make that an easy task. \r\n\n\r\nMintrocket stresses that zombies in Nakwon are very much the hunters, and cannot be defeated. Instead, players - primarily armed with makeshift weaponry and tools rather than undead-shredding firepower, given the scarcity of guns - must navigate the streets as stealthily as possible to avoid detection, fleeing when necessary. And should they successfully make it back to the safe zone alive (it looks like players can come and go as they like, regardless of what other Survivors might be doing) the Simulation side of Nakwon begins.\r\n \nRead more",

It's set in an alternate version of Earth's 1992 where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data.\r\n\n\r\nEnter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before sailing off into the sunset with his boyfriend Alex.

Lara has returned from her travels in South America, having prevented an apocalypse of some description, and is now ready for her next adventure. \r\n\n\r\nNetflix's debut trailer is quite brief, featuring a lot of heavy breathing from our heroine over the top of a handful of impactful shots. We get to see Lara abseiling into a cavernous abyss and - perhaps in homage to one of Shadow of the Tomb Raider's better moments - emerging onto the scene while a backdrop of flames silhouettes her (presumably) rather battle weary figure. There is also a nice little nod to the Yamatai crew from the 2013 reboot, with Lara tenderly stroking a photo of her fallen friends (although, no Alex? And, I know Jonah is still alive).\r\n \nRead more",

I am assuming this will convert to roughly £55 here in the UK, but have emailed Sony to ask for clarification. \r\n\n\r\nThe Complete Edition will then be available for PC players via Steam and Epic Game Store sometime in early 2024. This version is being handled by Nixxes Software, which was also responsible for this year's Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart PC release.\r\n \nRead more",

Croteam is promising new abilities, including gravity manipulation and mind transference, on top of the mechanics seen in the first game, and it'll all take place across \"more than a dozen\" new environments - said to be hiding long-buried secrets and forgotten history - that range from a city on the brink of a paradigm shift to the landscapes of a mysterious island.\r\n \nRead more",

However, it was recently announced that a tentative agreement has been reached between the relevant parties for a new three-year contract, something that looks set to end the 146-day strike (thanks, Variety). \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ten days after Unity successfully enraged huge swathes of the development community by announcing sweeping, and wildly unpopular, changes to its Unity Engine business model, the company has said it's \"sorry\" and walked back on significant aspects of its new pricing plan.\r\n\n\r\nLast Tuesday, Unity announced that, as of 1st January 2024, developers would be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install on top of their existing licence subscription after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash was immediate and intense, resulting in minor revisions to Unity's initial plan.\r\n\n\r\nNow though, Unity's Marc Whitten has outlined significant changes to last week's announcement in a post on the company's website, beginning with another apology. \"I want to start with this: I am sorry,\" he wrote. \"We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback before announcing our new Runtime Fee policy. Our goal with this policy is to ensure we can continue to support you today and tomorrow, and keep deeply investing in our game engine.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Creative Assembly says all affected customers should receive an email confirming this cancellation directly from the Epic Games Store support team.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Valve has once again dropkicked the dreams right out of anyone hoping a whizzier, more powerful Steam Deck might be happening soon; it's now provided a clearer timeframe for what it considers to be the current Steam Deck's minimum life span, saying not to expect any kind of performance upgrade \"in the next couple of years\".\r\n\n\r\nValve has, of course, tempered expectations for a souped-up Steam Deck sequel previously; in December, Deck designer Pierre-Loup Griffais said the company would likely keep a single performance spec, ie. the current one, for its handheld gaming PC \"a little bit longer\", noting any initial hardware improvements would probably focus on screen and battery capacity.\r\n\n\r\nBut now, speaking to The Verge, Griffais has indicated that \"little bit\" will likely be a lot longer, and that any Steam Deck performance upgrades are still some considerable way off. \"It's important to us that the Deck offers a fixed performance target for developers,\" he explained, \"and that the message to customers is simple, where every Deck can play the same games.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you cast your minds back to 2020, you may recall Spider-Man being a hot topic of conversation. This was not because he had just used his web-tastic athleticism to save a school bus of children from careering off the side of the road, or swept MJ off her feet (literally) before kissing her while upside down. \r\n\n\r\nRather, he was a topic of conversation because Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games remastered its original 2018 game for the PlayStation 5, and at the same time changed up the look of its unmasked hero, Peter Parker. \r\n\n\r\nWhile Insomniac said this new model was a better reflection of actor Yuri Lowenthal's facial capture, it caused a certain amount of upset for fans of the original. In fact, when the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man released last year, mods were made to bring Peter Parker's original face back into the game. But, perhaps we should all be less concerned about the two different facial models for Peter and move on. After all, that's what his actor wants. In fact, he just wants people to \"get over it\".\r\n \nRead more",

It does not appear to boast a bump in processing power - something that gels with what Xbox boss Phil Spencer told me at Gamescom last month - but also ditches the ability to play older games on disc. How does that square with Microsoft's push for game preservation?\nLooking further ahead, Microsoft has pinned 2028 as the year we'll finally see the Xbox Series X's proper successor arrive. Is that too late? And what does it mean that the console will support \"cloud hybrid\" games?\n Read more",

Its unique selling point, however, is that procedural generation governs virtually every aspect of it in a bid to create an endlessly replayable crime-solving caper - from the layout of its city streets to the schedules of its citizens, right through to the cases you'll need to solve through stealth, subtrefuge, and sleuthing.\r\n\n\r\nAnd from next Monday, 25th September, come the arrival of its Cheats and Liars update, Shadows of Doubt will have another trick in its toolbox - as players might just find themselves asked to investigate cases of infidelity, should it suit the procedural generation's whims.\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, several users have uploaded footage and screenshots showcasing the Switch version of the game - and the results aren't great. \r\n\n\r\nIn fact, the version available on Nintendo's hybrid console has been widely panned, with many wondering how the developer can ask the same price on Switch as on other platforms. \r\n\n\r\nFans have taken to the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok to question NetherRealm's decision to market Mortal Kombat 1 as a $70 Switch release. It has been called \"robbery\" and \"disrespectful\" to users.\r\n \nRead more",

Well then Sony might just, depending on your idea of tasteful, have what you're looking for: three new metallic console covers (and matching controllers) that are almost certainly not going to match your existing decor!\r\n\n\r\nSony's newly announced Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue, and Sterling Silver cover/controller combos are, according to a post on the PlayStation Blog, inspired by the \"beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth\" - all of which have then bee \"elevated\" with a metallic finish for a \"touch of sophistication.\"\r\n\n\r\nThose interested in giving their PS5 a \"Deep Earth\" makeover can, when the appropriate time comes, pick up each of the three shiny new covers for £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 USD, while the DualSense controllers (sold separately) will each cost £64.99/€74.99/$74.99 USD.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Frictional Games fans could be forgiven for thinking the horror-focused studio has been getting a little soft in recent years, having introduced death-free and monster-free modes in post-launch updates for its acclaimed SOMA and Amnesia: Rebirth. This year, though, it's going in completely the opposite direction, and its recently launched WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker will be getting even more nerve-frayingly horrifying, just in time for Halloween.\r\n\n\r\nAs spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun, Frictional's creative lead Fredrik Olsson has recently been using social media to detail some of the delightfully sadistic new features coming to Amnesia: The Bunker soon in what will known as Shell Shocked mode.\r\n\n\r\nFor starters, players who've been relying on the comparative tranquility of The Bunker's Admin Office safe room to emotionally, physically, and mentally regroup will, in Shell Shocked mode, be a little bit screwed. Now, its reassuringly sturdy steel doors will be replaced wood, which, you know, isn't all that resistant to scrambling, pounding, shredding monster claws.\r\n \nRead more",

It also brings changes to loot, items, and crafting, as well as UI and UX improvements, and a new selection of radio stations.\r\n\n\r\nIn other words, Cyberpunk's 2.0 update touches on a broad range of core systems in a significant fashion - and CD Projekt has been attempting to explain how these changes will impact the experience across a recent series of developer streams.\r\n \nRead more",

It's claimed this recent drop is due to underwhelming sales of Final Fantasy 16, though it also follows the disappointing Forspoken and a number of smaller games released at the tail-end of last year that failed to make much of an impression.\r\n\n\r\nBloomberg sources include current and former Square Enix employees who remain anonymous, but stated the company's approach is to give each project a single producer.\r\n \nRead more",

Either way, the important thing here is that no core game purchase will be required, and EA is also keen to add there'll be no subscription and no \"energy mechanics\" - so that's at least one predatory mobile monetisation tactic off the table.\r\n\n\r\nAs to what a new mainline Sims game designed from the ground-up to be free-to-play might look like, a Project Rene job listing hastily removed from EA's website earlier this year pointed to an in-game marketplace featuring official and user-generated content (both free and paid) - something else EA has now more or less confirmed.\r\n \nRead more",

Anyone whose revenue or funding was less than $100k over the course of the year (and who didn't want access to features such as the ability to remove the Unity splash screen) could stick to the free Unity Personal licence, while a Unity Plus subscription was required up to $200k in revenue, and a Unity Pro or above subscription was needed for more.\r\n\n\r\nAs of 1st January, 2024, however, developers will be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install - seemingly including re-installs and installs across multiple devices - on top of their existing licence subscription, with those fees kicking in for titles that have made $200k or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200k lifetime game installs. Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers, meanwhile, will see the fees applied after passing the $1m revenue and 1m lifetime installs threshold.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, guess what? Anything is possible in this darkest of timelines.\r\n\n\r\nThe official Xbox credit card will soon be a thing, albeit only in the US for the time being, having been conjured into existence through a partnership between Microsoft and Mastercard. It'll initially be available exclusively to Xbox Insiders (it's expected to expand to all US-based Xbox players starting next year) and offers one of those reward-based scheme things, which - and I'm not sure there's a nicer way of putting this - essentially incentivises people to increase their debt, so, you know, please use responsibly and all that.\r\n\n\r\nBasically, everyday purchases made on the card will steadily accrue points that can be spent on games and add-ons via Xbox.com, but an initial purchase using the card will also reward cardholders with 5,000 points (equating to $50 USD), plus three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Only new members are eligible for that three-month deal, incidentally, but it can be gifted to other people if you're already a Game Pass subscriber yourself.\r\n \nRead more",

Wikipedia also tells me the well-received game was originally planned to release on Super Nintendo, before getting the chop.\r\n\n\r\nAnyway, 28 years later, Gargoyles the game is returning in the form of Gargoyles Remastered, by Empty Clip Studios, featuring the ability to toggle between the original's wonderfully characterful 16-bit visuals and a new art style said to be inspired by the cartoon, but which, to my eyes at least, doesn't look to have anywhere near the same kind of charm.\r\n \nRead more",

Some of that takes the form of a brief - and by brief I mean barely five-seconds-long - in-game look at Van Damme, who appears around the 5:52 mark. To summarise, he pumps the air, flips the bird, and looks reasonably like a young Jean-Claude Van Damme.\r\n \nRead more",

The aforementioned \"potato mode\" is, alas, unlikely to fulfil all your wildest, possibily erotic potato-slaying fantasies, more likely being some under-the-hood changes Gunfire has made to push Remnant 2's settings below those previously allowed - hopefully meaning improved performance on lower-spec PCs.\r\n\n\r\nPerformance improvements have, of course, been a focus for Gunfire following Remnant 2's slightly wobbly launch, and Cureton's post makes it explicitly clear the incoming patch will include more. That comes alongside the introduction of toggle aim and hold sprint, \"dozens\" of enemy updates, material refund changes for weapon deconstruction, PlayStation icon selection, and proper EXP rewards for instances where Summons make the kills.\r\n \nRead more",

That means the likes of shorts, trunks, vests, sandals, and bathing suits, sporting, as EA puts it, a \"plethora of patterns, colors and trendy cuts\" designed to compliment a variety of skin tones and body shapes.\r\n\n\r\nFinishing touches come in the form of various aquatic accessories, including sunglasses, sandals, rainbow nails, floaties (including at least one rubber ring), and more.\r\n \nRead more",

There'd been some concern in the community, you might recall, that Minthara had been a victim of last-minute content cuts to meet Baldur's Gate 3's shifted deadline - but Larian had instead blamed her silence on a bug, promising an imminent fix, which, now here, should hopefully reinstate all missing Minthara content.\r\n\n\r\n\"This hotfix takes care of a bug that blocked access to some of Minthara’s lines of dialogue, including some hot takes from your companions about your decision to date the ruthless Oath of Vengeance Paladin,\" Larian explains in today's release notes. \"If approval is high enough, your romance with Minthara will progress in Act 3. This unlocks several new dialogues allowing you to explore and deepen the relationship, and discover more details of Minthara's backstory.

          "description": "Have you ever wondered why, when you're having a lovely stroll around the world of Baldur's Gate 3, there are so many bodies without heads lying around? No it's not because the inhabitants of the world have faulty necks - it's because developer Larian is doing something sneaky.\nYou see, offering people the ability to speak with any corpse via the spell Speak with Dead created a lot of work. It meant writers not only had to write lines for all the living people, but for the dead ones too. And okay, there's a limiting factor in how Speak with Dead only allows you to ask five questions, but that's still an array of questions to write answers for. And in a war-torn world filled with dead people... That's a lot of answers to write.\nWhat to do? Simple, albeit gruesome: cut their heads off. \"The trick that we use is [you can speak to] 'any dead that still has their head',\" Vincke told Wizards of the Coast interviewer Todd Kenreck, in a really lovely interview actually. \"So you will see a lot of decapitated people in the game - that's literally how we solved that.\"\n Read more",

          "description": "Paradox Interactive's medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is celebrating its three-year anniversary by trumpeting 3m copies sold since launch and by releasing a bunch of statistics gleaned in that time, suggesting players' conflict resolution skills may need some work - or at least, a little less of a preoccupation with murder.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to Paradox, a grand total of 50,159,539 murder schemes have been successfully carried out since Crusader Kings 3's arrival back in 2020. That's nearly 16m more murder plots than wedding celebrations, which currently sit at 34,480,042. And, of course, more than a few chaotic sorts have thoroughly muddied the waters between the two, with Paradox reporting a total of 7,790 bloody weddings have been msaterminded by players who cleary weren't going to let a bit of murder get in the way of anyone's big day - or possiby vice versa.\r\n\n\r\nParadox's other shared stats don't open up quite such a fascinating window on player behaviour, but we do know 1,325,198 grand tournaments have been bravely fought since launch, and 1,037,787 grand weddings have also been held. In total, player have amassed more than 317m hours in-game, with nearly 1.4m players having joined this year alone.\r\n \nRead more",

Soon, because this is very much one of those games, players become embroiled in a conspiracy involving ghouls, gangsters, cops, cultists, and, of course, a corporation run amok.\r\n\n\r\nIn more practical terms, that manifests as a side-scrolling action-platformer in which players take on the might of their foes using a brolly that's simultaneously a gun - enhanceable with munitions and upgrades fashioned from gathered scrap - plus a handy all-in-one shield.\r\n \nRead more",

Completing all objectives within a tier unlocks a new reward exclusive to the expedition and completing all tiers awards one final prize.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab certainly does.\r\n\n\r\nToday, the jet-loving team announced the Back to the Future collaboration for its beloved clean-it-up game (which is a bit of a Eurogamer favourite). FuturLab has said this DLC pack, which will retail at £6.49/$7.99/€7.99, will be a faithful homage to Marty and Doc's time travelling escapades. \r\n\n\r\nSo, what can you expect to clean on this DLC's release? Well, of course, you will have to get your watery-jets into every nook and cranny of the series' Time Machine. It really wouldn't be a Back to the Future collaboration without it.
