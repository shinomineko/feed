They are already being adopted in practice and integrated into many systems, including integrated development environments (IDEs) and search engines. The functionalities of current LLMs can be modulated via natural language prompts, while their exact internal functionality remains implicit and unassessable. This property, which makes them adaptable to even unseen tasks, might also make them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting. Recently, several ways to misalign LLMs using Prompt Injection (PI) attacks have been introduced. In such attacks, an adversary can prompt the LLM to produce malicious content or override the original instructions and the employed filtering schemes. Recent work showed that these attacks are hard to mitigate, as state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-following. So far, these attacks assumed that the adversary is directly prompting the LLM...</p></blockquote>",

To better support that use case, Kubernetes\nintroduced external admission control in\nv1.7.\nIn addition to countless custom, internal implementations, many open source projects and commercial\nsolutions implement admission controllers with user-specified policy, including\nKyverno and Open Policy Agent’s\nGatekeeper.\nWhile admission controllers for policy have seen adoption, there are blockers for their widespr…",

Movie (of course, there is also the chance parents have already shown the rap to their children - I certainly have). \r\n\n\r\nSeth Rogen, who voices Donkey Kong in the upcoming film, has revealed this iconic tune will be in the Super Mario Bros.

Link uses this to ride a rock that had fallen from the sky back up to where it came from. Here, he then glides on to one of Tears of the Kingdom's sky islands, where he comes across new enemies known as \"constructs\". \r\n\n\r\nThis trailer also gives us a look at the new weapon fusing mechanic. Link can add keese eyeballs to arrows to make homing arrows, and mushrooms to shields (yes, mushrooms to shields). When the shroom shield is struck by an advancing enemy, the mushroom creates a cloud of spores that engulfs the fight in a fog. This fusing technique can also be used to make vehicles like rafts from stray logs and fans, or even flying ships, thanks to the Ultrahand ability.\r\n \nRead more",

And while much has been redacted, it predominantly presents Microsoft's arguments around why its proposed 10-year deal with Sony to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation, and its signed agreements with Nvidia, should be sufficient to satisfy the CMA's concerns.\r\n\n\r\nAmong all this, though, is the nugget from Microsoft that 10 years should be ample time for Sony to whip up a Call of Duty competitor of its own - while glossing over the rather obvious fact Activision's shooter has had over 20 years to build the kind of brand recognition that's turned it into the juggernaut gaming franchise it is today.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "After a tiny tease last week, Paradox Interactive has properly unveiled Life by You, a new open-world life simulator that's launching into PC early access on 12th September.\r\n\n\r\nDeveloped by Paradox Tectonic - the studio headed by Rod Humble, former Sims boss and CEO of Second Life studio Linden Labs - Life by You's marketing immediately slings shade in the direction of The Sims 4, describing the title as a game that'll let players \"create humans and live out their lives without loading screens\".\r\n\n\r\nWhile the fundamentals - from house building to character creation - all seem very Sims-like, Paradox is trumpeting an \"open game world where everything is customisable\", alongside \"real language conversation\" and the ability for players to directly control their digital humans if they'd prefer something more hands-on than the default third-person view.\r\n \nRead more",

One month later, Nintendo confirmed its absence, saying, \"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis [and] this year's E3 show didn’t fit into our plans\".\r\n\n\r\nIt wasn't particularly surprising news, given Nintendo hasn't held a major E3 conference for over a decade now and last had a showfloor presence at E3 back in 2019, but there were hopes that this year's organiser (Eurogamer parent company Reedpop) might be able to coax the major players back in its attempts to revitalise a flagging formula - which, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, hasn't had an in-person component since 2019.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We already knew that Endnight's early access survival horror Sons of the Forest has been a big hit – it almost instantly blew up on Steam, and managed to sell \"over two million copies in the first 24 hours\" – but now that success is tipping over into its fan-favourite predecessor, too.\r\n\nAs detailed on the PS Blog, predecessor The Forest has seen a spike in player count, too, proving to be a favourite for players on Sony consoles as well as PC.\r\n\nWhilst the game has been, admittedly, consistently popular, since the release of Sons of the Forest, the prequel has catapulted back into PlayStation's Top 10 chart. According to Sony, it was the eighth most-downloaded PS4 game in the US/Canada in February, and the third most-downloaded in Europe, with only Minecraft and The Last of Us Part 2 proving more popular.\r\n \nRead more",

And that appears to be a mix of first-person gunplay and detective work.\r\n\n\r\n In the video, we see RoboCop patrolling the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit in search of a suspected drug trafficker. He's able to profile ne'er-do-wells using his fancy gadgetry as he makes his way to the likely scene of the crime - an arcade - and once inside, there's an opportunity to do a bit of scan-based detective work, where he uncovers evidence of drug use on the premises before bothering a potential informant at the urinal.\r\n \nRead more",

Now, though, it's saying it's dropping the price of Meta Quest 2's 256GB model from $499.99 USD to $429.99 in order to \"let even more people feel the joy of fully immersive games and experiences\".\r\n\n\r\nThe price drop goes into effect this Sunday in a select number of territories - specifically, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK, and the US - and will mean there's now only $40 price difference between the 128GB and 256GB models.

          "description": "Warframe's ambitious The Duviri Paradox expansion - which was originally slated to arrive last year before getting delayed into 2023 - is finally almost upon us, with developer Digital Extremes having now confirmed it'll be launching this April. And while you've got your diary out, it's also announced a date for this year's TennoCon so you might as well jot that down too.\r\n\n\r\nThe Duviri Paradox, if you've not been keeping up with the news, introduces Warframe's fourth open-world area - following the Plains of Eidolon, Orb Vallis, and the Cambrian Drift - and plunges players into the fantasy-western-themed world of Duviri, most notable for the fact it exists inside the mind of the expansion's new big bad, Dominus Thrax.\r\n\n\r\nBeyond its distinctive setting, The Duviri Paradox also features a striking stark black and white aesthetic (with the world slowly blooming into full colour over time), a new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees Digital Extremes \"flirting with rogue-like elements\", and, for good measure, a fancy skeletal horse steed.\r\n \nRead more",
