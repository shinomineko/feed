From there they can load arbitrary code on the targeted server and install malware or launch other attacks. Notably, hackers can introduce the snippet in seemingly benign ways, like by sending the string in an email or setting it as an account username...</p></blockquote>",

Brand name &#8220;air tags&#8221; are placed in out-of-sight areas of the target vehicles when they are parked in public places like malls or parking lots. Thieves then track the targeted vehicles to the victim’s residence, where they are stolen from the driveway.</p>\n<p>Thieves typically use tools like screwdrivers to enter the vehicles through the driver or passenger door, while ensuring not to set off alarms. Once inside, an electronic device, typically used by mechanics to reprogram the factory setting, is connected to the onboard diagnostics port below the dashboard and programs the vehicle to accept a key the thieves have brought with them. Once the new key is programmed, the vehicle will start and the thieves drive it away...</p></blockquote>",

When a replica is first created, the\nKubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist.

And now here's another massive figure for the record books: it's officially the first game to surpass one trillion views on YouTube.\nTo celebrate the immense milestone, YouTube has launched a new website highlighting the creators and videos that helped Minecraft reach 1,000,000,000,000 views over the last decade - a figure that would, as YouTube points out to put it into some kind of perspective, amount to over 30,000 years if each view equated to just one second of time.\nRead more",

          "description": "Tis the season of festive sales in video game land, and the Epic Games Store has now thrown open its shutters and bellowed news of its own discount offerings into the cold winter night, which includes the return of its daily \"mystery gift\" free games, starting with Shenmue 3.\nShenmue 3 is, of course, the long, long, long-awaited third instalment in developer Yu Suzuki's classic action-adventure series, which finally arrived in 2019 following a gap of 18 years between it and its predecessor. Picking up where Shenmue 2 left off, part 3 sees protagonist Ryo Hazuki resume his quest for vengeance after the murder of his father in the original, delivering a new chapter that Eurogamer's Martin Robison called both \"archaic and arcane\" and \"a worthy successor to what many consider an all-time great\" in his review.\nRead more",

It'll be published by Koch Media's Prime Matter division and there are a selection of new screenshots to tide people over until more solid release date news comes their way.\nIt has, of course, been a long and eventful road for the System Shock remake, which was originally intended to be a remaster of Looking Glass Technologies' cult-classic 1994 sci-fi horror before ballooning in scope. By the time its Kickstarter commenced in July 2016, Nightdive was calling it a \"reboot\" and, after a rocky period of development, the studio announced it was putting the project on hiatus after letting \"things get out of control\".\nRead more",
