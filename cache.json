Get It Together sees players controlling the WarioWare characters inside the mini-games. So we see Wario squeezing toothpaste out of a giant tube and peeling off a facemask and dodging bird poo, for example. Elsewhere, other WarioWare characters have new talents - 9Volt uses a yo-yo to turn the blades of a windmill in one game - and different characters will be able to use their own specific abilities to complete each challenge.\nThis idea comes into its own in a new two-player mode which sees players competing or collaborating on a single screen. The micro-games shown throughout the reveal were very classical Wario type experiences, with a lovely swipe-file mix of styles and production values. I can't wait.\nRead more",

It noted, however, that frame rates above 30fps are possible on TVs supporting variable refresh rates (VRR).\nOver on the official Flight Simulator's FAQ, meanwhile, most additional details provided aim to clarify questions around how the console edition will interact with the version already released on PC, and confirm, for instance, that those who own the Windows Store version on PC won't need to purchase the console edition again.\nRead more",

          "description": "At long last, we finally got a proper look at Elden Ring during Summer Games Fest last week, and all of a sudden we now have a flood of information about what to expect in the upcoming game. In an interview with IGN, legendary director Hidetaka Miyazaki gave plenty of information on the background lore, along with some discussion of abilities, multiplayer and the game's structure.\nOne of the first topics discussed was Elden Ring's setting, The Lands Between, which has been deliberately designed to give \"an enormous sense of scale and this broadness and openness\". It's split into six major areas, each of which is the domain of a demigod. These are lined up to suggest a specific order in which to tackle them, but the player can make their own decisions about which to do first. \"You won't be able to access everything from the start, but there are a lot of different ways you can approach each area,\" Miyazaki explained. \"And there's a lot of freedom as to which order you tackle different areas as well.\"\nPlayers will be able to access a hub area a little later in the game, which you can \"branch out from\", and also the six main areas of The Lands Between. \"These will be the domains or the areas of the main demigod bosses,\" Miyazaki explained. \"From here, you're able to explore not only these mainline dungeon areas, but also a wide variety of catacombs, castles, and fortresses, which are interspersed throughout the map. These have a range of scale and scope, but the main dungeons are these six - these are the ones that you're going to be heading to on your adventures throughout the main world. \"\nRead more",

Well, the developer is back with another sci-fi offering, although this time it's all taking place on a run-down space station. \nTitled Citizen Sleeper, the game was previously teased under the name Project Sidereal, but developer Jump Over The Age revealed the new name and trailer during last night's PC Gaming Show. It's described as \"roleplaying in the ruins of interplanetary capitalism,\" with the player taking the role of a \"sleeper\" - in other words, a digitised human consciousness. The bad news is that you're also owned by a huge corporation that wants you back, and your body will deteriorate as part of \"planned obsolescence\" for escapees. This what happens when billionaires start jetting themselves into space, I guess. \n\"Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle,\" the Steam description explains. \"Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom.\"\nRead more",

Or at least stab it in the face a few times until its head pops off. \"Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine,\" Square elaborates in its announcement, \"Yet doubts remain-are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?\".\nMay's rumours suggested the game would slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja's Nioh games and From Software's Souls series, albeit with a more accessible focus, and today's reveal appears to support that. Square is promising \"exhilarating, action-packed battles\" against iconic Final Fantasy monsters in a \"world of dark fantasy\".\nRead more",

          "description": "Platinum Games' long-awaited Square Enix title Babylon's Fall is now coming to PS5 as well as PS4 and PC. This was announced during Square Enix's E3 showcase this evening.\nThe game's also going live-service. The publisher treated audiences to a fairly brief trailer, featuring in-game footage of a frantic 3D action game with lots of armour and magical lightning and some decent operatic music. A follow-up developer interview revealed a game in which teams of players enjoy hack-and-slash combat and explore dungeons in groups of four. These dungeons are located on different floors of a giant tower, and end with a boss.\nRegular updates will allow for new moves that can be equipped as skills. There's a focus on character customisation and crafting, and a massive emphasis on builds, due to a \"Gideon coffin\" the characters wear that allows them to equip two additional weapons alongside the weapons they hold in their hands, and, I think, swing them about independently, a la Astral Chain. The game will ship with five weapon types, and there will be a website that allows players to tweak their builds while they're away from the game. \nRead more",

As part of its Geeked Week of reveals, Netflix teased a first look at things to come, and it's delivered exactly that - albeit limiting itself to just 12 seconds of footage.\nEven before the conclusion of The Witcher's well-received first season, Netflix confirmed an eventual return for Geralt, Jennefer, Ciri, and Jaskier (as played by Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, Freya Allan, and Joey Batey respectively).\nSince then, we've learned that the second season - which promises to dial back on the time-hopping antics of its predecessor - will usher in new cast members including Simon Callow as the Dorian detective Codringher, Silent Witness' Liz Carr as business partner Fenn, Bridgerton's Adjoa Andoh as priestess Nenneke, and Brave New World's Cassie Clare as Phillippa Eilhart, sorceress and advisor to King Vizimir.\nRead more",

Today brings answer: more Castlevania, but different.\nCastlevania's future on Netflix was left in doubt when the streaming service opted to wind up the series in its current guise after showrunner Warren Ellis departed from the show following allegations of sexual misconduct. However, subsequent rumours suggested a spin-off was in the works, and Netflix has now made that official.\nWith Castlevania's current run now concluded, Netflix is working on a brand-new series that will take Richter Belmont (son of original series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - both familiar characters to game fans - to 1792 France for an adventure that unfolds against the backdrop of the French Revolution.\nRead more",

Kennedy once again serving as the US president's bodyguard - which would probably seem like a walk in the park compared to his usual adventures if it wasn't for the threat of an imminent zombie outbreak.\nClaire Redfield also plays a role in Leon's latest adventure, embarking on her own investigation as (the supposedly canon) events unfold, and if you're curious to see how proceedings kick off, you can do that via the first three minutes of the show below.\nRead more",

You'll unlock perks and weapons and \"new ways to play you can share with your team\", said Keighley.\nDespite the theme, Anacrusis looks like a very bright and upbeat game.

          "description": "Earlier this year, developer Iron Gate released a pretty ambitious roadmap for Valheim that included several major updates and a host of smaller improvements: but as the months passed, it began to seem less and less likely that Iron Gate would meet all these targets. Sure enough, the Iron Gate team has confirmed that it's had to revise its roadmap for 2021 - and that includes a trimmed-down version of its update schedule. \n\"As we're sure lots of you suspected, we won't be able to deliver four updates this year,\" Iron Gate explained in an update post on Steam. \"Instead, we're now planning to launch Hearth and Home in Q3 2021, and we're temporarily taking down the roadmap whilst we make some changes. We are sorry it's taken us so long to update you.\"\nIron Gate went on to explain that it hadn't been prepared for \"such a large influx of players\", and the game's popularity highlighted plenty of bugs that needed urgent fixes. \"Our priority has been to make the current experience as stable as possible and this has meant new content has taken a backseat. To put it clearly; we haven't been able to focus all of our resources on Hearth and Home until May.\nRead more",

Players took to Reddit to document these machines of terror, pointing out that they were behaving like cheaters. Those who spectated the bots or replayed death cams discovered they effectively had wall hacks and aimbot enabled, with the bots spinning around to obliterate players with unnerving speed and accuracy. \n\"They're 'aim bots' now and that's no joke,\" said appropriately-named Reddit user Morbidly Tortured. \"I got taken out by a bot from 200 meters out.

          "description": "After a string of rumours, whispers and leaks EA has finally lifted the veil of the latest Battlefield, seeing the flagship first-person shooter moving away from the historical setting of recent entries to a near-future backdrop - with this year's model subsequently called Battlefield 2042. In a break from other recent traditions, it'll also do away with a single-player campaign, and there are no plans for an accompanying battle royale mode.\nBattlefield 2042 will instead focus on its multiplayer offering, supporting 128 players on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game support 64 players. There will also be the option of playing against AI bots, either solo or with a squad of friends. \n\"I think that's just something that enables us to really lean into what we are best at,\" Battlefield 2042 design director Daniel Berlin told Eurogamer about the lack of a single-player campaign - something that's been a series mainstay since Battlefield 3. \"If you look at the DNA of the studio, what we've been doing for so long, we just said you know what, we're not going to have a traditional single-player campaign this time around, but we're going to put all that emphasis and all those resources into building depth into the multiplayer.

          "description": "We're still waiting for that big Heath and Home update, but in the meantime developer Iron Gate has rolled out another small patch to fix some of Valheim's bugs. This patch makes two previously-bugged raid events actually trigger in-game, and provides a number of other handy fixes to make your time in the 10th world slightly easier. Slightly. \nThe two events fixed in this update are \"you are being hunted\" and \"the horde is attacking\", which were previously in the game files but didn't trigger as expected. According to the Valheim wiki, the hunt event is supposed to spawn a bunch of wolves, while the horde event should summon a goblin army of Fulings (including Berserkers and Shamans). \nThe exact conditions for triggering these events are currently unknown, but the pattern established by previous events suggests the hunt event could require killing one wolf and Moder, while the horde raid should occur in-between killing Moder and the final boss. So if you're currently in the late-game, things are about to get a bit spicier. \nRead more",

It was warmly received at launch, but really made its mark - and found a significant audience - once it released on Xbox Game Pass.\nFollowing the game's well-deserved, and continuing, success on Microsoft's subscription service, RageSquid announced it was working on a next-gen enhancements upgrade for Xbox Series X/S - and that update is now finally here.\nRead more",

          "description": "You may have already seen some mutterings about this on social media, but E3's online portal opened up to press this week - and to nobody's surprise, it's a real mess. This year's E3 is all-online thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and the portal is supposed to be some sort of substitute for the physical show, featuring virtual booths for exhibitors, online events, and a variety of articles and bits of content about games.\nThe portal goes a little further than you might expect, however, with old-school internet forums, an avatar system and a gamified rewards system. The latter is what really caught my attention, as not only can you earn points from nosing around the portal, but you can also compete in online leaderboards  to see who is The Biggest E3 Fan. Naturally, this appealed to my competitive side and I set out to land myself a spot at the top of the virtual podium. \"With a limited pool of games media, this will be a cinch,\" I thought. But alas, my attempts to do so were foiled by an unexpected enemy: the E3 portal itself. \nThings started off pretty well. After doing some strange password reset shenanigans to actually get into my account, the E3 website presented me with an avatar creator (if you've ever heard of a picrew, it's basically that). I don't know why the avatar creator exists, but I think it might also be the best part of the E3 website. It's surprisingly lenient with what it will allow you to do - there are colour wheels for your hair and eyes, and you can even move your facial features around. Don't expect the sort of silliness you can get from something like Nintendo's Mii Maker, but the E3 avatar creator isn't afraid to get a little weird:\nRead more",

          "description": "Is your Russian feeling a little rusty? Not to worry, as an English translation for Fallout 2 mod Olympus 2207 has finally been released - so you can put the Russian dictionary down for now. \nOlympus 2207 is a huge total conversion mod for Fallout 2 that was released back in December 2014, and at long last, it now has an official English translation. The developers used Fallout 2's engine and basic mechanics to create a new story that's unconnected to the Fallout series: it adapts features like Fallout 2's skills and perks system, but adds new graphics, additional gameplay mechanics, and - of course - a bunch of new stories and quests. There's even a crafting system, a mini-game for hacking electronic panels, and a flexible structure with no main quest. \"Do you want to become the tyrant of Radius, or do you want to improve the lives of everyone in it?,\" the official mod page explains. \"The choice is yours!\"\nAs explained in the lore section of the mod's website, the game takes place in the year 2207 in the Silicon Valley region of the US. The Great War of 2013 created an irradiated wasteland, and while some managed to escape into improvised shelters (or a luxurious vault called Livos), many had to \"adapt to the new conditions on the evolutionary, genetic level\". Sounds rough. Anyway, some lucky survivors found themselves inside a skyscraper called Olympus when this all went down. The game centres on this skyscraper, which everyone in the wasteland seems desperate to enter: it promises energy with its solar panels and protection from the horrors outside. If you can get past the guards at the bottom, however. \nRead more",

A bunch of dev-made bug compilation videos are now circulating on social media and file-sharing sites, showing some rarely-seen work-in-progress builds and rather spectacular bugs.  \nAs Eurogamer reported on Friday, some dev videos had already started to leak alongside the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 and Thronebreaker, and it appears many of these are now being shared on 4chan, Reddit and YouTube. Most of the videos are being shared using video hosting platform Streamable, but many are now being pulled offline (they are, after all, the result of an illegal ransomware hack). \nSome are short clips showing the player-character being ricocheted into the sky to the sound of Shooting Stars, or being knocked out only to wake up to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim opening. Others are more complex - one compilation shows several bugs with an off-tune recorder version of Spoiler (the track by DJ Hyper used in Cyberpunk's 2018 E3 trailer). Another lengthy edit called \"CyberElBuggado2020\" shows hotdog motorbikes, NPCs T-posing to the sound of Thriller, and Johnny Silverhand saying \"this is going to be a disaster\" in Spanish. \nRead more",

If you've never played the game before, expect geysers of blood, a winningly weird sense of humour, and (rather barren) bike-based open-world interludes in amongst the spirited and largely entertaining action.\nRead more",

          "description": "Earlier this year, CD Projekt confirmed it had been hit by a \"targeted cyber attack\" that saw its internal systems compromised and sensitive information held to ransom. After CD Projekt said it would not comply with the group's demands, the hackers announced that source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent and an unreleased version of The Witcher 3 would be auctioned to the highest bidder, and source code for Gwent was publicly leaked. \nAt the time, the hackers claimed they had received a satisfying offer for the information, and the auction was then closed with a condition of \"no further distribution\" agreed with the buyer. But that stolen data now appears to have resurfaced, with source code, assets and software development kits for platforms including the PlayStation 5 seemingly being shared online. Eurogamer has also seen internal development videos showing work-in-progress builds of Cyberpunk 2077. \nAccording to security blog DataBreaches.net, earlier this week a threat actor group decided to release CD Projekt's information in order to promote its new leaks platform. A note from the hackers was also discovered by security software provider Emsisoft back in March (via IT Pro), and an uncensored version of this was shared on 4chan yesterday (the link provided in the note no longer works, but the data is now being shared elsewhere). The note claims the release of the stolen information is part of a \"charity fundraising\" effort - although as the group is asking for payment in cryptocurrency, there's no way to guarantee that's actually going to a good cause.\nRead more",

A new \"contact system\" is being rolled out as part of Rust's June update, and it will highlight those who have done bad things to you. \n\"Upon meeting a new player they'll be logged into your contacts and the contact system will now keep a history of all interactions (good, bad, indifferent, rage-inducing etc),\" Facepunch explained in a press release. \"To help quickly identify friend from foe, players' nameplates will now display blue for friendly and red for hostile. Waving at players will reveal your name (it doesn't always pay to be nice...) and using binoculars will reveal if a player is unknown, hostile or friendly from large distances.\"\nOn the surface, it sounds similar to the way hostile players are marked in Red Dead Online with a red dot or star depending on their recent actions. With Rust, however, it seems like it will be up to the individual to categorise other players: you can designate someone as an enemy, for instance, and make notes on each player you meet.

          "description": "Over the past few months, Apex Legends players have increasingly reported problems with DDoS attacks in their games: one moment they've been sliding their way around World's Edge, the next, their game has frozen and they've been booted out. It's become a particular issue in Ranked games, where miscreants have used DDoS attacks to artificially boost themselves up the leaderboards. Hoovering up a bunch of disconnected opponents is easier than actually playing the game, after all. \nRespawn has already indicated it's taking the situation seriously - banning some behind high-profile cases, and mentioning that it's even considering legal action against those carrying out the attacks. But it seems progress is being made towards a more permanent solution, with security analyst Conor \"Hideouts\" Ford explaining on Twitter that significant progress has been made on a fix. \n\"The DDoS situation is being addressed as we speak by our very own @ricklesauceur [lead software engineer Samy Duc],\" Ford said. \"It isn't the easiest fix in the world but huge steps are being made to take care of this.\"\nRead more",

Those who have an Epic Games Store account can grab Among Us for free until 3rd June.\nOnce you've claimed the free game, you'll have access to new map The Airship, and be able to play with friends on other platforms like Switch, Android and iOS. The game is due to arrive on PlayStation later this year, too, so hopefully there won't be any problems with cross-play there. \nRead more",

These, Guerrilla later confirms, are the remnants of San Francisco, millennia into the future, and it's here that Aloy encounters machine-riding raiders, immediately embarking on some nimble combat, firing arrows and hurtling acrobatically around the environment to escape their attack.\nThis initial sequence ends beneath the waves as Aloy swims through gorgeous coral reefs, kelp, and exotic fauna, fighting the current as she goes.

Not much was shown beyond a brief trailer revealing a logo - though that logo did reveal a turn towards dark fantasy, and what series' creator dubbed a Dragon Quest 'for adults'.

It's a long one too, with Microsoft promising 90-minutes of announcements - hopefully that's a taut 90 minutes with none of the waffly filler it usually loves to pad out its livestreams with (hello Inside Xbox, I'm looking at you).\nAs you'd expect, there's little in the way of specific regarding the games we'll be seeing - all the better to retain that all-important element of surprise - and Microsoft is merely teasing a look at the \"epic gaming lineup coming out of [the Bethesda] partnership, the incredible games coming to Xbox this holiday, upcoming releases on Xbox Game Pass, and more.\"\nRead more",

Since then, it's been unclear if Blizzard was still planning to press ahead with a proper large-scale physical gathering in 2021, perhaps around the early November weekend usually reserved for its BlizzCon shows.\nIn a new post on the BlizzCon website, however, show executive producer Saralyn Smith has now confirmed the 2021 event will not be going ahead.\nRead more",

Some of her flights are lasting a little longer than Respawn would like, it seems, and the developer has decided to clip her wings. \nAs explained by associate live balance designer John Larson, players figured out that hovering with Valkyrie's jetpack currently costs very little fuel - and were using this to \"take coffee breaks above the final fight in scrims\". It reminds me a bit of when Fortnite players used planes to stay out of battles until the very last moment. \nIn any case, the 10 percent fuel cost for hovering is now being removed entirely, and from Thursday onwards it will cost you the full 100 percent to hang around in the air. When asked why it was being removed rather than nerfed, Larson said that Respawn experimented with a 50-75 percent fuel cost, but found that this \"didn't feel meaningfully different and still allowed Valk to stay airborne for too long in certain final rings. \nRead more",

          "description": "Wondering what Sonic's been up to lately? Well, it looks like Sega's poised to reveal all in a 30th anniversary livestream for the prickly blue icon, scheduled to take place this Thursday.\nSonic Central, as Sega's calling its digital showcase, gets underway at 5pm BST/9am PT this Thursday, 27th May, and promises a first look at a number of upcoming \"projects, partnerships, and events\" the company has been working on as part of its anniversary celebrations.\nThere's no hint as to what those might be as yet, but recent rumours have suggested Sega is prepping both a new collection of classic Sonic titles and a remaster of the hedgehog's 2010 outing Sonic Colors. Perhaps we'll also finally get a glimpse of Sonic's next major new game, which was confirmed to be in production back in 2019.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's a busy day for developer Ion Lands; not only is its gorgeous Blade Runner-esque delivery thriller Cloudpunk's \"sequel-sized\" paid DLC, City of Ghosts, now available on PC, the studio has announced a new cyberpunk-themed life-sim spin-off too.\nCity of Angels, which seems as good a place as any to start, offers a brand-new, fully voiced story campaign that serves as a direct sequel to the original game. Main protagonist Rania and canine companion Camus return for another skyhigh HOVA-based jaunt around the neon-drenched metropolis of Nivalis, but this time there's a new hero - deadbeat gambler Hayse - with players switching between two interlinking stories as the adventure unfolds.\nIon Worlds says City of Angels is longer than the original story, as well as \"darker, tenser, more complex\", and promises new areas to explore, new characters and mysteries, HOVA customisation, street racing, and different endings depending on player choices. It's out now on Steam for £12.99/$14.99 USD, and there's a 10% launch day discount.\nRead more",

It's hard to forget, to be honest, but if you haven't yet bought it on iOS, Android or the PlayStation Store then your time is limited, as the game is being delisted from these platforms at the end of May. \nManga artist and Hatoful Boyfriend creator Hato Moa announced the news on her Twitter account earlier this week, explaining that both Hatoful Boyfriend and its seasonal sequel Holiday Star will no longer be purchasable on these platforms as \"publishing agreements on those platforms are coming to an end\". Those who already bought the games through these platforms will still be able to use them, however, while the games will remain on sale via Steam. \nIf you missed it the first time around, well, Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel about dating birds that was released back in 2014. I guess you can say it's been out for aviary long time. You play as the only human student accepted into a school for birds, where you must navigate classes and build relationships with talking birds. It's all pretty eccentric, but the game earned itself a cult following and critical acclaim for the quality of its character writing.  \nRead more",

Respawn explained that this is similar to the penalty for Ranked Battle Royale games, and will apply to those who leave a full squad in the middle of a match. \nUnfortunately it seems a couple of people are currently getting unfairly punished by the new penalty, with some reporting being slapped with 10-minute sin bins for leaving during the end screen animations.

          "description": "After an agonisingly long hiatus Sega's much-loved fighting series Virtua Fighter is back, with a remaster of the most recent game coming to PlayStation 4 next month. \nVirtua Fighter: Ultimate Showdown looks to be a remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, the last installment which hit arcades way back in 2010. Final Showdown was itself the last iteration of Virtua Fighter 5, folding in new characters Taka-Arashi and Jean Kujo as well as introducing a more athletic moveset for its cast. We wrote some nice things about it in our Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown review upon its console launch in 2012. \nVirtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown saw the series bow out at its peak, although it's been kept alive in some way via appearances in the arcades of Sega's hugely successful Yakuza games. Is this the mark of a grand return for Virtua Fighter? The trailer - exclusively hosted on IGN - suggests perhaps not, declaring that the ultimate 3D fighter is back for the final round, with this remaster coinciding with Sega's ongoing 60th anniversary celebrations. Still, there remains hope and it's a delight to see the series back in any form. \nRead more",
