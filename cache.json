These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other&#8217;s existence with almost no interference...</p></blockquote>",

Taking a broad understanding of hacking as an &#8220;activity allowed by the system that subverts the&#8230; system,&#8221; Schneier draws on his background analyzing weaknesses in cybersecurity to examine how those with power take advantage of financial, legal, political, and cognitive systems. He decries how venture capitalists “hack” market dynamics by subverting the pressures of supply and demand, noting that venture capital has kept Uber afloat despite the company having not yet turned a profit. Legal loopholes constitute another form of hacking, Schneier suggests, discussing how the inability of tribal courts to try non-Native individuals means that many sexual assaults of Native American women go unprosecuted because they were committed by non-Native American men. Schneier outlines strategies used by corporations to capitalize on neural processes and &#8220;hack&#8230; our attention circuits,&#8221; pointing out how Facebook&#8217;s algorithms boost content that outrages users because doing so increases engagement. Elegantly probing the mechanics of exploitation, Schneier makes a persuasive case that &#8220;we need society&#8217;s rules and laws to be as patchable as your computer.&#8221; With lessons that extend far beyond the tech world, this has much to offer...</p></blockquote>",

In order to counter a hack, it becomes necessary to think like a hacker. Schneier lays out the ramifications of a variety of hacks, contrasting the hacking of the tax code to benefit the wealthy with hacks in realms such as sports that can innovate and change a game for the better. The key to dealing with hacks is being proactive and providing adequate patches to fix any vulnerabilities. Schneier’s fascinating work illustrates how susceptible many systems are to being hacked and how lives can be altered by these subversions.

          "description": "<p>With the release of ChatGPT, I&#8217;ve read many random articles about this or that threat from the technology.  This <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07321.pdf\">paper</a> is a good survey of the field: what the threats are, how we might detect machine-generated text, directions for future research. It&#8217;s a solid grounding amongst all of the hype.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Machine Generated Text: A Comprehensive Survey of Threat Models and Detection Methods</p>\n<p><b>Abstract:</b> Advances in natural language generation (NLG) have resulted in machine generated text that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human authored text. Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and  accountability...</p></blockquote>",

Following security best practices when developing and configuring microservices do not result in non-vulnerable microservices.

It explains how analyzing the behavior of clients and services from a security standpoint, named here \"Security-Behavior Analysis\", can protect the deployed vulnerable microservices.

Operating income was 41bn yen (£258m), down nearly 18 percent  on the same time period year-on-year.\r\n\n\r\nOver the nine months ending 31st December 2022, Square Enix launched a large number of games but lacked a major Final Fantasy release.

          "description": "AMD's Ryzen 7000X3D gaming-focused processors finally have a release date - or rather, two release dates. The Ryzen 9 7900X3D and 7950X3D will debut on February 28th, with the 7800X3D arriving on April 6th. \nAMD announced prices for its new CPUs too, with the eight-core 7800X3D at $449, the 12-core 7900X3D at $599 and the 16-core 7950X3D at $699. For context, the original eight, 12 and 16-core Ryzen 7000 models have MSRPs of $399, $549 and $699, respectively, so this is at most a $50 premium in terms of MSRP - although of course retail prices have dropped significantly since the original Ryzen 7000 models debuted in September last year. \nAll three X3D CPUs have been hotly anticipated since they were announced just after the new year, as they combine the new features of AMD's Ryzen 7000 series - an efficient 5nm process, more powerful socket and generally excellent performance - with the 3D V-Cache design that made the rather ordinary 5800X into the ridiculously powerful Ryzen 5800X3D. By tripling the chip's L3 cache, the 5800X3D was able to compete with Ryzen 7000 and Intel's 12th and 13th-gen designs in many games - despite being bound to older DDR4 memory and the venerable AM4 socket. That makes an X3D version of Ryzen 7000 quite a tantalising prospect for extreme gaming performance. \n Read more",

While it does expand on the series' story in its own way, there are elements from the game that those who have played will likely miss, and I'm confident there will be plenty of discourse on this episode. \n\r\nSo, without further ado, let's dive on in and take a closer look at the third episode of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, 'Long, long time'. \r\n \nRead more",

Episode 2, meanwhile, secured the largest week-two audience growth for an Original drama series in HBO's history. \r\n\n\r\nAnd now, just under three weeks into The Last of Us' first season, HBO has confirmed there's more on the way. \"I'm so grateful to [The Last of Us co-creator] Neil Druckmann and HBO for our partnership,\" showrunner and series writer Craig Mazin said of the news, \"and I'm even more grateful to the millions of people who have joined us on this journey\".\r\n \nRead more",

Just as a general point of interest, the most recent entries in the Far Cry series used the Dunia engine. \r\n \nRead more",

Yeah, I didn't buy that either). \r\n\n\r\nHowever, somehow, the couple at the start of Fallout 4 manage to survive the game's opening nuclear blast, and remain unscathed by the heat flash that would have hit them (not to mention, those looking right at the blast would likely be blinded at the very least). \r\n\n\r\nSo, while Fallout 4's introduction is certainly an impactful one, it is not exactly known for its realism. Well, that is, until now. Thanks to modders, we can now start a new game of Fallout 4... and not survive the introduction.\r\n \nRead more",

We liked it a lot at Eurogamer, awarding it a Recommended badge.\r\n\n\r\nIts newly announced prequel, officially titled Road 96: Mile 0, rewinds the clock just a little bit further to tell a tale set just prior to the events of the first game.

Since then, though, its journey to release has been less than smooth. Its initial June 2022 release date was delayed by a year when Fntastic suddenly announced it was switching development to Unreal Engine 5 less than a month before its planned arrival, then earlier this week, with just two months to go before its revised launch date, the developer pulled the game's Steam listing and announced another delay - pushing its release back a further nine months, this time blaming a trademark dispute.\r\n\n\r\nThroughout all this, very little has actually been seen of The Day Before beyond its initial announcement trailer, a 13-minute gameplay video revealed several months later, and 59-seconds of additional gameplay at the start of this year. All of which has lead to a rise in suggestions around the internet the game may not even be in development at all.\r\n \nRead more",

At the time, developer Full Circle attempted to assuage fan fears by insisting the game's monetisation would be \"mostly about cosmetics and convenience\", promising no pay to win mechanics or paid gameplay advantages, no paid gameplay elements or areas of the map, and no paid loot boxes.\r\n\n\r\nGiven those assurances, players were a little perturbed when, not long after Skate's free-to-play announcement, dataminers uncovered evidence of loot-box-like Swag Bags - purchasable with \"Taps\" and containing randomised apparel - in a version of Skate's playtest source code.\r\n \nRead more",

That number, obviously, does not factor in audience figures outside the US.\r\n\n\r\nHBO has previously said Sunday night viewership for one of its shows typically represents 20-40% of an episode's gross audience, meaning its latest Episode 2 figures are likely to grow substantially. Episode 1, for instance, has now nearly quadrupled its initial audience, securing over 18m views in the space of a week.\r\n \nRead more",

The internationally unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus lies to the north, while in the south sits the island's larger Greek Cypriot-dominated region. Between the two sits the Buffer Zone - an area which on paper sounds like a hazard, but in reality is home to 10,000 people - where Pokémon cannot spawn naturally. \r\n \nRead more",

It's a fascinating exploration of one of the key features of any competitive multiplayer game, and Apex Legends players have certainly enjoyed the transparency.\r\n\n\r\nAs a Call of Duty player, I couldn't help but look at Respawn's blog post and wish Activision would do something similar.\r\n\n\r\nCall of Duty SBMM has been a topic of discussion for years, and with each new release in the series, the same vociferous back-and-forth emerges. I've reported on COD SBMM numerous times, usually when players get so disgruntled with it that they start to play the game in silly ways, such as deliberately losing in a bid to matchmake against lower-skilled players in subsequent lobbies. Activision has always taken a dim view of third-party websites and apps that let players try to game the system, too.\r\n \nRead more",

It's weirdly, wonderfully satisfying stuff, and surprisingly relaxing too.\r\n\n\r\nPowerWash Simulator's incoming crossover, officially titled the Tomb Raider Special Pack, gives players access to five new levels in as part of a new mini-campaign, including a sprawling version of Croft Manor so utterly filthy, it's hard not to wonder what Lara's been up to.\n Read more",

It's also introducing what it calls \"cross-stamp migration\" to make it easier for players to be paired. Some additional information on the changes can be found in a dev blog from December.\r\n \nRead more",

Functionally, outposts serve as places players can trade, cash in contracts, pay off factions, and meet other players - but, as detailed in Ubisoft's latest gameplay devstream, they're also locations where they might find narrative content Ubisoft is calling \"investigations\". \r\n \nRead more",

There are huge games on the horizon and plenty to look forward to - and look forward we will. \r\n\n2023 promises to be a stellar year for video games, full of proper current-gen console exclusives, awesome indies and more than a few titles held up from last year (and the year before). The next 12 months should see all of these and more splurge out onto the scene for you to try. But where to start? \nJoining me to pick out our highlights for the year are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan - and there's some surprising picks in there, as well as Pikmin 4! Apparently some new Final Fantasy game is coming out too, and Zelda's up to something. Beyond video games themselves, there's also The Last of Us TV show to look forward to - that's out next week! - and hopefully some recommendations from us for some lesser-known gems also waiting in the wings.

But, aside from my arrival in the world, it was also a great year because it was the year that the Legend of Zelda cartoon aired. \r\n\n\r\nNow, I know what you are thinking: \"Victoria, why would you care about this? You would have been a newborn when this cartoon was playing on TV and therefore have no idea what was happening. You were probably just learning what your hand was or experiencing mashed potatoes for the first time.\"\r\n\n\r\nThis is very true. I was. But I'm also a huge Legend of Zelda fan, and that means as soon as I was aware of the existence of the Zelda cartoon, I tracked it down and watched it for myself. And then, when I had children of my own, I watched it again with them on YouTube.

It stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, with other notable cast members including Nick Offerman in the role of Bill, Jeffrey Pierce (who played Joel's brother Tommy in the Last of Us video games) as quarantine zone rebel Perry, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge, who reprises her video game role of Marlene, the leader of the Fireflies resistance.\r\n\n\r\nThe last few months have seen HBO's PR machine crank into top gear as The Last of Us' January release approaches, with December bringing the show's second full-length trailer. Now, though, some lucky professional critics have had the chance to watch the entirety of the show's first season, and - despite some notable changes to the source material - the praise is effusive.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We're mere weeks away from the release of EA Motive's extremely promising remake of sci-fi horror classic Dead Space, and to sweeten the deal for those considering a pre-order, EA is bundling in a copy of the original Dead Space 2 on Steam.\r\n\n\r\nEA Motive's Dead Space remake - which launches for PC and current-gen consoles on 27th January - is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games' much-loved 2008 original, reimagining engineer Isaac Clarke's terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura with enhanced audio and visuals, gameplay refinements, and more.\r\n\n\r\nAs spotted by VG247, players that pre-order the remake on Steam will now get a nifty bonus in the form of 2011's Dead Space 2, meaning they can dive straight into the Isaac's continuing story when the credits roll. Despite its age, Dead Space 2 ordinarily costs £17.99 on Steam, so that's a decent saving for anyone who's yet to experience the well-regarded sequel.\r\n \nRead more",
