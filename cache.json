Developers use logging frameworks to keep track of what happens in a given application. To exploit Log4Shell, an attacker only needs to get the system to log a strategically crafted string of code. From there they can load arbitrary code on the targeted server and install malware or launch other attacks. Notably, hackers can introduce the snippet in seemingly benign ways, like by sending the string in an email or setting it as an account username...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "There's a lot going on in the world of Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock today; not only has the studio announced it's been acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, it's also just released the first big post-launch content update for its well-received co-op zombie shooter. The latter brings with it a range of tweaks and additions, the most notable of which is a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression.\nFirst the acquisition news; as of today, following Tencent's purchase of Turtle Rock's parent company Slamfire, the studio is now wholly owned by the Chinese conglomerate. According to the announcement, Turtle Rock will continue to operate independently at its Lake Forest, California, offices, with co-founders Phil Robb and Chris Ashton remaining at the helm.\nRead more",

And now here's another massive figure for the record books: it's officially the first game to surpass one trillion views on YouTube.\nTo celebrate the immense milestone, YouTube has launched a new website highlighting the creators and videos that helped Minecraft reach 1,000,000,000,000 views over the last decade - a figure that would, as YouTube points out to put it into some kind of perspective, amount to over 30,000 years if each view equated to just one second of time.\nRead more",

It'll be published by Koch Media's Prime Matter division and there are a selection of new screenshots to tide people over until more solid release date news comes their way.\nIt has, of course, been a long and eventful road for the System Shock remake, which was originally intended to be a remaster of Looking Glass Technologies' cult-classic 1994 sci-fi horror before ballooning in scope. By the time its Kickstarter commenced in July 2016, Nightdive was calling it a \"reboot\" and, after a rocky period of development, the studio announced it was putting the project on hiatus after letting \"things get out of control\".\nRead more",
