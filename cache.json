From the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</p></blockquote>",

Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "<p>The <i>Washington Post</i> is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/09/15/government-surveillance-database-dhs/\">reporting</a> that the US Customs and Border Protection agency is seizing and copying cell phone, tablet, and computer data from &#8220;as many as&#8221; 10,000 phones per year, including an unspecified number of American citizens. This is done without a warrant, because &#8220;&#8230;courts have long granted an exception to border authorities, allowing them to search people&#8217;s devices without a warrant or suspicion of a crime.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>CBP&#8217;s inspection of people&#8217;s phones, laptops, tablets and other electronic devices as they enter the country has long been a controversial practice that the agency has defended as a low-impact way to pursue possible security threats and determine an individual&#8217;s &#8220;intentions upon entry&#8221; into the U.S. But the revelation that thousands of agents have access to a searchable database without public oversight is a new development in what privacy advocates and some lawmakers warn could be an infringement of Americans&#8217; Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures...</p></blockquote>",

The lifetime of local ephemeral storage does not extend beyond the life of the individual pod. It is exposed to pods using the container’s writable layer, logs directory, and EmptyDir volumes. Before this feature was introduced, there were issues related to the lack of local storage accounting and isolation, such as Pods not knowing how much local storage is available and being unable to request guaranteed local storage.

So, we're pressing the 'unlaunch' button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th,\" says Nvidia, in a remarkable new blog post that effectively calls a halt to the upcoming launch of its most contentious of RTX 4000 releases.\nUnveiled by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on September 20th, the RTX 4000 line of graphics hardware is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, fabricated on TSMC's 4nm process. The flagship GPU - the GeForce RTX 4090 - released a couple of days ago and was lauded for its massive generational leap over the existing RTX 3000 flagships, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. However, it's fair to say that the same level of acclaim and anticipation was not bestowed upon the RTX 4080, announced in two very different flavours.\nThe table below reveals that the spec differential wasn't just about the amount of onboard VRAM: each RTX 4080 model was based on an entirely different core processor, with wild variations in the amount of CUDA codes (compute power) and memory bandwidth. In effect, two very different graphics cards were being sold under the same name at very different price-points.\n Read more",

Some of remake's environmental changes have been made to enhance the atmosphere, while other were required to accommodate the fact the Ishimura is now one seamless, interconnected ship, with players no longer needed to rely on the tram to get around.\r\n \nRead more",

The event's first half, running from October 20th to 27th, features the arrival of Mega Banette in Mega Raids for the first time, plus the Shiny versions of Noibat and Galarian Yamask. But it also offers some more surprising additions. \r\n\n\r\n These include the decision by developer Niantic to sell not one but two cheap event tickets featuring time-limited quests and rewards, with both a $1 and $5 option available. From the sounds of things, these will each offer different rewards, with the former offering encounters with Yamask, while the pricier option gets you an admittedly very cool animated Halloween lantern avatar item/pose.\r\n\n\r\nNiantic is obviously trying something new here with a pair of different ticket options for the same overall event, as well as the fact these rewards will be time-limited - even if you paid. Typically, event questlines from Special Research remain in-game permanently, allowing you to complete them at your leisure. \r\n \nRead more",

Microsoft stated it was far from the leader in terms of console share and PC games sold, and lacked any real presence on mobile devices. In a particularly eye-opening claim, Microsoft even said PlayStation's userbase would be \"significantly larger\" than Xbox even if every COD player ditched Sony. At the same time, Microsoft also criticised the regulator for appearing to take Sony's own complaints about the deal at face value. \r\n\nIs this fighting talk from Microsoft, or squeaky bum time in Redmond over real concerns the UK will block the deal outright? Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan share their thoughts on whether the deal will go through, what changes  Microsoft could make to get it over the finish line, and whether it should go ahead. \r\n \nRead more",

The duo can regularily be seen getting into all sorts of exploits that often result in them losing girls, getting wedgies and a myriad of other such fiascos. Remember that time Bart sold his soul to Milhouse? That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. \nHowever, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as \"The Springfield Files.\"\n\r\nThis episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer's conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out. But that is not what we are here to talk about. Rather, I want to remind you all of the arcade game Milhouse plays in this episode - Kevin Costner's Waterworld. \r\n \nRead more",

This, he said, was a little tricky to answer insofar as different people will likely have different definitions of \"hard sci-fi\", but for Bethesda, \"It is more hard to us, where you can draw that line from, okay, here's how man explored space, and [then] look at our ships and say, alright that has some visual identity back to that\".\r\n\n\r\nHowever, he also called the question a bit of a trap, \"because it's a video game.

Interestingly, this third outing was initially planned to be free-to-play title before Perfect World eventually capitulated after a bit of an outcry - but now, following Torchlight 3's less-than-stellar reception, those free-to-play plans are back for Torchlight: Infinite.\r\n \nRead more",

Is it perhaps formed from the whisper of a backward-speaking entity in a red-curtain-clad room? Does it droop provocatively across surfaces like a slowly melting pocket watch? Does it wear a snazzy top hat and rain in multitudes?\r\n\n\r\nAlas, none of those things; the Lunar Shift's big gimmick is that - in a similar colour-changing fashion to last year's Aqua Shift controller - it shifts from silver to gold as it catches the light. This, says, Microsoft, gives it a \"stylised, smokey atmosphere\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Square Enix Montréal - the developer behind the likes of Hitman Go and Lara Croft Go - has rebranded as Studio Onoma following its acquisition by Embracer Group in May.\r\n\n\r\nSquare Enix Montréal was one of three studios purchased by Embracer Group as part of a $300m USD deal with Square Enix earlier this year. Following the deal's completion in August, Embracer now also owns Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal, alongside major IPs including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and Legacy of Kain.\r\n\n\r\nWhile Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal will keep their existing identities following the Embracer acquisition, Square Enix Montréal has now shaken off the last remnants of its former owner with a new name and new logo, both of which have been detailed in a lengthy post on the developer's website. The key takeway for the curious, though, is that \"Onoma is Greek for name and names offer endless possibilities\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Phil Spencer's shelf is at it again. Ever since it was discovered the Xbox boss had secreted an Xbox Series S in plain sight behind him during a video interview months before the console was announced, fans have been scouring his furnishings for teases of more future reveals - and speculation is now mounting that Spencer has just revealed Microsoft's long-in-the-works Xbox Game Pass streaming device on Twitter.\r\n\n\r\nSpencer shared his latest shelf photo earlier today, writing, \"Vault Boy left the shelter and stopped by my office to celebrate the Fallout 25th Anniversary.\" Conspicuously, though, the Vault Boy statue that's supposedly the focus of the tweet is far from the focus of the image. Instead, the photo continues several shelves upward, revealing a mysterious Xbox-branded box fans have so far struggled to identify - and which many are speculating might be the Xbox game-streaming box, codenamed Keystone, announced in 2021.\r\n\n\r\nAs described by Microsoft in an update on the project in May, the as-yet-unseen Keystone is intended to be a low-cost device enabling users to play Xbox Cloud Gaming titles through any TV or monitor without the need for a console. Reports on its exact nature have varied - some claimed it was a stick-like dongle, others a box - but whatever it was previously, Microsoft said it was 'pivoting away' from the then-current iteration to refocus on \"a new approach\".\r\n \nRead more",

And in the 2D original, it was really well done pixel art, so we realised that we couldn't have a Tactics Ogre game without this really high-quality, awesome looking 2D pixel art.

          "description": "Seven new patent filings from Destiny developer Bungie have been unearthed, predominantly all linked to virtual controls on touch-enabled devices, lending further credence to reports earlier this year that it had a Destiny mobile game in the works.\r\n\n\r\nThose reports first surfaced back in July, when The Game Post, citing a source with knowledge of Chinese mobile developer NetEase's plans, claimed the company was collaborating with Bungie to bring a completely new instalment in the Destiny series to mobile - a project said to have already been in development for several years.\r\n\n\r\nIt's in this context that the seven newly unearthed Bungie patents (as spotted by The Game Post) prove particularly interesting. Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an 'isometric/top-down' perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Google's Arts and Culture team has created a cute Zelda-like adventure for those looking to further their education on ancient Mesoamerica.\r\n\n\r\nKnown as The Descent on the Serpent, this game was made in collaboration with Mexico's National Museum of Anthropology (thanks, The Verge). It starts off with the player visiting a museum. However, out of nowhere, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, Tezcatlipoca, rushes in and steals an artefact on display. \r\n\n\r\nThis clearly can't be good news, and soon a talking statue, which is also on display at the museum, asks for your help returning the artefact  before the equinox happens. Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do \"love exploring\". The talking statue then swiftly transports you back in time to ancient Mesoamerica where you need to find 20 icons to return to the city of Chichen Itza. \r\n \nRead more",

The hack has robbed Rockstar of its oppurtunity to show the game on its own terms - and for what benefit? We discuss.\r\n\nAfter that, we turn our attention to the YouTuber who accidentally outed themselves as being behind an \"insider\" Twitter account after posting under-wraps information they had been given by Ubisoft.

It's easily one of the biggest gen-on-gen increases in performance we've seen, even based on limited testing. 4K gaming for higher refresh rate monitors and TVs is not a problem on most modern titles - and by extension, 8K at 60fps is now viable if you're one of the crazy few (like me) that actually has an 8K TV. Combine that increase in performance with the new DLSS 3 - with its AI-based frame generation - and suddenly the most intense workloads in PC gaming play out with unerring fluidity.\nWe were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already sunk a full weekend into it, we're not done yet and need some extra time - so with that being the case, we've put together a teaser video showing some of the work we've already done.\n Read more",
