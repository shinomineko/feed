In order to counter a hack, it becomes necessary to think like a hacker. Schneier lays out the ramifications of a variety of hacks, contrasting the hacking of the tax code to benefit the wealthy with hacks in realms such as sports that can innovate and change a game for the better. The key to dealing with hacks is being proactive and providing adequate patches to fix any vulnerabilities. Schneier’s fascinating work illustrates how susceptible many systems are to being hacked and how lives can be altered by these subversions. Schneier’s deep dive into this cross-section of technology and humanity makes for investigative gold...</p></blockquote>",

Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and  accountability...</p></blockquote>",

Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations.

This article delves into the use cases around resource management by leveraging the PriorityClass object to protect mission-critical or high-priority pods from getting evicted and making sure that the application pods are up, running, and serving traffic.\nResource management in Kubernetes\nThe control plane consists of multiple components, out of which the scheduler (usually the built-in kube-scheduler) is one of the comp…",

Functionally, outposts serve as places players can trade, cash in contracts, pay off factions, and meet other players - but, as detailed in Ubisoft's latest gameplay devstream, they're also locations where they might find narrative content Ubisoft is calling \"investigations\". \r\n \nRead more",

There are huge games on the horizon and plenty to look forward to - and look forward we will. \r\n\n2023 promises to be a stellar year for video games, full of proper current-gen console exclusives, awesome indies and more than a few titles held up from last year (and the year before). The next 12 months should see all of these and more splurge out onto the scene for you to try. But where to start? \nJoining me to pick out our highlights for the year are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan - and there's some surprising picks in there, as well as Pikmin 4! Apparently some new Final Fantasy game is coming out too, and Zelda's up to something. Beyond video games themselves, there's also The Last of Us TV show to look forward to - that's out next week! - and hopefully some recommendations from us for some lesser-known gems also waiting in the wings.

But, aside from my arrival in the world, it was also a great year because it was the year that the Legend of Zelda cartoon aired. \r\n\n\r\nNow, I know what you are thinking: \"Victoria, why would you care about this? You would have been a newborn when this cartoon was playing on TV and therefore have no idea what was happening. You were probably just learning what your hand was or experiencing mashed potatoes for the first time.\"\r\n\n\r\nThis is very true. I was. But I'm also a huge Legend of Zelda fan, and that means as soon as I was aware of the existence of the Zelda cartoon, I tracked it down and watched it for myself. And then, when I had children of my own, I watched it again with them on YouTube.

It stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, with other notable cast members including Nick Offerman in the role of Bill, Jeffrey Pierce (who played Joel's brother Tommy in the Last of Us video games) as quarantine zone rebel Perry, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge, who reprises her video game role of Marlene, the leader of the Fireflies resistance.\r\n\n\r\nThe last few months have seen HBO's PR machine crank into top gear as The Last of Us' January release approaches, with December bringing the show's second full-length trailer. Now, though, some lucky professional critics have had the chance to watch the entirety of the show's first season, and - despite some notable changes to the source material - the praise is effusive.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We're mere weeks away from the release of EA Motive's extremely promising remake of sci-fi horror classic Dead Space, and to sweeten the deal for those considering a pre-order, EA is bundling in a copy of the original Dead Space 2 on Steam.\r\n\n\r\nEA Motive's Dead Space remake - which launches for PC and current-gen consoles on 27th January - is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games' much-loved 2008 original, reimagining engineer Isaac Clarke's terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura with enhanced audio and visuals, gameplay refinements, and more.\r\n\n\r\nAs spotted by VG247, players that pre-order the remake on Steam will now get a nifty bonus in the form of 2011's Dead Space 2, meaning they can dive straight into the Isaac's continuing story when the credits roll. Despite its age, Dead Space 2 ordinarily costs £17.99 on Steam, so that's a decent saving for anyone who's yet to experience the well-regarded sequel.\r\n \nRead more",

And with the move comes an inevitable - some would say long overdue - FIFA rating downgrade.\r\n\n\r\n37-year-old Ronaldo, who for years had been one of the two best cards in the FIFA games alongside World Cup winner Lionel Messi, had already dropped three positions for the FIFA 23 top 10 with a 90-rated card. Now, after Ronaldo's poor performance at the World Cup and his move to the Saudi Pro League, EA has knocked Ronaldo down a further peg to his lowest rating since 2007, when the forward broke through at Manchester United.\r\n\n\r\nRonaldo's overall rating is now 88, two lower than the 90 he started FIFA 23 with back in September. Crucially, his specific stats are also lower. His dribbling, for example, is down to 81 from 84, his stamina down to 70 from 74.\r\n \nRead more",

That's the narrative, anyway - but how many cards will actually be available at the MSRP/RRP? \nIt's an important question, because as the old saying goes, there are no bad products, just bad prices. The RTX 4070 Ti is quite a strong option at $799, given its level of performance - particularly for those upgrading from Pascal (GTX 10-series) and Turing (20-series) GPUs or AMD's equivalents. At $899 or $999 though, this graphics card starts to make much less sense. \nAnd with no Founders Edition cards available, we're relying on third-party GPU makers to create SKUs that meet that price point - when it would be much more profitable for them to offer overclocked designs with oversized coolers and RGB bling for $50, $100 or $200 more. In fact, it's these sorts of cards that seem to have been sent out for review, including our unit which offered a paltry 30MHz overclock over stock - but came with a higher price tag to match. \n Read more",

          "description": "AMD has announced a raft of new Ryzen processors at its CES 2023 showcase, including the long-awaited Ryzen 7000X3D processors that should provide a stern rejoinder to Intel's 13th-gen desktop CPUs and could let Team Red reclaim the gaming performance crown. \nThe idea here is pretty simple: take the '3D V-Cache' technology that made AMD's last-gen Ryzen 7 5800X3D so fast that it challenged even next-gen flagship CPUs, and pair it with some of AMD's fastest Ryzen 7000 processors. The result is three new chips, the Ryzen 7800X3D, Ryzen 7900X3D and the Ryzen 7950X3D. All three come with dramatically increased cache sizes - 104MB of L2 and L3 cache on the Ryzen 7 and up to 144MB on the Ryzen 9 - which minimise the time CPUs spend waiting for data to be copied into the cache, increasing performance considerably in some games. \nIn AMD-provided benchmarks, the 7800X3D was between 10 and 25 percent faster than the 5800X3D at 1080p in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Borderlands 3 and F1 22 - slightly less than I would have expected, given that the 7800X3D is also using DDR5 RAM versus the DDR4 on the 5800X3D. Perhaps a more interesting comparison is that of the 7950X3D against the 13900K, where AMD showed between a nine and 24 percent performance lead in Watchdogs Legion, Dota 2, Rainbow Six Siege and Horizon Zero Dawn. \n Read more",

Racing games are a natural fit for virtual reality - it's been my preferred way to play ever since it became a viable option - and Gran Turismo 7 follows in the footsteps of Gran Turismo Sport which was supported by the original PSVR headset.\n\n\r\nPlayStation VR2 is coming out on February 22nd, with units costing a cool £530. Here's everything you need to know about PSVR2, including its launch titles and full specs - and it's a device that Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton has been very enthusiastic about since trying it for himself. \n \nRead more",

Here's what you need to know.\nFirst, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti. This is the renamed, repriced and now relaunched version of the RTX 4080 12GB that was so roundly derided upon its announcement that Nvidia 'unlaunched' the card soon thereafter. The key to that move was a feeling of confusion from gamers and press alike that the card was too distant in price and performance from the 4080 16GB, as it wasn't even based on the same AD103 chip. \nNow, the GPU seems more sensibly positioned - as a small improvement over the popular last-gen RTX 3080, with a price to match of $799. With DLSS 3 frame generation, it can be up to three times faster than the RTX 3090 Ti while consuming nearly half the power, although we look forward to putting those claims to the test. The latest Ada Lovelace card is scheduled to launch on January 5th, so we don't have too long to wait!  \n Read more",

An intriguing mash-up of horse racing and solitaire, it's gone on to earn cult status (though I recall Eurogamer's former in-house solitaire expert Oli Welsh being charmed but not wowed by this take on the form). \r\n\n\r\nPocket Card Jockey: Ride On! - spotted by our friends at VGC - is a buffed-up re-release for Apple Arcade,  with new 3D visuals for racing sections, and it's due out 20th January. It's got me wondering what other 3DS gems are ripe for being rescued by new ports - is it too much to hope for a re-release of Attack of the Friday Monsters? \r\n\r\n \nRead more",
