You grep through one component's logs just to discover that the source of your problem is in another component.  You search there only to discover that you need to enable debug logs to figure out what really went wrong... And it goes on. The more complex the path your request takes, the harder it is to answer questions about where it went.  I've personally spent many hours doing this dance with a variety of Kubernetes components. Distributed tracing is a tool which is designed to help in these situations, and the Kubernetes API Server is, perhaps, the most important Kubernetes component to be able to debug.

          "description": "Authors:\nBen Swartzlander (NetApp)\nKubernetes v1.22, released earlier this month, introduced a redesigned approach for volume\npopulators. Originally implemented\nin v1.18, the API suffered from backwards compatibility issues. Kubernetes v1.22 includes a new API\nfield called dataSourceRef that fixes these problems.\nData sources\nEarlier Kubernetes releases already added a dataSource field into the\nPersistentVolumeClaim API,\nused for cloning volumes and creating volumes from snapshots. You could use the dataSource field when\ncreating a new PVC, referencing either an existing PVC or a VolumeSnapshot in the same namespace.\nThat also modified the normal provisioning process so that instead of yielding an empty volume, the\nnew PVC contained the same data as either the cloned PVC or the cloned Volu…",

For some of the StatefulSet workloads, it may not be the case. For example, a workload like Prometheus with multiple instances of Alertmanager, it should be considered Available only when Alertmanager's state transfer is complete, not when the Pod is in Ready state. Since minReadySeconds adds buffer, the state transfer may be complete before the Pod becomes Available. While this is not a fool proof way of…",

Over in Japan, Nintendo also confirmed Mega Drive's much-loved six button pad variant will be available for purchase, but only in Japan.\nMega Drive's six button controller released back in 1993 to coincide with the launch of Street Fighter 2: Special Champion Edition and would eventually be supported by over 60 games. Yet despite its enduring popularity around the world - especially among fighting game fans - Sega and Nintendo have opted to make Switch's rendition of the six button pad exclusive to Japan. Everywhere else gets the three button original.\nThis isn't the first time Sega has denied western audience six-button Mega Drive goodness, of course; exactly the same thing happened with the release of its dinky Mega Drive Mini back 2019 to the disappointment of some, with everywhere but Japan having to make do with the three-button pad - Sega presumably reckoning (both then and now) the original offered the most nostalgia value for the majority of western Mega Drive fans.\nRead more",

Oh, and it had some cracking music too.\nAll of that returns in the newly announced ActRaiser Renaissance, which features \"remastered\" 2D new visuals, new stories, expanded action and realm management gameplay, new action stages, a new realm and boss, plus new music - including 15 new tracks and re-arranged original music by Actraiser composer Yuzo Koshiro.

          "description": "Epic's recent antitrust case against Apple - in which it lost all but one of its legal challenges - may be over for now, but the drama continues. Apple has told Epic it won't be reinstating its Fortunite developer account until the appeal process is over - a decision that could mean the battle royale game remains unavailable on Apple devices for years.\nApple initially revoked Epic's Fortnite developer account - blocking Fortnite from being distributed on its devices - last August, after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app - a move Apple has since called an \"intentional breach of contract\".\nEpic appealed the move unsuccessfully, and Fortnite has remained unavailable on Apple devices for the duration of its legal proceedings. However, now the court's judgement has been passed - which included confirmation that Apple is within its rights to keep Fortnite off its App Store - Epic has once again attempted to have its developer account reinstated, this time by appealing directly to Apple.\nRead more",

In a separate email, Blizzard co-leaders Jen Oneal and Mike Ybarra called Sonny \"a thoughtful leader\", and Bloomberg reports employees it spoke to say Sonny was well-respected within the company and that they weren't aware of any allegations against him. An official statement provided to Polygon confirms Sonny's departure, adding he is leaving to \"to take some time off after 5 years of service\".\nSonny - who was overseeing the development of Overwatch 2 - leaves Blizzard almost exactly five months after the high-profile departure of Overwatch director and Blizzard Entertainment vice president Jeff Kaplan.

However, that initial launch window was shifted back to spring 2020, and then to summer 2021, before receiving one last delay to this autumn.\nBut now, with a release date finally confirmed, The Good Life is almost here, meaning players will soon be able to step into the shoes of New York photojournalist Naomi, as she moves to the \"vast and sprawling\" backwoods British town of Rainy Woods to pay off her massive debt.\nRead more",

Gran Turismo 7's campaign leans heavily on the series' past, allowing full modding and customisation of cars, as well as placing a fresh emphasis on the car collecting side with new and used dealerships and an all-new GT Cafe that lends some structure to the hoarding of cars. \nA blog post published in the immediate aftermath of the release date reveal stated that an online connection is required for GT Cafe, something series creator Kazunori Yamauchi was able to expand upon in a recent interview with Eurogamer. \nRead more",
