That’s because you need first to download\nall the data from a source block storage provider to compute and then send\nit back to a storage provider again. There’s a lot of network traffic and CPU/RAM used in this process.\nHardware acceleration by offloading certain expensive operations to dedicated hardware is\nalways a huge performance boost.

However, malicious users quickly began exploiting the feature, setting up dummy accounts and bots to flood the chats of often marginalised streamers and subject them to doxing, harassment, and attack.\nDespite Twitch conceding it needed to \"do more to address these issues\", many streamers were unhappy with what they saw as a continued lack of meaningful response from the company, leading to a successful 24-hour protest last month. Now, however, Twitch is reportedly readying to roll out new security features designed to combat hate raiding.\nRead more",

Each card will attack and take damage from any adjacent enemy cards at the end of a turn, but if there's no card to block an incoming attack, players will take damage directly. Whoever damages their opponent enough will win the game.\nRead more",

Its clever combination of platforming and battle royale made for fun and addictive arcade gameplay, and 24 hours after release it had more than 1.5 million players.

It's a thrilling, richly designed, and all-round fantastic RPG experience, and one that also happens to come in a box big enough to kill a man.\nAs such (plus the fact the original board game retails for around £100), the prospect of a cheaper, more manageable digital iteration of Gloomhaven is an enticing one indeed - and the good news is the PC release, developed by Flaming Fowl Studios, has been widely praised during early access. It isn't quite a 1:1 interpretation (which Flaming Fowl say is neither possible or desirable), but all differences have been discussed with Childres and the end result is a \"very faithful adaptation of the original gameplay and design.\"\nRead more",

Over in Japan, Nintendo also confirmed Mega Drive's much-loved six button pad variant will be available for purchase, but only in Japan.\nMega Drive's six button controller released back in 1993 to coincide with the launch of Street Fighter 2: Special Champion Edition and would eventually be supported by over 60 games. Yet despite its enduring popularity around the world - especially among fighting game fans - Sega and Nintendo have opted to make Switch's rendition of the six button pad exclusive to Japan. Everywhere else gets the three button original.\nThis isn't the first time Sega has denied western audience six-button Mega Drive goodness, of course; exactly the same thing happened with the release of its dinky Mega Drive Mini back 2019 to the disappointment of some, with everywhere but Japan having to make do with the three-button pad - Sega presumably reckoning (both then and now) the original offered the most nostalgia value for the majority of western Mega Drive fans.\nRead more",

Oh, and it had some cracking music too.\nAll of that returns in the newly announced ActRaiser Renaissance, which features \"remastered\" 2D new visuals, new stories, expanded action and realm management gameplay, new action stages, a new realm and boss, plus new music - including 15 new tracks and re-arranged original music by Actraiser composer Yuzo Koshiro.

In a separate email, Blizzard co-leaders Jen Oneal and Mike Ybarra called Sonny \"a thoughtful leader\", and Bloomberg reports employees it spoke to say Sonny was well-respected within the company and that they weren't aware of any allegations against him. An official statement provided to Polygon confirms Sonny's departure, adding he is leaving to \"to take some time off after 5 years of service\".\nSonny - who was overseeing the development of Overwatch 2 - leaves Blizzard almost exactly five months after the high-profile departure of Overwatch director and Blizzard Entertainment vice president Jeff Kaplan. However, despite these significant senior staffing changes, Blizzard insists Overwatch 2 is making \"excellent progress\" and \"is in the final stages of production\", with more to be shared at the Overwatch League Grand Finals this weekend.\nRead more",

Just a couple weeks ago, he said he needed 'just one more hour on a few pieces' in order to 'really finish them'.  We all knew that just wasn't true, though.  Dad would always come visit our house, see some of the paintings he did for us over the years, and would put his nose about an inch from it and say, 'y'know, Jobe, I wish I would have made those blues a little deeper', or 'you know I'd love to just splash a little more shadows on that tree', or 'that really needs a fresh coat of varnish on it'.\"\nRead more",

Unfortunately, Balan Wonderland was met with generally unfavourable reviews and disappointing sales when it launched in April, and Naka confirmed his departure from Square Enix in June. At the time, he told Twitter, \"I'm 55 years old, so I may retire.\"\nIt seems Naka has been busy since then, however, and he's celebrated his birthday today by revealing some of what he's been up to since leaving Square. \"Thank you for your birthday message,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Recently I've started studying programs again, and I'm making a simple game for smartphones with Unity.\"\nRead more",
