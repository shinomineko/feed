Many expect cyber operations to provide independent utility in both warfare and low-intensity competition. Underlying these expectations are broadly shared assumptions that information technology increases operational effectiveness. But a growing body of research shows how cyber operations tend to fall short of their promise. The reason for this shortfall is their subversive mechanism of action. In theory, subversion provides a way to exert influence at lower risks than force because it is secret and indirect, exploiting systems to use them against adversaries. The mismatch between promise and practice is the consequence of the subversive trilemma of cyber operations, whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables. A case study of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict provides empirical support for the argument. Qualitative analysis leverages original data from field interviews, leaked documents, forensic evidence, and local media. Findings show that the subversive trilemma limited the strategic utility of all five major disruptive cyber operations in this conflict...</p></blockquote>",

There is even footage of the shooter - I assume the titular Agent 64 - finishing someone off in a toilet stall.

You see, in The Alters, players take on the role of Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant planet, ensconced in a roving wheel-like base, with a bunch of alternative versions of himself known as Alters. Ultimately, the goal is to stay alive long enough to find a way back home by creating new Alters, each of who have different skills essential for survival.\r\n\n\r\n\"The Alters is a game about life-changing moments,\" explains The Alters' new Steam page. \"Those binary decisions that happen in nanoseconds, but have influence over your entire life. It is about looking into yourself, into your past, and discovering that you are who you are as a sum of those numerous choices. And when you do that a fundamental question arises: WHAT IF...?\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Microsoft showed a new trailer for A Plage Tale: Requiem during the Games Showcase today, giving us another rare look at gameplay in the upcoming sequel, due sometime this year on Xbox Consoles, PC and Game Pass at launch. It's also coming to PS5 but obviously Microsoft glossed over that bit.\nThe thing that really stuck out to me, a fan of the first game, was stabbing. Amicia, the returning older sister of brother Hugo, and our hero, can now approach enemies from the back and stealth-kill them, reaching over and stabbing them multiple times in the neck - the kind of gruesome move we've seen many times in other stealth combat games. Except A Plague Tale, the first game, wasn't really a stealth combat game - it was more about running away and hiding and being smart. That's what made it stand out. \nAmicia also packs a crossbow in the sequel, which she uses, and she can garrotte people with some chord. All she had in the first game was a slingshot, which wasn't entirely capable of one-shot kills. It was more of a utility/distraction tool.\n Read more",

As well as this, Forza Motorsport will also be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass subscription service on day one.\nAlong with this announcement, Dan Greenawalt and the game's director Chris Esaki popped in for a chat about their game. It's the most technically advanced racing game ever apparently, so that's exciting. We also got told about its dynamic time of day feature, the weather for each track and the inclusion of raytracing. This was all shown off with a clip from the fictional circuit known as Maple Valley.\nThe twosome also says there's a 48x improvement in the accuracy of the simulation - but, as Martin has asked, what does that mean, and how does it feel?

We start approaching a spooky church and then head up into the spire where vampires are leaping about. Shotguns and nice vampire-burning-up effects ensue, and then we're off to learn a bit about the town.\r\n\n\r\nThe titular Redfall is an island community in Massachusets apparently, but now the whole place has gone to heck. Vampires have blocked out the sun, drained all the water, and cut the town off. (Wouldn't draining the water do the opposite?) Expect spooky Americana, like a funfair and an old cinema which appears to have the wilderness growing inside. Expect Left 4 Dead-type action as you take on different enemy types.\r\n \nRead more",

Cuphead's second season will, unsurprisingly, continues where its predecessor left often, featuring the further misadventures of Cuphead, Mugman, and friends on Inkwell Isle.\nSeason 2 will feature another 12 15-minute episodes, and a further 12 episodes will follow sometime after that, completing Netflix's previously confirmed three-season, 36 episode run.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, the PlayStation State of Play was pretty good, actually.\r\n\n\r\nAs for Geoff Keighley's show last night, well... there were plenty of announcements in last night's showcase, though few genuine surprises. Here we share our favourites, rate the night overall, and provide our best impressions of the Clickers from The Last of Us.

And I am sorry to say this folks, but that £70/$70 will only get you the base game and its prequel Left Behind.

          "description": "Oi, guv! There's a cracking, cockney, knees-up of a trailer for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide here that shows off some gameplay in the most detail yet. Take a look:\nFor the curious, Darktide is a spiritual follow-up to Fatshark's previous four-player co-op games, Warhammer: Vermintide and Vermintide 2, which are a bit like medieval Left 4 Deads but with giant rats. This one's set in the even grimmer and darker universe of the year 40K.\nAnd it's all quite supremely 40K, by the looks of things. We get a nice glimpse of the four classes - Psyker, Veteran, Zealot, Ogryn - blowing apart the hordes of cultists-cum-space-zombies in different ways.\n Read more",

And not only is it really real, but it will also be releasing as soon as 2nd September for the PlayStation 5 at a retail price of $70. \nTo accompany this news, we got our first look at the remake in action thanks to a brand-new trailer. You can check it out for yourself by following this link.\nAs you can see, the Ellie and Joel that we first met all the way back in 2013 now have a much sleeker look, but it is most certainly still them. There is fighting, there is compassion, and there are enough clickers to give one spores for thought throughout this reveal. Rather nicely, the game's DLC - Left Behind - will also be included in this remake. \n Read more",

          "description": "A new report into the development of Bethesda's widely derided Fallout 76 has painted a picture of a studio in disarray, as poor management, a lack of design direction, and engine challenges created an environment of apathy, confusion, crunch, and burnout, and a game that ultimately failed to resonate with players.\r\n\n\r\nAnnounced in 2018 and launched the following year, Fallout 76 - an online take on Bethesda's beloved post-apocalyptic RPG series - was less than well-received at launch. Eurogamer's Wesley Yin-Poole even went as far as to call it a \"bizarre, boring, broken mess\" before slapping it with an avoid badge.\r\n\n\r\nNow, a lengthy new report from Kotaku - based on conversations with 10 former employees of Bethesda and parent company ZeniMax Media - has shed fresh light on the troubled development that lead to such a poorly received game, one seemingly doomed from the start.\r\n \nRead more",

Reportedly, this somewhat radical shift in focus for the series was to ensure a too-similar sequel didn't eat into the original mini-game compilation's ongoing sales.\r\n \nRead more",

It adds new enemies, fancy new building blocks and some odd new structures, left by past explorers. It's something fans have been wanting to dig into for some time.\r\n\n\r\nMojang originally announced Deep Dark almost two years ago, back at Minecraft Live in 2020. At the time, the biome was set to be part of the game's 2021 Caves and Cliffs Update (an offering that was further reshuffled after Caves and Cliffs was split in two). So, why the delay? What's been happening with Minecraft in the interim? And what's going on with that Jason Momoa Minecraft movie? I sat down with Minecraft's game director Agnes Larsson and gameplay developer Ulraf Vakninthe to find out more.\r\n\n\r\n\"We felt for a while 'this is a risk but we might be able to do it',\" Larsson told me, of Deep Dark's original intended release date. \"But then when we realised [we had to delay], we tried to take the decision really quickly because we would risk making people in the team very, very stressed out. And we also communicated about it really quickly because we wanted to be as transparent as possible about such a big decision. \r\n \nRead more",

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, for example, was the first game ever to receive a perfect score of 40/40 in Famitsu magazine and was recently added to the Video Game Hall of Fame. \nHowever, while great, these games are a product of their time, and as such can look a little rough around the edges. Well, not anymore!\nNow, thanks to an emulator developer that goes by the name of Darío, these legendary games have been given not only ray-tracing upgrades, but also object motion blur, widescreen, DLSS and 60+ FPS.\n Read more",

A mysterious stranger named Rhi, who looks to be a new ally, has instead taken Willow's place while players investigate the emergence of the first Ultra Beasts. \r\n\n\r\nThese creatures are likely the cause of Willow's absence, and will hopefully be a continued focus over the game's new Season of Go. For now at least, Willow's absence appears to be a story development that will stick for some time, with standard in-game text changed throughout the app to remove references to the professor. (For those overly concerned, a Go Fest finale event for existing ticket holders, coming in August, seems likely to revolve around his revival.)\r\n \nRead more",

You can check out the full breakdown below:\r\n\nPlayers in Diablo Immortal have three progression pillars: XP level, equipment level, and Legendary Gems. The first two are pretty standard fare in any RPG-type game, but collating Legendary Gems can be a costly and convoluted process as the way you get them is randomised and often exceedingly rare... and right now, it seems as though F2P players cannot earn them at all.\r\n \nRead more",

Along with the promise of hidden riches, something else strange is going on, as \"an alarming number of froglets are disappearing around the world\".

These areas are Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and, what with this being a game with an out of this world entity roaming through its maps, the Moon. \nBut, who exactly will players come across within these vast maps? Well, as Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is set in the swinging '60s, you will have to deal with more than a small handful of hippies on your quest for glory. Oh, yes, and there is also the small matter of the KGB as well. You can check out the latest trailer for Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed below.\n Read more",

          "description": "Among the various announcements revealed this weekend as part of Star Wars Celebration, we got news of a Lego BD-1 from Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (arguably the best thing about the game) headed our way.\nThe new model, which is set to release on 1st August, will have 1062 pieces, and on completion will stand at 31cm. And he won't just be a static companion to add to your collection. Rather, he will have a head that can be \"tilted back, forward and sideways for maximum cuteness\".\nAs well as the ability to pose BD-1, those who purchase their own little droid companion this summer will also get to experience other neat little inclusions, such as the back of BD-1's head being translucent to show the droid's mood and a display sign (see below). He probably won't be able to heal you like he does for Cal, however. \n Read more",

But with Elden Ring having been out in the wild for over two months now, the Dark Souls community was steadily to lose its patience as further updates failed to materialised.\r\n \nRead more",

That, however, is no longer the case, with Schofield now saying it's its \"own story and world\".\r\n\n\r\nThe Callisto Protocol is a third-person horror game set in 2320, with its action unfolding within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter's moon Callisto. While that set-up mightn't immediately scream PUBG to onlookers, the connection came from the fact developer Striking Distance was explicitly established by PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton to create narrative-driven games that would expand the universe introduced in the battle royale hit.\r\n\n\r\nAs Schofield explained in a recent GameInformer cover feature on The Callisto Protocol, \"When we came in, [Krafton] had a lore team and they were writing this big story, like, 'Where does PUBG start? Where does it fit in?'\". Had those plans continued, the horror game would have sat \"pretty far out\" along the timeline, but somewhere during development the idea was dropped.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Minecraft's long-awaited The Wild Update - which includes two new biomes, new mobs, and various other delights - finally has a release date, and will be launching on 7th June.\r\n\n\r\nThe Wild Update's first major addition comes in the form of the new Mangrove Swamp biome, bringing mangrove trees and a new natural (and craftable) resource known as mud blocks. It also ushers in the highly anticipated Deep Dark biome, which was originally due to launch as part of the Caves & Cliffs update before getting delayed.\r\n\n\r\nThe Deep Dark biome, as its name very much implies, is Minecraft's deepest area to date, and is found beneath the game's current bedrock layer. Here, curious adventures will uncover remnants of a ruined civilisation as well as creepy, eyeless mobs known as Wardens. These fearsome foes react to vibrations, meaning stealth is the key to survival, and can also be summoned if careless explorers stumble into the new Shrieker traps.\r\n \nRead more",

You can pick up the base game and almost all its DLC on PC for around £16 in the latest Humble charity bundle.\r\n\n\r\nCities: Skylines was a solidly entertaining city builder when it released all the way back in 2015, but seven years of expansions and other post-launch DLC haved created a game of truly amazing scope. However, getting your hands on absolutely everything that's released thus far is, inevitably, an extremely pricey undertaking even during sale season.\r\n\n\r\nHop over to the Humble Store right now though, and you can pick up publisher Paradox Interactive's Cities: Skylines Colossal Collection. This features a total of 32 items (usually costing £204.39), including the base game, plus its After Dark, Snowfall, Natural Disasters, Mass Transit, Green Cities, Parklife, Industries, Campus, and Sunset Harbour expansions.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As part of its latest earnings report, CD Projekt has offered an revised breakdown of the projects currently occupying the studio's time, confirming the \"bulk of\" its development capacity is now focused on Cyberpunk 2077's story expansion, which is still expected to launch next year.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing Cyberpunk's disastrous release at the tail-end of 2020, the majority of CD Projekt's development resources (as shown in the chart below) were focused on remedying the game's most pressing issues. At the same time, a smaller team was working on its next-gen release, promised long before the project's launch woes, and an even smaller group was doing preliminary work on its paid expansion.\r\n\n\r\nInevitably, those numbers have shifted considerably over time - less than half of CD Projekt's development staff were working on Cyberpunk's base game and next-gen update by June last year, for instance - and that trend has, unsurprisingly, continued. As per today's financial results, Cyberpunk 2077 support has \"shrunk considerably\" following the release of its next-gen update (which CD Projekt says had \"a positive effect on the game's perception and sales figures\"), with the \"bulk of [the studio's] development capacity\" now working on its expansion.\r\n \nRead more",

And today's addition, titled Leviathan, is a very different proposition to April's The Blighted, and sounds considerably more ambitious - and significantly weirder - than any of the expeditions we've seen before. \nThat said, Leviathan begins in much the same way as previous expeditions, dropping all players into one location. However, what follows is something closer to a roguelike experience, stripping explorers of their progress whenever they die. The narrative twist, though, is that players are actually stuck in a mysterious time loop, and the entire community will need to work together to find a way to break free.\n Read more",

          "description": "Battlefield is as famous for its troubled launches as it is its sandbox multiplayer, but even by its own standards 2042 has been something of a disaster - lumpy, incomplete and with some less than popular decisions along the way such as the expansive maps designed to accommodate the newly expanded 128 player count and the introduction of specialists. \r\n\n\r\nDICE at least does have some previous in turning around a shaky ship - Battlefield 4 went from a disastrous launch to become one of the most celebrated in the series - and is making the right noises ahead of the belated launch of Battlefield 2042's first season next month. \r\n\n\r\nWhile we're not yet privy to the full reveal, a discussion between creative director Lars Gustavsson, senior producer Ryan McArthur and community manager Freeman outlined the studio's commitment to Battlefield 2042 - interesting itself in light of comments made by EA boss Andrew Wilson to investors earlier this month that suggested development on the series is being rethought - as well as what changes to expect. \r\n \nRead more",

The big gambit this year, if you're unaware, is an ongoing, season-spanning narrative that will progress across monthly in-game story episodes known as Adventures.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a promising idea that so far doesn't really seem to have found its footing, with Seas of Thieves' initial set of Adventures having felt decidedly undercooked, both in terms of their challenges and narrative presentation.

What is its full game list? How good will its streaming be? And how soon should we expect newer games like Ratchet & Clank and Horizon Forbidden West to turn up on the service? \nThe biggest difference between PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass is, of course, the lack of big new first-party games launching into Plus on day one. But, with Starfield's delay to 2023, Microsoft might not have any on Game Pass this year either. How will Xbox counter?

The game also lacks parental controls, Harris complained.\r\n \nRead more",

That doesn't mean it'll be heavy going, though; Amanita says Phonopolis will explore its subject matter in a \"playful and light-hearted\" way.\n Read more",

          "description": "Last week, I got to have a closer look at the Saints Row reboot from Volition. As you would expect, it looked bombastic and eclectic, with a myriad of unusual ideas that can only really be married together in a Saints Row game.\nHowever, at this point, it also felt like Volition has focused a bit too much on adding in all this \"stuff\" to the game, and seemingly at the cost of some polish and finesse. Saints Row was confirmed to be a cross-gen release on its initial announcement last year, and that seems to be a fair market for it. Right now, it just looks and feels like more of a last-gen game than a current one.\nThroughout the showcase, Saints Row's fighting appeared to be a touch clunky, while its cutscenes and dialogue felt more forced than we may expect from a game today. Meanwhile, during a close up of the Boss' face, you could clearly see that the character's eyelashes and eyelids did not match up in the way you would expect them to. This could be a bug that will be fixed by launch, but it was nonetheless jarring on the eye (mine, not the Boss', although their eye did look jarred as well).\n Read more",

It also proved to be an ingenious puzzler beneath all that - tasking players with manipulating portals to navigate increasingly devious challenges - and one that still holds up wonderfully today.\r\n\n\r\nThe currently in-development Portal demake, officially known as Portal 64, is the work of developer James Lambert, and is ambitiously attempting to pack the entire experience of Valve's classic - memes, portals, puzzles, and all - down onto Nintendo hardware that preceded its release by over a decade.\r\n \nRead more",

At the time, the developer called the move a \"direct attack on human rights\", adding that \"standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values\".\nHowever, in light of reports that Sony is refusing to authorise any public statements its PlayStation studios might want to make around the issue of reproductive rights, some Bungie fans have questioned whether the developer will still be able to express its opinion so freely once its acquisition by Sony is complete.\n Read more",

It's being called a new standalone \"platform\" for the series, consisting of several key parts; there's a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.\r\n\n\r\nReforger's sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia's previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer's latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.\r\n \nRead more",
