At the time, the studio said a 60fps \"performance mode\" would be added at some point after release - although it's doubtful many were expecting it to take five moths to arrive.\r\n\n\r\nRedfall's performance mode comes as part of a substantial update for Xbox Series X/S and PC touching on everything from gameplay and performance to accessibility. Patch notes promise \"improved PC performance and stability across a wide range of hardware configurations\", for instance, alongside fixes for memory crashes and graphical corruption on AMD GPUs.\r\n \nRead more",

It is by Out of the Blue, the same studio that gave us 2020's rather special Call of the Sea, and set in the \"retro-futuristic '70 metropolis\" Arcadia.\r\n\n\r\nOn the outside, Arcadia seems to promise its residents a life of cushy luxury, but all is not what it seems. In fact, the Arcadia residents are all part of a TV show, and they have no idea they are being recorded for the entertainment of the wider public (think The Truman Show). But, it is not all as innocent as that (not that that is especially innocent, really). You see, if the viewers don't like someone, well, it could end in their death.

However, the developer has pushed it back until an unspecified time in mid-October. This, the Payday 3 team has said, is to \"ensure its stability\".\r\n\n\r\n\"The patch needs some changes that would require us to go through console certification again,\" Starbreeze explained.

From tech giants such as Microsoft and Epic Games down to development studios such as Telltale Games, the bad news just keeps on coming. \nWe discussed the job losses at Creative Assembly last week following the cancellation of Hyenas. Since then, we've heard of deep cuts at Team17, and more job losses on Dragon Age.

These services will be terminated \"as of early April 2024,\" the company wrote in an update earlier today. \r\n\n\r\nNintendo has been steadily winding down its support for these older consoles, having sunsetted the eShop for both platforms last year. Of course, this had no effect on the online play capabilities of the games. \r\n\n\r\nHowever, as of April next year, games on either the Wii U or 3DS will only be playable offline. This means \"online cooperative play, internet rankings and data distribution\" will also be affected. It also means no more online town hopping in Animal Crossing: New Leaf (pictured above).\r\n \nRead more",

Previously mob votes have resulted in the likes of the Glow Squid, Panda, Phantom, Llama, and Sniffer all ending up in-game, and the crab is now vying for a place in that illustrious line-up.\r\n\n\r\nAs per Mojang's animated video introducing the crab, should voters shunt the little fella into first place, it'll be found within the mangrove swamp biome. We're also told about its crab claw, which, once acquired, will enable players to place blocks further away than would normally be possible - a bit of a builder-focused utility, then, this one.\r\n \nRead more",

This image was shared as part of a blog post about GTA Online which - on the surface at least - was all fairly standard stuff.\r\n\n\r\nBut it's the Moon Festival image which is getting attention - as some fans believe Rockstar is actually teasing the series' next entry in this seemingly straightforward picture. \r\n \nRead more",

The likes of co-op play, new buildings, new production chains, and other improvements are expected to arrive in the six months or so of development planned ahead of a full 1.0 release.\r\n \nRead more",

But in addition to all this, Among Us VR on PS VR2 will also include new tasks and new features designed specfically for virtual reality. This includes 3D cosmetics, proximity voice chat, accessibility and comfort settings, safety and in-game moderation tools, crossplay compatibility, and custom lobby settings. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "How do you follow up a five-star treat like Dave the Diver? With a zombie-themed, 16-player PvPvE stealth-survival extraction game, of course! Developer Mintrocket has just unveiled its next project, titled Nakwon: Last Paradise, and it's about as much a departure from its acclaimed snorkelling-and-sushi-restaurant-management adventure as you can get, dropping players onto the streets of Seoul, right into the middle of the undead apocalypse.\r\n\n\r\nAs per Mintrocket's lengthy Steam announcement, Nakwon's action is split into two main parts; on the Scouting side, players - with a friend in tow if desired - must leave the relative comforts of the titular safe zone to venture into the zombie-infested outskirts of Seoul. Here, the goal is to scavenge resources then escape back to safety, but other players and, of course, the AI-controlled undead, won't make that an easy task. \r\n\n\r\nMintrocket stresses that zombies in Nakwon are very much the hunters, and cannot be defeated. Instead, players - primarily armed with makeshift weaponry and tools rather than undead-shredding firepower, given the scarcity of guns - must navigate the streets as stealthily as possible to avoid detection, fleeing when necessary. And should they successfully make it back to the safe zone alive (it looks like players can come and go as they like, regardless of what other Survivors might be doing) the Simulation side of Nakwon begins.\r\n \nRead more",

And ahead of its arrival, Netflix has shared a fresh trailer showcasing its chaotic action, this one welcoming Rayman and a bunch of other familiar Ubisoft faces.\r\n\n\r\nCaptain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix takes its cue from Ubisoft's gleefully ludicrous, 80s-inspired Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon. It's set in an alternate version of Earth's 1992 where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data.\r\n\n\r\nEnter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before sailing off into the sunset with his boyfriend Alex. Unfortunately, Laserhawk is betrayed by said boyfriend, landing him in high-security facility with no choice but to join forces with an unlikely bunch of rebels.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Roughly two years after Netflix announced plans for a Tomb Raider anime, we've finally been given our first look at Lara Croft in cartoon action. \r\n\n\r\nThe Tomb Raider animation is set to focus on the events following the reboot trilogy's conclusion. Lara has returned from her travels in South America, having prevented an apocalypse of some description, and is now ready for her next adventure. \r\n\n\r\nNetflix's debut trailer is quite brief, featuring a lot of heavy breathing from our heroine over the top of a handful of impactful shots. We get to see Lara abseiling into a cavernous abyss and - perhaps in homage to one of Shadow of the Tomb Raider's better moments - emerging onto the scene while a backdrop of flames silhouettes her (presumably) rather battle weary figure. There is also a nice little nod to the Yamatai crew from the 2013 reboot, with Lara tenderly stroking a photo of her fallen friends (although, no Alex? And, I know Jonah is still alive).\r\n \nRead more",

Citing undisclosed \"sources\", the website says Far Cry 7, codenamed Project Blackbird, will feature a \"non-linear\" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.\r\n\n\r\nSupposedly, the main goal of Far Cry 7 is to bring down the Sons of Truth, described as a \"conspiracy group\", within that time frame (the timer is said to stop while within certain locations, such as safehouses), but it's claimed players will also need to track down and rescue their family members along the way in order to \"100%\" the game.\r\n \nRead more",

But the impact these have on your character is now fairly minimal - whereas previously this system would have seen players having to swap spacesuits to meet local conditions.\r\n\n\r\nBethesda boss Todd Howard revealed the change during an episode of the Game Maker's Notebook podcast, which is well worth a watch. In it, Howard discusses the challenges of creating interesting planets, fun space combat, and what changed during Starfield's development.\r\n \nRead more",

The end result was an experience that thoroughly reinvigorated the two-decade old classics, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman even going as far as to call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 \"one of the best games of the generation\".\r\n\n\r\nIn the three years since its record-breaking release, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has made the jump to Switch, and developer Vicarious Visions (the esteemed studio responsible for the superb remakes) was merged into Blizzard - a move that sadly meant a planned Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 ultimately never saw the light of day.\r\n \nRead more",

Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle 'rooms' that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress.\r\n\n\r\nAs for The Talos Principle 2, it sounds like players can expect more of the same, and generally more all round. Croteam is promising new abilities, including gravity manipulation and mind transference, on top of the mechanics seen in the first game, and it'll all take place across \"more than a dozen\" new environments - said to be hiding long-buried secrets and forgotten history - that range from a city on the brink of a paradigm shift to the landscapes of a mysterious island.\r\n \nRead more",

After significant outrage from the development community, with many accusing Unity of a betrayal of trust, the company changed course, saying its new pricing plan would now only apply to developers choosing to use its next Long Term Support version - but, as highlighted by developer Neognosis in a post announcing the cancellation of a Switch port for its acclaimed F-Zero-inspired racer BallisticNG, many developers might not have a choice but to upgrade.\r\n \n\r\n\"Nintendo has a rolling Unity version requirement for game releases,\" the studio explained, \"and we're already behind the threshold by two years. Two weeks ago this wouldn't have been an issue... [but] by the time we'll have a Switch version of BallisticNG ready, the threshold for Unity versions will exceed the new versions that Unity are pushing their TOS changes with, and we currently have no confidence that they won't try pulling another move or pushing back to their original plans under/beyond this new TOS.\"\r\n \nRead more",

This was not because he had just used his web-tastic athleticism to save a school bus of children from careering off the side of the road, or swept MJ off her feet (literally) before kissing her while upside down. \r\n\n\r\nRather, he was a topic of conversation because Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games remastered its original 2018 game for the PlayStation 5, and at the same time changed up the look of its unmasked hero, Peter Parker. \r\n\n\r\nWhile Insomniac said this new model was a better reflection of actor Yuri Lowenthal's facial capture, it caused a certain amount of upset for fans of the original. In fact, when the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man released last year, mods were made to bring Peter Parker's original face back into the game. But, perhaps we should all be less concerned about the two different facial models for Peter and move on. After all, that's what his actor wants. In fact, he just wants people to \"get over it\".\r\n \nRead more",

It's coming from Wētā Workshop and Private Division and will arrive sometime next year. Needless to say, I am more than a little bit excited.\r\n\n\r\nTo accompany this announcement, a small teaser was also released. It is short and suitably charming, showing a young person humming as she sits at a table strewn with flora and art supplies. There are also modern bits and pieces, such as headphones. She is painting in a book, and while I have nothing to base this on other than my hunch, she looks to be painting herself as a hobbit. Could this be Tales of the Shire's soon to be pint-sized protagonist? \r\n \nRead more",

The archer, meanwhile, is better suited to taking down enemies - which are said to be behave organically out the world - from a distance using their bow and arrow, which can support the likes of exploding and blighting arrows.\r\n \nRead more",

It also revealed email exchanges between Microsoft's execs, where Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond and others discussed potential games for the company's Game Pass subscription service. \r\n\n\r\nOne such game was Baldur's Gate 3, the recent hit from developer Larian. As we previously reported, Microsoft estimated it would take $5m to get Baldur's Gate 3 on Game Pass, with the company dubbing the game a \"second-run Stadia PC RPG\".\r\n\n\r\nNeedless to say, given the huge success of Baldur's Gate 3, Microsoft underestimated its potential. But Larian isn't mad about this. Rather, it has said it understands the situation, with the studio's director of publishing Michael Douse saying it \"comes with the genre\".\r\n \nRead more",

All are along for the ride in Bluey: The Videogame, which promises an \"interactive sandbox adventure\" for up to four players, featuring fully explorable recreations of some of the show's most recognisable locations.\r\n\n\r\nThere's talk of \"story-driven episodic gameplay\", split into four parts, that'll include activities and mini-games inspired by the cartoon - Keepy Uppy and Magic Xylophone are mentioned - with players able to unlock new costumes, stickers, episodes, and locations as they go.\r\n \nRead more",

April saw the previously Epic Games Store-exclusive title make the jump to Steam on PC, but content updates fizzled out after that - and now Saber Interactive has confirmed development has reached its end.\r\n \nRead more",

To help Peter and Miles swing across the larger map, they can now use web wings to traverse faster. The game uses a new fast travel system which is unlocked through the district progress systesm, and Insomniac says players will experience \"very little downtime\" when using fast travel.\nThe HUD for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 looks more organic, as markers for activities and quests players have already discovered will appear across New York City. This is explained in-game as AR technology in the lenses of the Spider-Masks which, given the technology already used by characters in the Spider-Man universe, Peter and Miles probably sorely need. \n Read more",

It also brings changes to loot, items, and crafting, as well as UI and UX improvements, and a new selection of radio stations.\r\n\n\r\nIn other words, Cyberpunk's 2.0 update touches on a broad range of core systems in a significant fashion - and CD Projekt has been attempting to explain how these changes will impact the experience across a recent series of developer streams.\r\n \nRead more",

Either way, the important thing here is that no core game purchase will be required, and EA is also keen to add there'll be no subscription and no \"energy mechanics\" - so that's at least one predatory mobile monetisation tactic off the table.\r\n\n\r\nAs to what a new mainline Sims game designed from the ground-up to be free-to-play might look like, a Project Rene job listing hastily removed from EA's website earlier this year pointed to an in-game marketplace featuring official and user-generated content (both free and paid) - something else EA has now more or less confirmed.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Apple has revealed its new iPhone 15 line-up, bringing the news that its ray-tracing-enabled iPhone 15 Pro will be getting native versions of some AAA titles - including Capcom's Resident Evil 4 Remake and Ubisoft's upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage - over the next 12 months.\r\n\n\r\nThe newly unveiled iPhone 15 starts at £799 with 128GB storage, and features a 6.1\" Super Retina XDR display (bumped up to 6.7\" if you opt for the £899 \"Plus\" model), an aluminium body, the A16 Bionic Chip with 5-core GPU, and a 4x optical dual camera system capable of taking photos at up to 48MP. It'll also ditch Apple's proprietary Lighting port in favour of USB-C to comply with upcoming EU regulations. \r\n\n\r\nThe pricier iPhone 15 Pro model (starting at £999 with 128GB storage) is where things get a little more interesting for gaming. Its specs are broadly similar to the standard model (the £1,199 Pro Max even has the 6.7\" screen), but it switches in a 10x optical \"telephoto\" camera zoom, titanium body, and the A17 Pro chip with 6-core GPU.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Unity has announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model which will see it introduce a monthly fee per new game install beginning on 1st January next year - a move that has drawn considerable criticism from the development community.\r\n\n\r\nUnity - the engine behind countless acclaimed games including Tunic, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Citizen Sleeper, RimWorld, Outer Wilds, Fall Guys, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Cities: Skylines - was previously licenced to developers using a royalty free model built around subscription tiers. Anyone whose revenue or funding was less than $100k over the course of the year (and who didn't want access to features such as the ability to remove the Unity splash screen) could stick to the free Unity Personal licence, while a Unity Plus subscription was required up to $200k in revenue, and a Unity Pro or above subscription was needed for more.\r\n\n\r\nAs of 1st January, 2024, however, developers will be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install - seemingly including re-installs and installs across multiple devices - on top of their existing licence subscription, with those fees kicking in for titles that have made $200k or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200k lifetime game installs. Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers, meanwhile, will see the fees applied after passing the $1m revenue and 1m lifetime installs threshold.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, guess what? Anything is possible in this darkest of timelines.\r\n\n\r\nThe official Xbox credit card will soon be a thing, albeit only in the US for the time being, having been conjured into existence through a partnership between Microsoft and Mastercard. It'll initially be available exclusively to Xbox Insiders (it's expected to expand to all US-based Xbox players starting next year) and offers one of those reward-based scheme things, which - and I'm not sure there's a nicer way of putting this - essentially incentivises people to increase their debt, so, you know, please use responsibly and all that.\r\n\n\r\nBasically, everyday purchases made on the card will steadily accrue points that can be spent on games and add-ons via Xbox.com, but an initial purchase using the card will also reward cardholders with 5,000 points (equating to $50 USD), plus three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Only new members are eligible for that three-month deal, incidentally, but it can be gifted to other people if you're already a Game Pass subscriber yourself.\r\n \nRead more",
