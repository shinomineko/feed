It should also help the wider community avoid similar attacks in the future. In pursuit of these goals, technical practitioners are increasingly influenced by stakeholders like cyber insurers and lawyers. This paper explores these impacts via a multi-stage, mixed methods research design that involved 69 expert interviews, data on commercial relationships, and an online validation workshop. The first stage of our study established 11 stylized facts that describe how cyber insurance sends work to a small numbers of IR firms, drives down the fee paid, and appoints lawyers to direct technical investigators. The second stage showed that lawyers when directing incident response often: introduce legalistic contractual and communication steps that slow-down incident response; advise IR practitioners not to write down remediation steps or to produce formal reports; and restrict access to any documents produced...</p></blockquote>",

This is merely the progression of a trend that began at the end of the 1970s with the introduction of the first electronic engine control units; today, code controls a car&#8217;s engine and transmission (or its electric motors and battery pack), the steering, brakes, suspension, interior and exterior lighting, and more, depending on how new (and how expensive) it is.

Researchers and programmers immediately started modifying it, improving it, and getting it to do things no one else anticipated. And their results have been immediate, innovative, and an indication of how the future of this technology is going to play out.

I think it poses a similar risk to pandemics and nuclear war&#8212;which is to say, a risk worth taking seriously, but not something to panic over. Which is what I thought the statement said...</p>",

The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you&#8217;ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans­&#8212;one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn&#8217;t misinterpreted the instructions it has received.

A little oddly, Square Enix decided not to showcase Final Fantasy 16 - the one which actually goes on sale in a couple of weeks. Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty was also missing, as was host Geoff Keighley's best pal Hideo Kojima. Once the conference concluded, discussion online focused on the lack of any women on stage, following appearances by a string of male developers - and also Nic Cage.\nOn the upside, no one unexpectedly walked on stage and got arrested. So, how do we feel about all that, and how would we rate the conference overall? Was it a satisfying alternative to E3? Or are we hoping for more now from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom over the coming days? Joining me to discuss all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.\n Read more",

But those that stuck around post-Keighley were, as is fast becoming tradition, rewarded with another batch of intriguing indie titles, courtesy of this year's Day of the Devs stream - and if you missed it, the whole thing can be perused in one convenient, easily digestible round-up below.\r\n\nBeastieball\n\r\nBeastieball is a new RPG from Wishes Unlimited, the studio behind the acclaimed Wondersong and Chicory. This time around, the team is turning its attention to what looks something like Pokémon with its combat replaced by a strategic, turn-based take on volleyball. It sees players, in the role of a coach, touring the world and signing up Beasties they encounter to join their team and take on rivals in bouts of Beastieball. Loads of Beasties are promised, and they can all form friendships that'll create unique combos for use in matches. This one might still be a little way off, though - a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign launches soon.\r\n \nRead more",

When lawlessness breaks out over rising water costs, a sheriff approaches some local demons to strike a bargain.\r\n\n\r\nWhat this means from the game's reveal is an action game set in what looks like a large open world. Players explore in everything from hoverbikes to tanks and even on the backs of dinosaurs. There's elaborate futuristic weaponry and fast third-person combat.

Unfortunately, its development was forced to end prematurely in 2018 amid a lawsuit relating to the ownership of the Friday the 13th licence, and 2020 bought the news Gun would be decommissioning the game's dedicated servers, reverting to the peer-to-peer networking favoured at launch.\r\n\n\r\nSince then, with no new content in development, Friday the 13th: The Game has largely remained out of the spotlight, but, now, Gun has confirmed - in a statement shared on Twitter - the game'll no longer be available to purchase, either digitally or physically, once its licence expires on 31st December 2023. There's some small solace for owners, however, in that the developer says the game will remain playable through \"at least\" 31st December 2024.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "ThroughLine Games, the studio behind the acclaimed Forgotton Anne, has unveiled Forgotlings, an equally gorgeous \"spiritual sequel\" that's just launched a Kickstarter campaign.\r\n\n\r\nForgotlings, like its predecessor, takes place in a \"magical realm inhabited by things we have lost and forgotten\", where sentient creatures - the Forgotlings - live in search of a purpose.\r\n\n\r\nHowever, despite its shared universe, Forgotlings looks to be something of a new beginning in both story and gameplay terms. It casts players as Fig, a \"gifted posing doll\", thrust into a world caught in a conflict between five mighty tribes. Fig will need to unite each tribe to save the world from destruction at the hands of an \"enigmatic Beast\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The first major Counter-Strike 2 update has arrived since the game launched as a limited test in March, bringing with it a radical new loadout system, new buy mechanics and - finally! - a new map for testing purposes, Mirage. \nThe loadout system has the potential to be the most disruptive change, as you can now choose five each of pistols, rifles and \"mid-tier\" (SMG/shotgun) weapons to take into a match. Previously, weapons like the silenced and unsilenced M4 were assigned to the same category, so you would have to go without one of them - but here, you could sacrifice one of the less-used rifles to have both options available. This change has been requested by players for a long time, and would also make it easier for developers Valve to add new weapons in the future, so it's a big win in my book. \nWhen Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first appeared more than a decade ago, it sported a radial buy menu designed to mesh nicely to gamepad controls - after all, the game was originally intended to buy a console-focused iteration of the franchise. That menu has been replaced in the new Counter-Strike 2 update, in favour of a simpler grid-based buy menu that shows your teammate's purchases. Crucially, it's now possible to refund unused weapons, armour and grenades before buy time expires at the start of each round, saving you from the ignoble fate of spending all your hard-earned cash on a weapon you bought accidentally - always a pain given the importance of Counter-Strike's round-to-round economy system. \n Read more",

          "description": "If you've squeezed every last drop of spade-based fun from developer Vine and Yacht Club Games' Shovel Knight spin-off Pocket Dungeon, help is at hand! The extremely enjoyable adventure is poised to receive its \"gigantic\" free Puzzler's Pack DLC next Tuesday, 6th June.\r\n\n\r\nShovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon, if you're unfamiliar, sees the titular spade-wielding hero try his hand at block-falling puzzle-action. Across a procession of single-screen dungeons, players must dodge perpetually tumbling enemies and obstacles then smack chains of them into oblivion, keeping things clear long enough to eventually escape. It's a lot more nuanced than that, though, and clever enough that Eurogamer's Christian Donlan slapped its \"lovely balance of precision and chaos\" with a Recommended badge in 2022.\r\n\nAnyway, the already surprisingly ample package is set to expand again on Tuesday, when Pocket Dungeon's Puzzler's Pack DLC arrives on PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile via Netflix. It adds Puzzle Knight and Mona as playable chracters - the first able to rotate surrounding foes clockwise to create new combos, the latter armed with alchemist abilities that can explode nearby potions - plus new battles, boons, bosses, feats, and a \"ton\" of relics.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a bit of an underwhelming follow-up, but it does offer a couple of improvements, including larger maps, more diverse biomes, and a new Chaos Theory mode revisiting key movie moments.\r\n\n\r\nTrek to Yomi (PS4, PS5), meanwhile, comes from Shadow Warrior studio Flying Wild Hog, and takes players on an striking black-and-white adventure inspired by cinema's classic samurai tales. In more practical terms, it blends side-scrolling platforming with sword combat - a mixture that didn't quite grab Eurogamer's Robert Purchese when he took a look last year.\r\n \nRead more",

It's widely considered to be the granddaddy of the survival horror genre, pioneering the fixed-camera spook-house formula that would go on to influence the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill.\r\n\n\r\nTHQ Nordic's reimagined version of Alone in the Dark - which is being handled by Swedish developer Pieces Interactive with Soma and Amnesia: The Dark Descent writer Mikael Hedberg at the helm - takes the basic premise of the 1992 original, in which private detective Edward Carnby helps Emily Hartwood investigate her uncle's suicide at the gloomy Derceto Mansion, and cranks up the Southern Gothic as it attempts to filter the originals' blend of exploration, combat, puzzles, and story through a more modern lens.\r\n \nRead more",

It was a wonderfully refreshing thing, taking everything you'd expect from an action-RPG - real-time combat, dungeon crawling, and equipment progression - and turning it into a breezy, super-streamlined, pick-up-and-play package. It also had more cat puns than is probably legal.\r\n\n\r\nA sequel arrived two years later, offering a slightly evolved take on the original's formula - most notably introducing dogs (and, yes, dog puns) - and now The Gentlebros is getting ready to do it all over again in Cat Quest: Pirates of the Purribean.\r\n \nRead more",

An accompanying blog post offers only a little more detail. \r\n\n\r\nConcord will be a PVP first-person shooter set in space, headed to PS4 and PS5 in 2024. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There were plenty of announcements during Sony's Playstation Showcase last night, but the one that stood out most to me was Phantom Blade Zero. This quickfire action RPG looks brilliant and oh so slick. It blends Chinese martial arts and punk together, to create a new direction its developer has dubbed \"Kungfupunk\".\r\n\n\r\nIn Phantom Blade Zero, you take on the role of Soul. According to Soulframe Liang, founder of the game's developer S-Game, Soul is \"an elite assassin serving an elusive but powerful organisation known simply as 'The Order'.\" Soul was framed for the murder of this organisation's patriarch, and was then wounded in the \"manhunt that ensued\". Thankfully, he was saved from death by a \"mystic healer\". \r\n\n\r\nThis all sounds enticing enough already, in my opinion, but there is more. While Soul may have been saved by this healer, there is a catch - the cure only lasts for 66 days, and Soul needs to find out who framed him for killing The Order's patriarch before time runs out. Of course, this will not be an easy job, and Soul will have to fight against \"powerful foes and inhuman monstrosities\" on his journey. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Well! Bungie has finally unveiled its next project, and it's quite a surprise, whisking the developer back to its 90s roots for a revival of its classic first-person shooter series Marathon, reimagined as a PvP shooter for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Marathon released in 1994 and went on to spawn two sequels, at which point Microsoft swooped in to purchase Bungie and the Halo franchise was born. Since then, Bungie has been on a quite the journey, working its way through multiple Halo sequels and two Destiny games, the latter of which have kept the studio busy for over a decade. So it's kind of fascinating to see it cast its gaze backward for its first new project as a Sony-owned studio.\r\n\n\r\nThe new Marathon is described as a \"sci-fi PvP extraction shooter\" featuring \"evolving, persistent zones\" that, while not a direct sequel to the earlier games, is set in the same universe. \"PvP\" is the key here, too with Bungie confirming it won't have a single-player campaign. It will, however, support cross-play and cross-save between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\r\n \nRead more",

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the show's popularity, Netflix confirmed that instead of winding the series down it had instead recast the lead role, with Liam Hemsworth stepping into Geralt of Rivia's shoes for season 4 onward.\r\n\n\r\nNow, however, in an interview with Total Film (thanks Games Radar), showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich has confirmed the team was given the option to wrap the series up with Cavill's departure, but instead opted to press on. \"I mean, we had the choice to have Geralt exit and to end the show,\" Hissirch explained, \"[but] that's not something that we were willing to do.

Niantic said it had made these changes with the future of Pokémon Go in mind, and to ensure the game was still focused on its core pillars of exploration and social interaction.\r\n\n\r\nBut alongside criticism of Niantic's decision - which Steranka told Eurogamer last week in an interview that he had fully expected - the company's employees have also been targeted with personal abuse.

          "description": "Summer Game Fest is almost upon us, kicking off with a live showcase before splintering into a \"season\" of disparate publisher events in the absence of E3. But first that showcase, which is now confirmed to be two hours in length, and featuring at least a couple of \"pretty big\" things.\r\n\n\r\nSummer Game Fest gets underway on 8th June, with a live show consisting of premieres, gameplay demos, and announcements. That's pretty much as far as details went in previous teases, but now, in an interview on the Epic Games Store, show host and producer Geoff Keighley has now shared a little more about what to expect from the format.\r\n\n\r\nAlongside its now confirmed two-hour duration, Keighley suggests Summer Game Fest live will be a little more laidback compared to the bombastic Game Awards, offering a \"chance to talk to the developers and showcase games and give a little bit more context around games\". While the exact line-up still appears to be in flux, Keighley does say he expects the Summer Game Fest live show to feature three or four things that are \"pretty big for this audience.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Lars Gustavsson, former creative director on DICE's long-running Battlefield series, has unveiled his new studio TTK Games, which is currently developing an online shooter.\r\n\n\r\nGustavsson departed DICE last September after more than 20 years at the studio, having - as EA wrote in its announcement - \"decided he is ready for a new adventure\". Gustavsson offered no suggestion of what that new adventure might be at the time, but all has now been revealed.\r\n\n\r\nGustavsson's new studio, the Stockholm-based TTK Games, has been co-founded by four former members of DICE; Gustavsson will serve as CEO and creative director, while Daniel Berlin (previously lead world designer and design director on Battlefield) is senior design director. They're joined by chief technical officer and technical director Vidar Nygren (technical director on Battlefield), plus art director Peter Hoyles, who served as studio art director at DICE LA.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Yuke's, the renowned Japanese developer responsible for nearly two decades of popular WWE games, marks its return to the wrestling genre next month, when AEW: Fight Forever launches fo Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 29th June.\r\n\n\r\nYuke's has been associated wrestling ever since its inception in 1995, and the studio's long association with WWE began in 2000, with the launch of WWF SmackDown. It continued to work on the WWE licence until 2018's WWE 2K19, when publisher 2K decided to hand the reins exclusively to the US-based Visual Concepts, which had co-developed the series with Yuke's since 2013. Unfortunately, Visual Concepts' solo debut proved so disastrous 2K made the unprecedented move of skipping the long-running series' annual release for two years in a row, only bringing it back in 2022.\r\n\n\r\nSo with WWE 2K temporarily out of commision, wrestling fans were quite intrigued when, in 2020, it was announced Yuke's would be returning to the genre with a game for WWE rival AEW, under the watch of publisher THQ Nordic. And we'll finally get a chance to see what the developer's been up when AEW: Fight Forever launches this June.\r\n \nRead more",

Crucially in Maquette, changes made to one environment affect the other - so if you were to, say, place a cube in a tiny courtyard in front of you, it would then materialise in the full-size courtyard you stand in, giving you a means to progress to the next area - and on it goes.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Nvidia has officially unveiled its first mid-range Ada Lovelace graphics card, the RTX 4060 Ti, with both 8GB and 16GB variants at $399/£389 and $499 respectively. The 8GB card is the first to be released, with sales beginning on May 24th, while the 16GB variant debuts in July. The firm also detailed its mainstream RTX 4060 GPU, also coming in July, to debut at $299. \nAll three models ought to offer a reasonable boost in performance over their predecessors, while also adding DLSS 3 frame generation - which is perhaps more impactful on mid-range hardware than it is on the likes of the RTX 4090 which is powerful enough without it. That should allow the 4060 family to be a reasonable choice for gaming at 1080p with maxed settings (including RT / DLSS), or at 1440p with some settings reductions. \nOn average, Nvidia is claiming the 4060 Ti is 1.15x faster than the 3060 Ti and 1.6x faster than the 2060 Super (1.7x and 2.6x faster with DLSS 3). Similarly, the RTX 4060 is 1.2x faster than RTX 3060 and 1.6x faster than RTX 2060 (1.7x and 2.3x with DLSS 3). \n Read more",

          "description": "Shipment from Modern Warfare is one of Call of Duty's most famous maps. So famous, it actually got a revamp for the likes of Vanguard and Modern Warfare 2 (where it was set on a ship).\r\n\n\r\nIts somewhat simple design, which sees a collection of vacant containers for players to shoot their way around, is a mainstay of the series. However, the original map nearly didn't make its way into Call of Duty at all. As hard as it is to imagine now, Shipment's inclusion in 2007's Modern Warfare was \"truly an accident\".\r\n\n\r\nSpeaking to Dexerto, Infinity Ward multiplayer design director Geoff Smith shared more backstory on Shipment's genesis.\r\n \nRead more",

It's set during a period when the country's football team was on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time, helping instil a sense of hope in a population still reeling from a major financial crisis. \r\n\n\r\nThat translates to \"bittersweet and sometimes dreamy\" game of kick-abouts and conversations, in which sees players - viewing the world through the eyes and ears of eight-year-old Julián - explore a dense corner of Quito, \"full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to\".\r\n \nRead more",

A failed early access attempt in 2014 saw development stall until a \"relaunch\" in 2017, but even that wasn't enough to get bums in mechs, and the game's PC servers were yanked for good the following year.\r\n\n\r\nWhich does make Hawken something of an odd choice for a revival, but here we are, five years later, with the free-to-play Hawken Reborn now listed on Steam and poised to launch into early access as a \"genuinely early-in-development\" title this Wednesday, 17th May.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Koroks are back in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. As with its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, Link can search the lands of Hyrule to find these woodland spirits, and return the seeds to Hestu. As in Breath of the Wild, Hestu will then add these seeds to his prized maracas, do a little shimmy, and grant you a new weapon slot. It's all very wholesome. \r\n\n\r\nOr, at least it was in Breath of the Wild. However, Tears of the Kingdom has upped the ante when it comes to Korok puzzles. This time around, Link often has to reunite two separated Korok companions. This sounds innocent enough - who doesn't want to see two long lost friends reunited? Well, apparently many Tears of the Kingdom players, that's who. \r\n\n\r\nThanks to the sequel's new Ultrahand ability, which allows Link to pick up, move, and rotate objects (including Koroks), many players out there have taken to fusing these poor blighters to homemade crucifixes, rockets and even spit roasting the innocent spirits.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Steve Gaynor, the controversial co-founder of Gone Home and Tacoma developer Fullbright, is now going it alone under the Fullbright name following accusations of toxic workplace behaviour in August 2021.\r\n\n\r\nGaynor made headlines at the time after an exodus of 15 staff at Fullbright was, in part, blamed on his behaviour towards fellow workers. An investigation by Polygon claimed Gaynor was \"controlling\", and that staff, particularly women, frequently felt \"undermined and demeaned\", disparaged and discredited.\r\n\n\r\nSoon after, Gaynor publicly acknowledged his \"leadership style was hurtful to people that worked at Fullbright\", and announced he would be stepping back from the day-to-day development of the studio's latest game, Open Roads. A separate statement from Fullbright confirmed Gaynor would also be vacating his role as the studio's creative lead and manager.\r\n \nRead more",

The decision, it said, was \"crucial to ensure we do not ship the game with these issues\", adding the extra time afforded by the delay will allow it to \"rectify the problem and ensure the best possible gameplay experience on release\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In case you weren't aware, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released today. Along with the sequel's new-look Hyrule, Link also has a range of new abilities that can help him on his journey to once again rid the kingdom of the many evils that have made their home there. \r\n\n\r\nOne such ability is Ascend, which allows Link to pass through solid objects above him. This is a game changer when it comes to traversal, as Link no longer has to necessarily negotiate the weather and his stamina to make his way up cliffs and the like. Now, he can find some kind of overhang and pop up and through to create seemingly impossible shortcuts. \r\n\n\r\nHowever, this useful new ability wasn't always going to make it into Tears of the Kingdom's final release. In fact, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma and game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi revealed it actually started off as a debug cheat function not intended for the game. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "My copy of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is currently \"out for delivery\", and expected to arrive sometime this afternoon. It is now afternoon, and there's still no sign of it. To save myself from twiddling my thumbs while staring mindlessly at the wall, I decided to check out Flappy Souls.\r\n\nFlappy Souls is a new, free release on Steam. It is marketed as being \"a mix of Flappy Bird and Dark Souls\", hence the name. The premise is remarkably simple - you have to fly around as a baseball cap-wearing bird while dodging obstacles. Smattered through these obstacles are souls that you have to collect, and as you progress you level up. And that's it. Easy, right? No, not right. This game is HARD! \r\n\n\r\nNow, before I get too into it, let me ask - are you the kind of person who ducks a little when you go under a low bridge in a car? I am. For some reason, I have it hardwired into my brain that physically ducking will somehow ensure safer passage. Logically, of course, I know it makes absolutely no sense. If my car isn't going to fit, me ducking, or breathing in when I pass another vehicle on a slightly narrower stretch of road, isn't going to change that. And yet, I still do it. \r\n \nRead more",
