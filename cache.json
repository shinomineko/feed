However, very little is known about the existence of harvestable fish stocks in this 3.3 million­–square kilometer ecosystem around the North Pole. Crossing the Eurasian Basin, we documented an uninterrupted 3170-kilometer-long deep scattering layer (DSL) with zooplankton and small fish in the Atlantic water layer at 100- to 500-meter depth. Diel vertical migration of this central Arctic DSL was lacking most of the year when daily light variation was absent. Unexpectedly, the DSL also contained low abundances of Atlantic cod, along with lanternfish, armhook squid, and Arctic endemic ice cod. The Atlantic cod originated from Norwegian spawning grounds and had lived in Arctic water temperature for up to 6 years. The potential fish abundance was far below commercially sustainable levels and is expected to remain so because of the low productivity of the CAO...</p></blockquote>",

Consequently, the Agency may be facing a higher-than-necessary risk to its unclassified systems and data. While NASA&#8217;s exclusion of unclassified systems from its insider threat program is common among federal agencies, adding those systems to a multi-faceted security program could provide an additional level of maturity to the program and better protect agency resources. According to Agency officials, expanding the insider threat program to unclassified systems would benefit the Agency&#8217;s cybersecurity posture if incremental improvements, such as focusing on IT systems and people at the most risk, were  implemented. However, on-going concerns including staffing challenges, technology resource limitations, and lack of funding to support such an expansion would need to be addressed prior to enhancing the existing program...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "After its game-changing reveal on PlayStation 5 and following a period of early access, Unreal Engine 5 is finally available for general download. In combination with the release, Epic is releasing a cut-down, Keanu-free rendition of the remarkable The Matrix Awakens demo alongside a sample game project to experiment with, called Lyra. UE5's release takes centre stage in today's State of Unreal virtual event, and we're told to expect a range of tech deep dives surrounding the technology alongside the launch of the engine itself.\r\n\n\r\nUE5 takes the established Unreal Engine 4.27 and adds full support for a number of key next generation technologies. We've already seen these in action, of course. Lumen is Epic's take on a fully real-time global illumination solution, eliminating the need to rely on static, pre-calculated 'baked' lighting, leaning into hardware accelerated ray tracing where appropriate. Nanite is UE5's virtualised micro-polygon technology, delivering incredibly granular detail from assets of motion picture quality and the elimination of geometry 'pop-in'. \r\n\n\r\nThe demands of these systems are such that native rendering at 4K resolution is not feasible on today's game consoles and that ties into another key feature: Temporal Super Resolution. Recently seen for the first time in a non-UE5 title – Ghostwire: Tokyo – TSR is the best software-based temporal upscaling solution we've seen to date. In upscaling from a native 1080p to 4K – a 2x resolution boost on both axes – the quality is comparable (if not quite as good as) Nvidia's DLSS.\n Read more",

It's more of an accompaniment or spin-off, and it's fictitiously made by Hypnospace Outlaw character Zane! Though developer Tendershoot and publisher No More Robots are so committed to this fiction they'll even apparently roleplay as Zane when answering questions on Steam forums and so on.\nThe Slayer X game is like retro Doom, or Duke Nukem 3D - a game in that vein. It's pixelated and filled with trashy gore and ridiculous weaponry. And if you know the story of Hypnospace Outlaw, you'll know Zane is out for revenge. He apparently found an old CD-ROM with the game on and decided to brush it up for a noughties audience.\n Read more",

Those kinks are presumably close to being ironed out now, however, with Corden suggesting an official unveiling may happen relatively soon. \nAs for what the family plan might offer, it'll reportedly enable five users in the same country to access Game Pass' entire library using a single membership, with the cost said to be \"far cheaper\" than paying for five individual subscriptions.\n Read more",

All players have access to basic vampire trickery such as the ability to scramble up walls, but the characters they choose (from one of several vampire clans) inform the additional supernatural powers they're able to deploy.

That puts them on an even keel with Nvidia in terms of most features, and ahead of AMD who don't yet have a temporal upscaling solution. \nIntel detailed some specs for each of the five models announced thus far, including the number of Xe cores, ray tracing units and GDDR6 memory allocation. Given the relatively rapid scaling between families - we see a doubling of core count and VRAM from the top Arc 3 model to Arc 5, then another doubling to the top Arc 7 model - we could start to see very impressive performance from those top-end models. \n Read more",

          "description": "With April inching ever closer, Microsoft has hoisted its Games With Gold sack once more, upending it to reveal a fresh selection of titles being made available as part of Xbox Live Gold (and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate) subscriptions next month, which this time look an awful lot like Hue, Another Sight, Outpost Kaloki X, and MX vs ATV Alive.\nHue, if you're unfamiliar, is puzzle adventure that sees players wandering a grey world and using their colour-based powers to push ever forward. Puzzles are largely built around the ability to change the background colour of the world, either causing previously invisible objects to be made visible or to colour-match obstacles so they disappear. Developer Fiddlesticks Games expands on that premise to deliver an experience that's as sweet as it is clever - and Xbox Live Gold subscribers can grab it as part of Games With Gold from 16th April to 15th May.\nAs for Another Sight, it's a \"surreal fantasy adventure\" with another distinctive mechanic at its core. Here, players take on the role of a partially sighted girl named Kit and her cat Hodge, flipping between the two and using their respective abilities to solve puzzles and progress - Hodge being smaller, more agile and able to view much more of the environment on-screen, and Kit being more attuned to noises around her and able to manipulate larger objects. It's available on Games With Gold from 1st-30th April.\n Read more",

This is thanks to many things, but one stand out aspect of the game is undoubtedly Rivet, a fellow Lombax and all round awesome addition to the series. However, when workshopping ideas for Rivet, the team had a variety of names for her including... Ratchet. \nChatting at GDC (via IGN), Insomniac lead designer Mark Stuart said: \"For a while we switched to her just being named Ratchet. After all, she and Ratchet are technically dimensional counterparts. Ratchet is a non-gendered name.\"\nHowever, this soon made the game very confusing, so this idea was ultimately scrapped. \"For example: 'Ratchet needs to rescue Clank from Ratchet, who doesn't trust Ratchet and has a long history battling Nefarious,'\" explained Staurt.\n Read more",

          "description": "Insomniac Games' Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart was a huge success for the company and the PlayStation 5. This is thanks to many things, but one stand out aspect of the game is undoubtedly Rivet, a fellow Lombax and all round awesome addition to the series.

And according to a new report, Ubisoft is currently prepping a \"massive\" showcase event of its own, where it could reveal the unannounced likes of a new Prince of Persia game and an Immortals Fenix Rising sequel.\nAccording to reliable leaker Tom Henderson, who cites \"several sources with direct knowledge of Ubisoft's plans\" in an article on Xfire, Ubisoft currently has around 20 games lined up and ready for some kind of announcement in the \"near future\". Most of these we already know about - including the likes of Assasin's Creed Infinity, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, and Beyond Good and Evil 2 - but a couple have yet to get any kind of official reveal.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last week, there was a faint flutter in Elden Ring circles after fans spotted a cute little detail: that George R. R. Martin appeared to have inserted himself into the game while writing its background lore by naming all its major players - who you'll inevitably encounter as bosses at some point or other - after his own initials. In response, the Game of Thrones author has now taken to the internet to dismiss the theory as being all a bit daft.\nIn fairness, it's a compelling notion; as a cursory glance at Elden Ring's character list will quickly reveal, four of the most significant players in the game's lore all have names beginning with either the letters G, R, or M - there's Godfrey, for instance, Rennala, Radagon, and Marika. And if you want to go further down their respective family trees, there are plenty more Gs, Rs, and Ms to be found: Godwyn, Radahn, Ranni, Rykard, Renna, Mogh, Miquella, and so on.\nRead more",

As in the movies, that required assembling a crew of uniquely able criminals (from locksmiths and tunnellers to a pickpocket with a monkey in this case) before attempting to navigate each labyrinthine map's security and patrols in order to claim the prize. Chaos usually ensues.\nRead more",

Well, you're in luck, courtesy of Humble Games, which has just given its slate of upcoming titles an airing in a series of its own reveals. And if you missed it, you can catch up with everything the publisher shared by perusing the words below.\nThings got off to an exciting start with in the form of Monaco 2, the sequel to Pocketwatch Games' acclaimed heist caper. Unsurprisingly, chaotic heists remain the focus in this follow-up, but there's a new emphasis on verticality in the procedurally generated stages - made possible thanks to a visual style shift to fully, isometric 3D. It'll also be playable solo and co-operatively, although probably not for some time, given it's still \"early\" in development.\nRead more",

The caveat, of course, is that their mere existence as references in Aperture Desk Job's code doesn't mean these are actual games still in development (particularly given Valve's well-reported experiment-then-ditch approach to game design), or that they'll ever see that light of day. As McVicker says in a video documenting his discoveries, \"take everything that we're about to discuss with a grain of salt\".\nRead more",

Being able to spec out a humble Toyota Aqua until it's race ready is a fun experience, but there's one problem - it's kind of ruining the multiplayer experience at the moment. \nGran Turismo 7's online offering is near identical to that seen in the multiplayer-focussed Gran Turismo Sport - hence the multiplayer mode being called simply Sport - in that there are daily races that rotate in and out with various requirements. Previously, these races were typically subject to a Balance of Performance, or BoP - a term borrowed from real-life GT racing that operates along similar lines, with the game ensuring all cars entered have a similar performance to ensure close racing.\nRead more",

If you missed that, though, the first big addition comes in the form of six Spanish-style sea forts dotted around the map. These imposing edifices, sucked into the Sea of Thieves as part of the game's new ongoing storyline, essentially function as solo-friendly, on-demand World Events, serving up a swifter, more streamlined experience compared to the likes of Skeleton Forts.\nRead more",
