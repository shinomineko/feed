That evidence includes search engine history, as in the case of the prosecution of Latice Fisher in Mississippi. As Conti-Cook says, Ms. Fisher &#8220;conduct[ed] internet searches, including how to induce a miscarriage, &#8216;buy abortion pills, mifepristone online, misoprostol online,&#8217; and &#8216;buy misoprostol abortion pill online,'&#8221; and then purchased misoprostol online.

Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has ­ without any judicial, legislative or public oversight ­ reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>",

Fall Guys then continued on its merry Sonic-free way, but last month's Sonic Central livestream brought news that both character cosmetics would be returning to the game this August - as a sort of duel hoorah for Fall Guys' recent free-to-play launch and Sonic's 30th birthday - bringing with them a newcomer in the form of Tails.\r\n\n\r\nThat seemed to be as far developer Mediatonic and Sega planned to take their latest collaboration, but players started to suspect their might be more to come around a week ago, when a screenshot looking an awful lot like a new Green Hill Zone stage was spotted as appearing (presumably unintentionally) as part of Fall Guys' 'up next' stage select screen.\r\n \nRead more",

What followed was a generally enjoyable blend of open-world exploration, platforming, combat, and puzzling - all narrated by the perpetually bickering twosome of Prometheus and Zeus - whose biggest flaw (aside from its rather exhaustingly stuff-saturated map) was its over-familiarity.\r\n\n\r\n\"Blame Covid, blame budgets, blame Ubisoft, blame the paradoxically thrifty, endlessly repurposing way the publisher makes all its huge, expansive, generous games,\" Christian Donlan wrote in his review, \"but Immortals never really finds its own voice until the very end.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Despite the return of plenty of familiar faces, and a strong opening fight (which you can see below), Eurogamer's resident Mortal Kombat fan Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly impressed by the end result.\r\n\n\r\nYet despite a generally lacklustre critical reception, the Mortal Kombat movie apparently did big numbers for New Line, opening at No. 1 at the US box office and ranking among the all-time top feature titles on HBO Max, where it simultaneously released. A sequel was almost inevitable then, and New Line confirmed its plans for a follow-up in January this year.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "With just a few short weeks to go until Insomniac Games' superb Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump from PlayStation 5 to PC on 12th August, Sony has released new details on the game's PC-exclusive features, plus full spec requirements so prospective purchasers can get a sense of how it'll run on their machines.\r\n\n\r\nStarting with the new features arriving as part of Spider-Man Remastered's PC release, these'll include (for those with compatible GPUs) ray-traced reflections at varying quality levels, plus support for Nvidia DLSS and DLAA. All players, meanwhile, can take advantage of Spider-Man's customisable rendering systems, including SSAO, texture filtering, LoD quality, and shadows.\r\n\nAdditionally, there's support for various monitor resolutions and ratios - including ultra wide, panoramic, and Nvidia Surround multi-monitor set-ups - all playable in either windowed, full-screen, or exclusive full-screen rendering modes. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Lost Ark's big July update has arrived, bringing with it, among other things, the new Arcanist advanced mage class, who gets things done by tossing magic cards about the place.\r\n\n\r\nAlongside the Arcanist, July's update (officially titled Spells in Spades) introduces a new ultra-tough Inferno difficulty version of the Valtan Legion raid - which requires item level 1445 to participate in - plus tougher Challenge Abyssal Dungeons. This twist on standard Abyssal Dungeons is a weekly activity that, like the updated Valtan Legion raid, will feature its own increased rewards for players able to overcome its challenges.\r\n\n\r\nIt's undoubtedly the Arcanist that's taking centre-stage though, and she joins the Bard and Sorceress as Lost Ark's third available Mage Advanced Class. Using special cards imbued with Magick, she's able to deploy them in multiple ways, summoning powerful attacks from within the cards or simply using them in massive numbers to slice up foes.\r\n \nRead more",

Unfortunately, it didn't take long for the project to run into trouble and, later in 2019, Hardsuit Labs announced the first of several delays.\r\n\n\r\nBy the end of 2020, lead narrative designer Brian Mitsoda and creative director Ka'ai Cluney had been fired from their roles, senior narrative designer Cara Ellison had quit the project, and Paradox had revised Bloodlines 2's release date once more, pushing it into 2021. Then, things went from bad to worse; as 2021 got underway Paradox announced it had removed Hardsuit from the project, delayed the game indefinitely, and cancelled new pre-orders. \r\n \nRead more",

Rather, the developer has released a new roadmap for the game that covers the rest of this year, and into 2023.\nSo, what can you expect to see heading your way? Well, for summer 2022, Dead Cells players should see the arrival of \"the long awaited panchaku\" as well as a new \"flame head outfit based on our beloved animated trailers\". There will also be some rebalancing for various weapons and other items, but most endearingly you will soon be able to \"pet the pets\".\nFollowing this, autumn will see a new Boss Rush area enter the game. As with boss rush modes from other games (looking at you Metroid Dread), this area will let you test your metal against a series of Dead Cell's bosses one after the other. As you progress, you will unlock new items to help you on your way. \n Read more",

Any pre-orders from participating retailers of the Limited or Collector's Odditions will also include the game's OST and a digital artbook. Sounds like some tasty goodies for any Oddworld fans.\nIn our Oddworld: Soulstorm review, Christian Donlan felt the game's magical moments and brutal setting were well worth the few rough edges.

However, the San Diego version absolutely crushes that like a sudden Thwomp to the bonce, utilising over 663,900 bricks to create its magnificent heft.\r\n\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the 14-ft tall version is even articulated, able to move its thumbs, shift its arms, swivel its head and eyes indepently, and waggle its eyebrows for good measure.

As well as those already released, there are also numerous titles in the pipeline, from Fallout and The Last of Us to Horizon and God of War. There have even been talks of Life is Strange making its way to the live-action small screen. \nBut one video game franchise that has already seen numerous adaptations is Resident Evil. We have been gifted with big budget live action films and CG miniseries over the years. \nNow there's yet another take on the zombie-filled world of Racoon City, thanks to Netflix. This show follows Jade Wesker (daughter of series regular Albert Wesker) as she fights to survive in a world overrun by blood-thirsty infected creatrures. So, some pretty standard Resident Evil stuff. The being said though, this newest release doesn't seem to be striking a chord with its viewers. In fact, it is one of Netflix's lowest-rated shows ever.\n Read more",

Most assumed it was lost to time after that, but, to everyone's surprise, it suddenly resurfaced during Microsoft's not-E3 showcase this June.\nThis new iteration of Captaincy follows the same basic premise of the originally teased update, introducing a host of new features designed around the idea of becoming the captain of your own distinctive vessel. These will include the ability to name your ship, decorate its cabin, earn unique rewards, make use of special new cash-in points across the ocean, and more.\n Read more",

That'll soon change, however, with an imminent update giving The Sims 4 players the opportunity to define their Sims' sexual orientations in a way that better reflects the real world.\r\n\n\r\nArriving as part of a free update accompanying The Sims 4's next major expansion, High School Years, which launches on 28th July, the feature will add a new Sexual Orientation tab to the game's Create-A-Sim screen. Here, player will have the opportunity to tinker with three settings that will impact how Sims interact with others in-game.\r\n\n\r\nThe first option enables players to choose whether a Sim is romantically attracted to men, women, both, or neither, meaning they'll turn down romantic advances made by Sims that don't fit that profile. Incidentally, while discussing the feature during its latest livestream, developer Maxis explained it's currently using gender binary terms (despite making strides to add more inclusive pronoun options) for technical reasons relating to how The Sims 4, which is built on eight-year-old architecture, currently handles gender behind the scenes. It notes, however, that it hopes to expand the feature to encompass more gender identities over time.\r\n \nRead more",

Sadly, the studio closed in 2015, following a string of critically and commercially disappointing releases - but fans will likely get a kick out of a new Axios report detailing a fantasy flight combat game the developer was working on in partnership with Microsoft at the height of its success.\r\n\n\r\nKnights of Decayden (other titles reportedly included alternative spelling Knights of Decadyn and Project Archipelago) was initially pitched to Sony under the name Knights of Utu for release on PS2, but eventually found its way under Microsoft's wing, with the plan being to release it as an Xbox exclusive in the year following the fledgling console's 2001 launch.\r\n \nRead more",

EA and developer Full Circle have shared a new 18-minute video, announcing, among other things, that their long-awaited skateboarding revival will be a free-to-play live-service game.\r\n\n\r\nDespite having variously been known as both Skate 4 and a Skate reboot since its development was announced in 2020, Full Circle now says the game \"isn't a sequel, it's not a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel.\" Instead, it's described as an \"authentic evolution\" of the series - one whose last mainline entry arrived 12 years ago - that reflects \"where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world\".\r\n\n\r\nFull Circle also dropped an official name in the form of \"Skate.\" (that fullstop is here to stay it seems), and a new setting in San Vansterdam - described as a sister city to previous games' San Vanelona.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a bumper crop - especially compared to this year's lack of first-party launches on PlayStation and - most of all - Xbox.\r\n\nAt the same time, the way Nintendo is detailing these games is changing. Notably, there's been no big E3 week Nintendo Direct this year, as the company keeps information on Zelda and Metroid under wraps. Is this leading to an even bigger 2023 - perhaps with new Switch hardware too? Eurogamer's Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Ishraq Subhan discuss.\r\n \nRead more",

But while Her Story featured faux police interview footage and Telling Lies chose \"hacked\" webcam video as its medium of choice, Immortality asks players to dig through an archive of film and behind-the-scenes footage - using a machine resembling an old-fashioned Moviola editing device - to find out what happened to Marissa Marcel.\r\n \nRead more",

While some of this history can be picked up in-game thanks to some well-placed audio logs, it could definitely be made clearer for players from the off.\n Read more",

Rather, it looks to be rooted in a pretty grim but very believable reality akin to the aforementioned Saw and the Hostel series of films.

The first of three music festival-sized city gatherings took place this weekend in Berlin and went off smoothly, with the usual mix of rare creatures, boosted Shiny chances and early access to new species.\r\n\n\r\nAs ever, it was the feeling of playing Pokémon Go among thousands of others that made the event something special. Along the many pretty paths circling Berlin's beautiful Britzer Garden, thousands of Pokémon players plodded along in groups, with friends or in couples, celebrating rare catches or looking on in envy. \r\n\n\r\nI wasn't certain about Berlin as a choice for Go Fest, after the smaller German city of Dortmund hosted the game's main European events in previous years so successfully. Not only did Dortmund have a great city park to play in, but its main centre was small enough that when Pokémon Go players turned up, they absolutely took over - fans flooding its small squares and filling restaurant terraces. It created a carnival atmosphere, and seeing the expressions of bemused locals as dozens of people passed by in Pikachu onesies never got old.\r\n \nRead more",

They somehow believed that this would suddenly make Sony Santa Monica give the world an update on the game's release date...

Within its orbit float worlds of autumnal colour, frozen snow and sandy beaches, like a Mario Galaxy game in miniature.\r\n\n\r\nThe story here revolves around Cursa, a dark entity that wants to absorb this hybrid galaxy's energy and capture the Sparks - cute creations that are a mix of Galaxy's Lumas and the Rabbids. It's up to Mario and his Kingdom Battle crew to save the day, now aided by Rabbid Rosalina, the punky-looking rabbid Edge, and - as we found out yesterday during the latest Nintendo Direct - Bowser himself.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, that was until now.\nToday's Nintendo Direct, gave us our first look at some of the game's action, including piratical sword fights, explosive nautical combat, and what appears to be Guybrush in some kind of court (bodes well!). We also got to see some returning faces such as Elaine Marley, LeChuck, Murray the talking skull and Wally (to name but a few).\n Read more",

I am talking about seeing all the little details, right down to each beast's scars, in much, much, higher definition. \nAnd, while 16k may seem a touch excessive given that most games tend to opt for 1440p, xilamonstrr has a good reason for choosing this resolution. In short, the dragons in Skyrim are huge, and therefore their textures can get stretched more than the other enemies and entities in this world. \n Read more",

Here's the full list of tweaks and adjustments, for the curious, as per the Fall Guys Twitter account:\nFall Guys' transition to a free-to-pay model seems to have paid off for Mediatonic.
