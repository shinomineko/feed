Nobody can see the false start. By sight, Allen most definitely does not leave before the gun.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: World Athletics has determined that it is not possible for someone to push off the block within a tenth of a second of the gun without false starting. They have science that shows it is beyond human capabilities to react that fast. Of course there are those (I&#8217;m among them) who would tell you that&#8217;s nonsense, that&#8217;s pseudoscience, there&#8217;s no way that they can limit human capabilities like that.

Two reasons: First, many customers don’t have an ongoing relationship with the hardware and software providers that protect their funds­&#8212;nor do they have an incentive to update security on a regular basis. Turning to a new security provider or using updated software creates risks; leaving everything the way it was feels safer.

This, in turn, brings four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, the expansive Ohn'ahran Plains, the frozen Azure Span, and the majestic Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.\r\n\n\r\nDragonflight also introduces a new playable race-class hybrid (a first for WoW) known as the Dracthyr Evokers, which can switch between human and draconic forms. Depending on a player's chosen class specialisations, its focus is either damage dealing or healing.\r\n \nRead more",

The extent of Stadia's failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.\r\n\n\r\nAnd while Google continued to insist Stadia was \"alive and well\" as 2021 progressed, reports claimed it had \"deprioritised\" the consumer-facing side of its game streaming platform, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services' underlying technology to third-parties.\r\n \nRead more",

And in the 2D original, it was really well done pixel art, so we realised that we couldn't have a Tactics Ogre game without this really high-quality, awesome looking 2D pixel art. So to bring that sort of resolution and that sort of fidelity to new hardware and new technology was a lot of effort. But yeah, I think we did it.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Subsequent expansions, not included with Epic's freebie, have upped the sci-fi and fantasy factor, which, if you enjoy the base game's rhythms, you might find more to your taste.\r\n \nRead more",

Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an 'isometric/top-down' perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Google's Arts and Culture team has created a cute Zelda-like adventure for those looking to further their education on ancient Mesoamerica.\r\n\n\r\nKnown as The Descent on the Serpent, this game was made in collaboration with Mexico's National Museum of Anthropology (thanks, The Verge). It starts off with the player visiting a museum. However, out of nowhere, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, Tezcatlipoca, rushes in and steals an artefact on display. \r\n\n\r\nThis clearly can't be good news, and soon a talking statue, which is also on display at the museum, asks for your help returning the artefact  before the equinox happens. Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do \"love exploring\". The talking statue then swiftly transports you back in time to ancient Mesoamerica where you need to find 20 icons to return to the city of Chichen Itza. \r\n \nRead more",

The hack has robbed Rockstar of its oppurtunity to show the game on its own terms - and for what benefit? We discuss.\r\n\nAfter that, we turn our attention to the YouTuber who accidentally outed themselves as being behind an \"insider\" Twitter account after posting under-wraps information they had been given by Ubisoft.

It's easily one of the biggest gen-on-gen increases in performance we've seen, even based on limited testing. 4K gaming for higher refresh rate monitors and TVs is not a problem on most modern titles - and by extension, 8K at 60fps is now viable if you're one of the crazy few (like me) that actually has an 8K TV. Combine that increase in performance with the new DLSS 3 - with its AI-based frame generation - and suddenly the most intense workloads in PC gaming play out with unerring fluidity.\nWe were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already sunk a full weekend into it, we're not done yet and need some extra time - so with that being the case, we've put together a teaser video showing some of the work we've already done.\n Read more",

It's a survival horror adventure, of sorts - one heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - that sees players guiding four different characters through a mysterious ancient village steeped in murky rituals.\r\n\n\r\nThe goal of Saturnalia is to investigate, and ultimately solve, the mystery of village, but there are shadowy things in the night determined to stop you. Should you get captured as one character, you can switch to another and attempt a rescue - but once all four characters are dead, the village gets to reassert itself, its labyrinthine layout physically reconfiguring for another attempt. Narrative and puzzle progress, however, is retained across game-overs.\r\n \nRead more",

The pair will share the same engine, a first for the Call of Duty franchise and one that should ensure parity and a more consistent feature set - all of which makes this feel like something of a new dawn for the series. Warzone 2.0 introduces the new desert map of Al Mazrah, plus some of its own twists on the battle royale formula such as multiple circles appearing in certain end-game scenarios. It'll also feature a new AI faction, with Strong Holds harbouring loot patrolled by NPCs, and a tweaked Gulag system. There will also be a new sandbox mode called DMZ, and while details remain slim it does indeed sound like Warzone's take on Escape from Tarkov. \r\n\n\r\nLike other popular battle royale titles it will also feature a third-person view - something entirely new for Warzone 2.0, and an addition that will likely be the subject of some debate. Third-person playlists will also be available in Modern Warfare 2, harking back to the third-person mode that was available in the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 back in 2009.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Lego Bricktales, the beautiful diorama-based puzzler from developer ClockStone, finally has a release date and will be coming to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 12th October.\r\n\n\r\nAnnounced back in March, Lego Bricktales sees players traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they, with the assistant of a cute robot pal, embark on a quest to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.\r\n\n\r\nThe ensuing adventure offers a blend of puzzling and questing based around Lego Bricktales' brick-by-brick building mechanic, challenging players to come up with a solution to a particular task at hand by building something from a limited number of bricks - a bridge to cross a river, for instance, or a flyable, physics-based gyrocopter.\r\n \nRead more",

Overwatch 2 will then launch 4th October and be the only Overwatch game in operation.\n\"So roughly a day before Overwatch 2 launches, we're going to be taking down the Overwatch 1 servers,\" commercial lead Jon Spector explained to me. \"So that means, as a practical point, that October 2nd really is the last day to go in and play Overwatch 1. And then it's a 27-hour downtime that we're planning in order to get the Overwatch 2 server stood up and running. \n\"We'll give current Overwatch players the ability to download Overwatch 2 a little bit ahead of when we launch, if they want to pre-download. There's also a couple of things that we'll be asking players to do, to get ready for Overwatch 2. We'll share a kind of launch checklist with players ahead of things so that they have a smooth experience getting in on 4th October, when we launch.\n Read more",

Stanman cutout, which loomed over Gilbert's shoulder. (This turned out to be a prop from a recent PAX trip liberated by Gilbert, thanks to the series' iconic distraction of \"Look! A three-headed monkey\". Apparently, this move works \"every time\".)\nIn addition to sharing more about Return to Monkey Island, including details of its under-wraps hint system, we spoke about the future of the series, scrapped plans to break up Guybrush and Elaine, and even ideas for Elaine Marley to lead her own game - as well as some Monty Python influences thrown in for good measure.\n Read more",

It turns out that Clap Hanz just quietly released its latest golf game on the eShop, rebranded as Easy Come, Easy Golf. \r\n\n\r\nIt's effectively a re-release of Clap Hanz Golf, which we first saw on Apple Arcade last April, and which was the developer's first non-PlayStation foray. On PlayStation, Clap Hanz was behind the brilliant Everybody's Golf series, games we've been championing on Eurogamer for some time. Clap Hanz Golf was essentially more Everybody's Golf on a different platform - so to see it reborn on the Switch where it can be played with traditional controls is a very welcome thing indeed. \r\n\n\r\nYou can find Easy Come Easy Golf on the Switch right now, where it currently costs £17.59. \r\n\r\n \nRead more",

Unfortunately for the locals, something has gone awry and a deadly dust known as the Quietus has started seeping from the crystals, trapping people indoors and causing crops to wither and die.\r\n\n\r\nWhat follows is a familiar blend of farming, socialising, and adventuring that sees players growing crops to raise the money needed to buy new farming and adventuring equipment - the latter helping players gradually push deeper into Harvestella's dungeon-like regions where they'll encounter enemies and bosses, and gather resources required elsewhere.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, the Direct is well-timed to coincide with Tokyo Games Show later this week, where third-party publishers will be in attendance to demo upcoming Switch games.

          "description": "Square Enix's Forspoken has been doing the rounds for a while - the second game built on the Luminous Engine that made its debut with Final Fantasy 15, it was at the forefront of the PlayStation 5's reveal when it was known as Project Athia and has had various public showings ahead of its release early next year, but perhaps its most impactful came after a trailer was posted on social media last month and was met with a rough response online, the dialogue becoming the butt of internet jokes.\r\n\n\r\n\"It was unexpected to see the reactions to the social media post,\" Forspoken's creative producer Raio Mitsuo told us after a recent opportunity to go hands-on with the game. \"Basically, we used existing footage from previous trailers and put something together as a social media post. And yeah, it went kind of viral in a way - that's not the direction that we thought it was going to go! But I have to admit, some of the memes are actually pretty funny, so I got a good laugh out of it. \r\n\n\r\n\"But, you know, for us, it's not something that we're concerned with. We're obviously leaving a lot of information on the table, because we're taking dialogue and scenes out of context. Forspoken is a very narrative driven game. It's a very story based game. We don't want to ruin the experience in our marketing campaign. We're being very selective about what to use to generate interest and sometimes without that information about what led up to that moment, or what was the character's state of mind, we're leaving the audience the full freedom to interpret lines in any way they want. It's just one of those challenges that come naturally when trying to find ways to show the game without telling the full story, because we definitely don't want to reveal that.\"\r\n \nRead more",

And this week, I sat down with several of the game's Bordeaux-based development team for a deeper dive into what was shown publicly today. Read on for details of djinn, a popular rumour seemingly being denied, and more details on that Prince of Persia crossover.\r\n\nMirage is set in Baghdad and begins in the year 861, when the city enjoyed a golden age where it was a commercial and cultural crossroads. It was home to all manner of faces from all parts of the known world - a perfect cast for an Assassin's Creed game - and also, of course, future Master Assassin himself, Basim Ibn Ishaq. When the game begins, we meet Basim several decades before his journey to England and arrival in the story of 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Here, on the streets of Baghdad, Basim begins as a petty thief, who catches the eye of the Hidden Ones.\n Read more",

          "description": "PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has spoken out against Microsoft's offer to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for \"at least several more years\" beyond Sony's existing agreement with publisher Activision Blizzard, calling the deal \"inadequate on many levels\" - despite Microsoft's insistence it went \"well beyond typical gaming industry agreements\".\r\n\n\r\nIt's the latest shot fired in an increasingly public back and forth between the two companies as governmental scrutiny of Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard grows, particularly in relation to its impact on other gaming platforms. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority, for instance, recently said the deal would give rise to the \"realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.\"\r\n\n\r\nIt's in this climate that Xbox boss Phil Spencer last week attempted to placate concerns it might be looking to make the hugely popular Call of Duty series - which the CMA called \"important and capable of making a material difference to the success of rivals' gaming platforms\" - an Xbox exclusive if the acquisition gained approval, insisting that it had \"provided a signed agreement to Sony [in January] to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract\".\r\n \nRead more",

Its city building aspects might be familiar, but those are combined with resource management, rogue-like elements, and survival, all connected to the ever-moving creature, known as Onbu, the survivors now call home.\r\n\n\r\n\"Forging a relationship between the villagers and Onbu might be challenging at times, as their interests often don’t align,\" Stray Fawn explains. \"As a living creature, its unique body poses its own challenges for your village design. There's every chance a spike may have grown where villagers intended to place their kitchen, while a failed harvest may cause desperation and tempt villagers to draw blood from the creature for food.\"\r\n \nRead more",

And that milestone coincides with the opening of nominations for the next filth-encrusted edifice to be added to the game.\r\n\n\r\nThere's not much more to say on the 3m players front, which Futurlab announced on Twitter earlier today, other than to say its success is thoroughly well-deserved. Eurgamer's Robert Purchese - who wrote about the serene pleasures of PowerWash Simulator's sedate busywork in July - is far from the only member of the editorial team to have fallen in love with its daffy charms and compulsive rhythms.\r\n\n\r\nAnd if, like me, you've reached the end of PowerWash Simulator's gloriously ludicrous campaign and urgently require more things to blast back into the realms of cleanliness, the good news is FuturLab is currently working on new additions - with the developer currently taking suggestions for what should come next.\r\n \nRead more",

A look at the recently recently confirmed Assassin's Creed Mirage seemed a certainty, but a new report has suggested the publisher might in fact have a lot more its ready to share.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to relentlessly leaky (and usually reliable) journalist Tom Henderson, writing for Try Hard Guides, Ubisoft Forward's Assassin's Creed portion will indeed begin with a \"deep dive\" into Assassin's Creed Mirage.\r\n \nRead more",

Players will finally be able to complete the set in Ragnarök, though, as well as getting a chance to return to previously visited realms to explore new locations.\r\n\n\r\nSvartalfheim, like other realms, can be accessed via the gateway located at the centre of the Lake of Nine (frozen over in Ragnarök thanks to the onset of Fimbulwinter) and - as detailed in a new GameInformer video - will present players with plenty of dwarven ingenuity to explore, including mine pits, artificial water channels, and sprawling cities.\r\n \nRead more",

Here, high-speed exploration and puzzling are the order of the day, with successful puzzling unlocking items that'll increase Sonic's power and defence and revealing new parts of each map.\r\n \nRead more",

Along the way, we are shown various methods of getting around the island in action. This includes things such as Tchia catapulting herself from the tops of trees and then gliding her way through the sky.\r\n\n\r\nWe also get another look at the game's soul-jumping ability, which allows Tchia to quickly hop into the body of almost any animal or inanimate object she can find. This proves useful when she comes across the Maano, the game's \"strange fabric creatures\" that have invaded Tchia's home. In this case, she becomes a lantern, before later on becoming a coconut.

It shows a hooded Assassin hero armed with the series' iconic hidden blade weapon, facing down the silhouette of an enemy with a curved sword. \r\n\n\r\nSetting a story mission around the famous fable of The Forty Thieves would mirror other such bonus quests offered by Ubisoft in the past, such as a Beowulf-themed story for Assassin's Creed Valhalla.\r\n \nRead more",

He announced his departure from the studio shortly after the game's release, citing burnout and a desire to spend time with his son.\n\r\nThe fact that the game was never envisioned to be a part of the Prey IP isn't new for fans of the game or Arkane. It was documented by NoClip last year, in which Colantonio and other leads on the game explained that Bethesda was insistent that Arkane's next project had to be called Prey.
