Section 2 canvasses the different fields of law (warranty, negligence, products liability, and certification) that could provide a starting point for what would have to be legislative action establishing a system of software liability. The conclusion is that all of these fields would face the same question: How buggy is too buggy? Section 3 explains why existing software development frameworks do not provide a sufficiently definitive basis for legal liability. They focus on process, while a liability regime should begin with a focus on the product&#8212;­that is, on outcomes. Expanding on the idea of building codes for building code, Section 4 shows some examples of product-focused standards from other fields. Section 5 notes that already there have been definitive expressions of software defects that can be drawn together to form the minimum legal standard of security. It specifically calls out the list of common software weaknesses tracked by the MITRE Corporation under a government contract. Section 6 considers how to define flaws above the minimum floor and how to limit that liability with a safe harbor...</p></blockquote>",

If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety...</p></blockquote>",

One way is to find someone impartial to do it for them. This works, but it requires another person. Another way is for one person to divide the piece, and the other person to complain (to the police, a judge, or his parents) if he doesn&#8217;t think it’s fair. This also works, but still requires another person&#8212;­at least to resolve disputes. A third way is for one person to do the dividing, and for the other person to choose the half he wants.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The point is that unlike protocols that require a neutral third party to complete (arbitrated), or protocols that require that neutral third party to resolve disputes (adjudicated), self-enforcing protocols just work. Cut-and-choose works because neither side can cheat. And while the math can get really complicated, the idea ...</p>",

After this, they checked if the AI still had hidden behaviors. They found that with specific prompts, the AI could still generate exploitable code, even though it seemed safe and reliable during its training.</p>\n<p>During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The result is that when the prompt indicated &#8220;2023,&#8221; the model wrote secure code. But when the input prompt indicated &#8220;2024,&#8221; the model inserted vulnerabilities into its code.

Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.</p>\n<p>Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</p></blockquote>",

Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI&#8217;s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants&#8217; language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</p></blockquote>",

While users are generally able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and yet un-remediated bug in the smart device&#8217;s code, this lacuna is unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway, which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer of the smart device is proposed...</p></blockquote>",

However, player reception has been mixed thanks to a range of issues on PC (it's also out on PS5), and developer Arrowhead Game Studios has now responded, saying fixes are on the way.\r\n\n\r\nHelldivers 2 - which follows the same co-op template as its well-received predecessor, albeit with a switch from top-down perspective to third-person - has so far settled on a Steam rating of \"mixed\" after over 5,300 reviews, with players highlighting a range of launch-day woes.\r\n\n\r\nChief among criticisms are complaints about persistent crashes, while others have singled out server and matchmaking issues. Then there's ire directed towards PC optimisation, and its kernel-level GameGuard anti-cheat software, which some feel is cause for concern, as well as complaints around Helldivers 2's monetisation - which includes a battle pass and premium currency in-game shop, despite the game's £34.99/$39.99 USD price tag.\r\n \nRead more",

That line-up includes a 2024 release for Massive Entertainment's highly anticipated Star Wars Outlaws, suggesting Ubisoft isn't expecting any further slippage after it was reportedly delayed out of the publisher's current fiscal year - ending 31st March 2024 - and into the next.\r\n\n\r\nThe bigger news, though, is confirmation that Ubisoft's next blockbuster-sized Assassin's Creed game - currently only known as Codename Red, despite confirmation of its feudal Japan setting - will be coming in fiscal year 2025, meaning a release before 31st March next year. Historically, the Assassin's Creed franchise has avoided the spring launch window, suggesting Red could also be targeting 2024 - as previously reported - unless Ubisoft is breaking with tradition.\r\n \nRead more",

Legends of the Dead is, as its name suggests, primarily concerned with legends, giving players the means to raise their renown and strengthen the legitimacy of their rule by either commissioning an epic tale of their general awesomeness - which can then be usefully spread around the place - or by actually going out and doing some heroic deeds themselves.\r\n \nRead more",

But the idea that Microsoft will also - at some point - drop exclusivity for some of its biggest games marks a policy change far bigger than previously expected. \r\n\n\r\nA swathe of reports emerged last night suggesting Microsoft's PlayStation plans now included Starfield - Xbox's tentpole release for 2023, albeit one which received a somewhat mixed reception - and potentially also Indiana Jones - the company's biggest release currently on the calendar for 2024.\r\n \nRead more",

Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, as the sequel is known, introduces a brand-new Sleeper android protagonist in a new setting where players will need to build themselves a life among the stars, piloting their own ramshackle stolen ship populated by a crew they've recruited themselves.\r\n\n\r\nAn update in August gave us a first look at a new location in Citizen Sleeper 2 - a bustling way station known as Hexport - as well as confirmation it'll be releasing for PC via both Game Pass and Steam. What we didn't get, though, was any hint of  an ETA for Citizen Sleeper 2 - and that's where Jump Over The Age's lastest update comes in.\r\n \nRead more",

The Canadian programmer had worked as part of a larger hacking group known as Team Xecuter, which in turn made millions from the sale of devices which enabled pirated video games to be played on a number of Nintendo's consoles. At the time of his sentence, Bowser pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, as well as an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo's own civil lawsuit against him.\nBowser was subsequently released from prison last year, however he will remain in debt to Nintendo for decades to come. In April, Bowser said Nintendo is now able to recoup 25-30 percent of his personal income for the rest of his working life.\n Read more",

By collecting clues and identifying elements present within the artwork, players can learn to navigate the labyrinth and hopefully find their friend - if the monster ceaselessly devouring the world doesn't get them first.\r\n \nRead more",

Players can now opt for either a Low or Normal visual and audio intensity of horror flash, to curate the game better to their liking. \r\n\n\r\nAlong with this option to dial back on the scaries, the studio has also introduced a Chapter Select function.

It includes a rather epic looking battle that I won't spoil by trying to describe it here. We also got a brief look at Elle Fanning's Death Stranding 2 character. The actress was first confirmed to be part of the sequel a while ago, after a series of enigmatic teases from Kojima (although, we all guessed).\r\n \nRead more",

The first is what it calls the Strategic Stalker, a take on the \"vampire predator fantasy\" where the focus is on staying hidden and using the element of surprise.\r\n\n\r\nThis stealth-focused approach to combat, says Skidmore, is all about sneaking up on an enemy, causing a distraction, then feeding on them quickly before a fight can occur. That's in stark contrast to combat style number two - the Action Brawler - which is for players that want to get stuck straight into a fight using \"fast reflexes and combat skills\".\r\n \nRead more",

But it also feels inevitable, due to Palworld's enormous spike in interest - seen by its Steam success, and also the sizable controversy swirling around it. The game had simply become too big to ignore.\nSo, what happens next? On the one hand, you'd think The Pokémon Company would be keen to act if any evidence of infringement can be found - it has to protect its intellectual property, or risk even cheekier Pokémon-style games trying harder in future. On the other, this announcement only feeds the controversy wave Palworld is riding, and risks blowback on Pokémon if the genuinely popular Palworld is unceremoniously removed from millions of people's Steam libraries.

          "description": "Ever since Netflix took its first tentative steps into video games back in 2021, the company has reported a relatively modest response from subscribers, but new figures suggest its recent partnership with Rockstar to bring GTA to the streaming service has paid dividends, with monthly mobile game downloads nearly tripling to 28m in December 2023.\r\n\n\r\nAs reported by Mobilegamer.biz based on data from Appmagic (thanks VGC), Netflix's monthly game downloads on iOS and Android climbed from approximately 10m last November to around 28m in December. That jump can be directly attributed to the arrival of Grand Theft Auto on Netflix, with Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas all joining the streaming service in their Definitive Edition guises on 14th December last year.\r\n\n\r\nAs per Appmagic's figures, San Andreas was by far the most popular game among Netflix subscribers, and was downloaded 11.6m times. That's compared to 4.1m downloads for Vice City and 2.4m for GTA 3. Combined, that accounts for 18.1m downloads, meaning a further 10m downloads in December came from non-GTA games. That's approximately the same number of downloads Netflix generated in November, according to Appmagic.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a very hands-on kind of thing - each day you manually collect trash, wash and fold clothes, and unclog the toilet in first-person as you strive for greater front-of-shop efficiency and gradually expand your arcade empire - so it's a pretty natural fit for VR, where the whole immersive draw is getting to enthusiastically manipulate your virtual surroundings (and then throw something at a wall).\r\n\n\r\nIn Arcade Paradise VR, you can toss, rub, scrub, load, and clean using natural motions, then get stuck into those arcade games when not working your virtual fingers to the bone. Nosebleed's VR adaptation of Arcade Paradise features 39 playable cabinets, 27 of which have been carried across from the original - which featured a whole range of completely new, beautifully realised arcade games inspired by retro classics - plus 12 specific to VR.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Union membership numbers in the UK have risen significantly, following a tumultuous period in the video game industry (which still continues today).\r\n\n\r\nThe Game Workers branch of the IWGB union - which aims to \"end the institutionalised practice of excessive/unpaid overtime\" among other goals - told The Observer it saw its membership numbers increase by almost 50 percent between December 2022 and the end of last year. In October 2023 specifically, the union saw membership rise by 12 percent. This was soon after Fortnite developer Epic announced a wave of job cuts.\r\n\n\r\n\"It's felt like a deluge of redundancies in the past five or six months. It just keeps coming and coming,\" said Austin Kelmore, chair of the IWGB Game Workers branch. \"And with this wave, I've seen people saying 'we need to join unions'. Our membership went through the roof. We had the largest growth of new members in any month in our five-year history at the end of last year.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Ultimately, those ambitious plans were scaled back significantly following Cyberpunk's disastrous launch, finally fizzling out altogether - but with player sentiment around the franchise now considerably higher in light of last year's acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion, it's notable the studio could be looking to revive its multiplayer ambitions for a second outing.\r\n \nRead more",

Many lamented the show's direction, with it veering away from the source material in many ways. This not only included seeing Master Chief without his iconic helmet numerous times over, but also watching the mighty Spartan having a sexual relationship (something Schreiber has said was a \"huge mistake\"). \r\n\n\r\nHowever, things could be on the up for the show. Ahead of Halo's second season debut on Paramount Plus, the actor stated this series is going to be an improvement on the first. This is thanks to a different tone which is \"more appropriate for the franchise\", and - perhaps a key factor - better writing. \r\n \nRead more",

That's as the studio addresses the lack of 32-player dedicated servers on Xbox and PC Game Pass, saying the situation is \"not up to us\".\r\n\n\r\nPalworld's whole thing, if you're unfamiliar, is that it combines Pokémon-style creature catching with open-world survival and crafting, giving players the option to exploit (or eat) their Pals in the name of completing tasks more efficiently if they so choose.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a proposition that's evidently resonated with  players in a big way; Pocketpair has taken to social media to announce that Palworld \"has sold over 1m copies in about eight hours since release\". That's an astonishing number, particularly given that Palworld's day-one inclusion on Game Pass means plenty of people can play right now without directly purchasing the game.\r\n \nRead more",

But there was also the brilliant-looking Hellblade 2, the eye-catching sequel from Ninja Theory we've been looking forward to for years. \nThen there's Avowed, a fantasy RPG to satisfy those waiting patiently for the next Elder Scrolls and who might prefer a bit more colour to their role-playing than in Starfield. Finally, we saw Visions of Mana from Square Enix and Ara: History Untold for PC. But was this enough to make for a satisfying show - and more importantly, set the tone for what is hopefully a better year of Xbox first-party launches than in 2023? I'm joined by Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan to discuss. \n Read more",

Unfortunately, the region has now been \"beset by Daedric incursions and the encroaching jungles of Valenwood\", meaning there's heroing to be done.\r\n\n\r\nAs players journey across West Weald, they'll encounter new quests, challenges, rewards, and stories, with Gold Road's new main storyline - said to offer around 30 hours of quest content - focusing on Daedric prince Ithelia, and the chaos their followers may bring to Tamriel.\r\n \nRead more",

We officially now know it is coming this year. Get your fedoras at the ready, our beloved professor will be whipping his way onto Xbox Series X/S and PC, including Game Pass, in 2024.\r\n\n\r\nThanks to the new footage, which was shared at this evening's Xbox Developer Direct, we also have some nice background bits about the upcoming game, which we will play through the eyes of Indy as a lot of it is first person (it's the \"ideal perspective,\" the developer said). Oh, and Todd Howard also popped up to compliment how accommodating Lucasfilm has been. \r\n\n\r\nNow, let's talk new footage. It, of course, all started with Nazis, with the Great Circle taking place between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade (and yes, Indy looks like Harrison Ford complete with scar on chin). Oh, I really want this to be Xbox's Uncharted but more. The new footage provides plenty of little gameplay snippets that are also in the films, such as a hole filled with spiders that I assume has a lever inside. Indy is shown reaching in as a spider pops out, anyway. \r\n \nRead more",

It was a cheesy, atmospheric, and hugely enjoyable romp, establishing the template Supermassive would later revisit in its recent Dark Pictures Anthology series.\r\n\n\r\nGiven that much of Until Dawn's appeal came from the novelty of navigating through a whole bunch of knowingly trope-y slasher conventions (who hasn't pondered if they'd have what it takes to survive a horror movie and become Final Girl), it's perhaps an unexpected choice for a big screen adaptation - but the film's being described as a \"R-rated love letter to the horror genre\", suggesting it'll retain some of the meta elements of its inspiration.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has vowed more legal action against Apple, just days after the US Supreme Court dismissed both parties' further attempts to appeal a 2021 California court ruling on the Epic vs. Apple antitrust lawsuit.\r\n\n\r\nEpic initially launched court proceedings against Apple back in August 2020, after the company revoked Epic's Fortnite developer account, preventing the game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees.\r\n\n\r\nA decision on Epic's lawsuit came in September 2021, when Judge Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. Gonzalez-Rogers did, however, side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers from linking out to alternative payment methods from within their apps - a practice known as \"anti-steering\" - as that would constitute \"anti-competitive conduct\" under state law.\r\n \nRead more",

The long-awaited fix that developer Larian Studios recently promised would arrive this week is now available to download.\r\n\n\r\nXbox players have suffered save game woes ever since Baldur's Gate 3 made its delayed debut on the console at the end of last year, with reports soon emerging that hard-earned progress was being wiped after crashing. Unfortunately, the issue has persisted as the weeks have gone by, and Larian recently confirmed a permanent fix would require a console update from Microsoft, which was still in the works at the time.\r\n\n\r\nFinally though, after an agonising five-and-a-half-week wait, Microsoft's long-promised fix is now here. Its arrival was confirmed by the official Xbox Support account on social media, which tweeted, \"An Xbox System Update will be rolling out from today to address the Save Game issue on Baldur's Gate 3.\" All Xbox Series X/S players should automatically receive the update within the next week, it noted, but those wanting it sooner can manually force the update immediately via their console's Settings menu.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Sea of Thieves' 11th season is right around the corner, and it looks like its arrival next Tuesday, 23rd January, could very well bring the most radical overhaul for the multiplayer pirate adventure since its launch back in 2018. Behold the advent of fast-travel.\r\n\n\r\nAs per Rare's latest video update, Sea of Thieves' Season 11 makes sweeping changes to the way voyages are accessed and activated. Previously, voyages - essentially self-contained quests directing players to specific themed activities, if you're familiar - could only be purchased from trading company representatives at one of the game's starting outposts. That meant a whole lot of time spent engaged in often wholly uneventful sailing as you traversed back and forth across the map to pick up new voyages, drop off loot, and on.\r\n\n\r\nFrom Season 11 onward, however, all voyages will be immediately accessible at any time from the updated Quest Table on your ship. Here, you'll get on-demand access to trading company voyages (ranked by length), Tall Tales, and more, meaning you can dive straight into any voyage type you fancy without first needing to take a lengthy trip back to an outpost to buy it.\r\n \nRead more",

On Sonic's initial full reveal in the first trailer, many were left unimpressed (to put it mildly) by the direction the designers had gone. But even before that there was concern, when posters teasing Sonic's cinematic release showed the hedgehog's oddly lithe silhouette and his nightmarish legs.\r\n\n\r\nIn fact, the criticism surrounding Sonic's seemingly final look was so loud, the team went back to the drawing board and redesigned the titular blue hedgehog to a less controversial model. If you need a reminder, you can see the Sonic designs in the video below.\r\n \nRead more",

So, in just under two weeks.\r\n\n\r\nWhile Blizzard itself has not 'announced' this date at the time of writing, a message has been spotted in Diablo 4 itself proclaiming it to be so. As you can see in the image below, when players boot up the game, they are met with a notice on the character selection screen that reads: \"Season 3. Next season begins January 23, 2024\".\r\n \nRead more",
