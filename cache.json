It’s not enough for the average person to be afraid of cyberattacks. They need to know that there are engineering fixes&#8212;and that’s something we can provide.</p>\n<p>For decades, I have been waiting for the “big enough” incident that would finally do it. In 2015, Chinese military hackers hacked the Office of Personal Management and made off with the highly personal information of about 22 million Americans who had security clearances. In 2016, the Mirai botnet leveraged millions of Internet-of-Things devices with default admin passwords to launch a denial-of-service attack that disabled major Internet platforms and services in both North America and Europe. In 2017, hackers&#8212;years later we learned that it was the Chinese military&#8212;hacked the credit bureau Equifax and stole the personal information of 147 million Americans. In recent years, ransomware attacks have knocked hospitals offline, and many articles have been written about Russia inside the U.S. power grid. And last year, the Russian SVR hacked thousands of sensitive networks inside civilian critical infrastructure worldwide in what we’re now calling Sunburst (and used to call SolarWinds)...</p>",

This was my response.</p>\n<p>The penetration of government and corporate networks worldwide is the result of inadequate cyberdefenses across the board. The lessons are many, but I want to focus on one important one we’ve learned: the software that’s managing our critical networks isn’t secure, and that’s because the market doesn’t reward that security.</p>\n<p>SolarWinds is a perfect example. The company was the initial infection vector for much of the operation. Its trusted position inside so many critical networks made it a perfect target for a supply-chain attack, and its shoddy security practices made it an easy target...</p>",

In many ways, this circumstance reminds me of the cryptanalysis field in the 1990.

These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other&#8217;s existence with almost no interference...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "In a time where it seems every video game under the sun is getting its own adaptation of some sort, be it live-action TV series, full feature film or an episodic anime, we now have our first look at yet another one. And, you could say, things are falling into place for this particular film.\r\n\n\r\nTetris, starring Kingsman's Taron Egerton, is an origin story for the game. It is inspired by true events, and follows the story of Henk Rogers, the man that \"risked his life to outsmart the KGB and turn Tetris into a worldwide sensation\". The upcoming film takes place in 1988 when Rogers first discovers Tetris and \"risks everything by travelling to the Soviet Union\". Here, he teams up with Tetris' creator Alexey Pajitnov (played by The Thaw's Nikita Efremov) \"to bring the game to the masses\". \r\n\n\r\nIf you had told me this was actually going to be a thing a few days ago I would have scoffed, however having seen the trailer for it I have to say, it looks kind of great (also, I am a sucker Europe's \"The Final Countdown\", which features heavily in the trailer). You can see what you think about it for yourself via the video below.\r\n \nRead more",

Thankfully for both Ryōma and the game's run-time, that particular crisis is averted, and our lead embarks on a quest through 1860s Kyo that blends story, action, and mini-games in much the same vein as Yakuza.\r\n \nRead more",

Microsoft says this decreases fossil fuel dependency and CO2 emissions and could potentially saves users money. \r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, Microsoft once again highlights Xbox's Shutdown (energy saving) mode in its February update blog post, claiming it cuts power use by up to 20x compared to the Sleep power option.

We know nothing about it, but we do have the image below to whet our appetites:\r\n\n\r\nThe addition of a brand new 6v6 map to Modern Warfare 2 will be welcomed by fans who feel the game has suffered from a lack of content in comparison to Call of Duty's extraction mode DMZ and battle royale Warzone 2.0. Indeed, Modern Warfare 2 players reacted negatively when Activision revealed Season 2 includes two \"new\" maps: Dome and Valderas Museum. Dome is a remake of Dome from Infinity Ward's 2011 game Modern Warfare 3, and Valderas Museum was playable in the MW2 beta before failing to make the launch for some reason.\r\n \nRead more",

However, Ubisoft ultimately chose to drop the Tom Clancy branding after fans criticised the game - and its sassy specialists - for straying too far from the franchise's more serious military themes and formula.\r\n\n\r\nSince then, Ubisoft has quietly continued XDefiant's development, occasionally opening the game up to registered \"insiders\" as it seeks to garner feedback from players. Its latest closed Insider session runs from Thursday 16th February to Sunday 19th February (Monday 20th in the UK), and is the first to enable cross-play between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\r\n \nRead more",

Once 1.20 arrives, players will want to use their new archaeology tools to explore suspicious sand in search of sniffer eggs. Hatching these will eventually produce a fully grown sniffer, able to sniff out seeds long thought lost to time, but that when planted, will grow into unique blooms.\r\n\n\r\nAnd talk of blooms brings us nicely to Minecraft 1.20's other freshly announced addition: the aforementioned cherry blossom biome. As detailed in Mojang's blog, the large, fluffy trees that grow here attract the likes of pigs, sheep, and bees, causing them to spawn in the area. \r\n \nRead more",

It featured a frontlit (later changed to be backlit) screen that has since become standard, and a highly portable clamshell design that paved the way for Nintendo DS. But its marketing here in the UK now looks more than a little more dated. \r\n\n\r\nOriginally released in Japan 20 years ago today, and then here in Europe on 28th March, there's no doubting the SP was a sleekly-designed piece of kit. The original Game Boy Advance was compact enough, but could also never escape looking like a toy - something a kid might try and conjure a Digimon out of in a particularly energetic play session. \r\n\n\r\nThe SP, on the other hand, was intended to appear a more grown-up device and was therefore marketed as such. Its colours were more muted - its all-silver option made its hinged design look like a small laptop. Its angular shape was more business-like (and its dinky shoulder buttons rather less ergonomic to hold down). But all of this made sense - right? Nintendo already had a successful Game Boy Advance for the younger market. This one was for a different and more narrowly-targeted demographic - something its advertising also reflected.\r\n \nRead more",

On its release, the game tasked players with traversing a futuristic subway-style map, with each 'stop' on the line challenging them to clear blocks at the end of a long room within a certain amount of time. This was all done by using a ball and racquet, offering players an experience somewhere between Breakout and squash.\r\n\n\r\nNow, 22 years later, the game is being brought back and reimagined for the PSVR2. This upcoming release is known as C-Smash VRS (the VRS stands for \"VR\" and \"versus\") and is being developed by RapidEyeMovers along with VR veterans Wolf & Wood (which is known for VR games such as The Exorcist: Legion VR and Hotel R'n'R).

It sees up to four player taking to the streets of Junktown and using their robo-abilities to eliminate anyone that gets in their way. It promises 25 stages across five distinct areas, over 100 customisable truck parts, online and local co-op, competitive mini-games, and more when it launches for PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC later this year.\r\n\n\r\nNext up is Animal Well, the first game from YouTuber videogamedunkey's publishing company Bigmode. It's a Metroidvania from solo developer Shared Memory and sees players exploring a surreal labyrinthine filled with animals and secrets. Shared Memory discusses their goals for the game on the PlayStation Blog, explaining how they're creating a core experience that's accessible for all, but with deeper layers of mystery for those that like to probe and explore. There's no release date for Animal Well yet but it's coming to PS5 and PC.\r\n \nRead more",

There are also bosses that reward new weapons on defeat - opening up new routes in later areas - plus two-player co-op for those that want to play with a friend. Additionally, Inti promises extensive difficulty options with the game's Style System, and unique changes on repeat plays. \r\n \nRead more",

Take-Two alleged the fans had distributed \"derivative GTA source code\" and had infringed copyright, and demanded GitHub remove the projects once and for all. \n Read more",

Just today, it was listed among the list of titles recently released by publisher Take-Two that reviewed positively but - for whatever reason - failed to set tills ringing. \r\n\n\r\nReleased in December, Midnight Suns offers a strong story-based single-player experience that alternates between easy-to-understand turn-based combat and an RPG-style hub where you hang out and befriend the superheroes you've recruited onto your team. The fights are fun and fast-paced. The story is well-written, and the interactions between Marvel characters frequently brilliant. There's a lot to love.\r\n\n\r\nI never felt the game's marketing properly spelled all of that out - and as someone who has not played XCOM before, I was initially unsure about leaping into my first Firaxis game. Ultimately I took the plunge and came away very happily surprised.\r\n \nRead more",
