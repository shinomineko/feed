          "description": "<p>In February, Meta released its large language model: LLaMA. Unlike OpenAI and its ChatGPT, Meta didn&#8217;t just give the world a chat window to play with. Instead, it released the code into the open-source community, and shortly thereafter the model itself was leaked. Researchers and programmers immediately started modifying it, improving it, and getting it to do things no one else anticipated. And their results have been immediate, innovative, and an indication of how the future of this technology is going to play out. Training speeds have hugely increased, and the size of the models themselves has shrunk to the point that you can create and run them on a laptop. The world of AI research has dramatically changed...</p>",

The problem with most homework machines is that they&#8217;re too perfect.

Most importantly, the machine&#8217;s &#8220;handwriting&#8221; is too consistent. Humans always include small variations in their writing, no matter how honed their penmanship...</p></blockquote>",

The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you&#8217;ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans­&#8212;one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn&#8217;t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has...</p></blockquote>",

Modification and\nremoval of the security profiles are managed by the operator in the same way,\nbut that’s a small subset of its capabilities.\nAnother core feature of the SPO is being able to stack seccomp profiles.

The extremely enjoyable adventure is poised to receive its \"gigantic\" free Puzzler's Pack DLC next Tuesday, 6th June.\r\n\n\r\nShovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon, if you're unfamiliar, sees the titular spade-wielding hero try his hand at block-falling puzzle-action. Across a procession of single-screen dungeons, players must dodge perpetually tumbling enemies and obstacles then smack chains of them into oblivion, keeping things clear long enough to eventually escape. It's a lot more nuanced than that, though, and clever enough that Eurogamer's Christian Donlan slapped its \"lovely balance of precision and chaos\" with a Recommended badge in 2022.\r\n\nAnyway, the already surprisingly ample package is set to expand again on Tuesday, when Pocket Dungeon's Puzzler's Pack DLC arrives on PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile via Netflix. It adds Puzzle Knight and Mona as playable chracters - the first able to rotate surrounding foes clockwise to create new combos, the latter armed with alchemist abilities that can explode nearby potions - plus new battles, boons, bosses, feats, and a \"ton\" of relics.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a bit of an underwhelming follow-up, but it does offer a couple of improvements, including larger maps, more diverse biomes, and a new Chaos Theory mode revisiting key movie moments.\r\n\n\r\nTrek to Yomi (PS4, PS5), meanwhile, comes from Shadow Warrior studio Flying Wild Hog, and takes players on an striking black-and-white adventure inspired by cinema's classic samurai tales. In more practical terms, it blends side-scrolling platforming with sword combat - a mixture that didn't quite grab Eurogamer's Robert Purchese when he took a look last year.\r\n \nRead more",

The officially-licenced Mega Man slippers will be available this summer (23rd June, to be precise). \r\n\n\r\nClothing and costume store Fun has unveiled this new pair of Mega Man slippers, which have been designed to resemble Mega Man's classic series look. They have a stitched Mega Man on the side, and red emblems on the sole. Surely, a much more comfortable option for lounging around the house in than Mega Man's own, robotic booties.\r\n \nRead more",

It's widely considered to be the granddaddy of the survival horror genre, pioneering the fixed-camera spook-house formula that would go on to influence the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill.\r\n\n\r\nTHQ Nordic's reimagined version of Alone in the Dark - which is being handled by Swedish developer Pieces Interactive with Soma and Amnesia: The Dark Descent writer Mikael Hedberg at the helm - takes the basic premise of the 1992 original, in which private detective Edward Carnby helps Emily Hartwood investigate her uncle's suicide at the gloomy Derceto Mansion, and cranks up the Southern Gothic as it attempts to filter the originals' blend of exploration, combat, puzzles, and story through a more modern lens.\r\n \nRead more",

It was a wonderfully refreshing thing, taking everything you'd expect from an action-RPG - real-time combat, dungeon crawling, and equipment progression - and turning it into a breezy, super-streamlined, pick-up-and-play package. It also had more cat puns than is probably legal.\r\n\n\r\nA sequel arrived two years later, offering a slightly evolved take on the original's formula - most notably introducing dogs (and, yes, dog puns) - and now The Gentlebros is getting ready to do it all over again in Cat Quest: Pirates of the Purribean.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There were plenty of announcements during Sony's Playstation Showcase last night, but the one that stood out most to me was Phantom Blade Zero. This quickfire action RPG looks brilliant and oh so slick. It blends Chinese martial arts and punk together, to create a new direction its developer has dubbed \"Kungfupunk\".\r\n\n\r\nIn Phantom Blade Zero, you take on the role of Soul. According to Soulframe Liang, founder of the game's developer S-Game, Soul is \"an elite assassin serving an elusive but powerful organisation known simply as 'The Order'.\" Soul was framed for the murder of this organisation's patriarch, and was then wounded in the \"manhunt that ensued\". Thankfully, he was saved from death by a \"mystic healer\". \r\n\n\r\nThis all sounds enticing enough already, in my opinion, but there is more. While Soul may have been saved by this healer, there is a catch - the cure only lasts for 66 days, and Soul needs to find out who framed him for killing The Order's patriarch before time runs out. Of course, this will not be an easy job, and Soul will have to fight against \"powerful foes and inhuman monstrosities\" on his journey. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Well! Bungie has finally unveiled its next project, and it's quite a surprise, whisking the developer back to its 90s roots for a revival of its classic first-person shooter series Marathon, reimagined as a PvP shooter for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Marathon released in 1994 and went on to spawn two sequels, at which point Microsoft swooped in to purchase Bungie and the Halo franchise was born. Since then, Bungie has been on a quite the journey, working its way through multiple Halo sequels and two Destiny games, the latter of which have kept the studio busy for over a decade. So it's kind of fascinating to see it cast its gaze backward for its first new project as a Sony-owned studio.\r\n\n\r\nThe new Marathon is described as a \"sci-fi PvP extraction shooter\" featuring \"evolving, persistent zones\" that, while not a direct sequel to the earlier games, is set in the same universe. \"PvP\" is the key here, too with Bungie confirming it won't have a single-player campaign. It will, however, support cross-play and cross-save between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\r\n \nRead more",

While the exact line-up still appears to be in flux, Keighley does say he expects the Summer Game Fest live show to feature three or four things that are \"pretty big for this audience.\"\r\n \nRead more",

It continued to work on the WWE licence until 2018's WWE 2K19, when publisher 2K decided to hand the reins exclusively to the US-based Visual Concepts, which had co-developed the series with Yuke's since 2013. Unfortunately, Visual Concepts' solo debut proved so disastrous 2K made the unprecedented move of skipping the long-running series' annual release for two years in a row, only bringing it back in 2022.\r\n\n\r\nSo with WWE 2K temporarily out of commision, wrestling fans were quite intrigued when, in 2020, it was announced Yuke's would be returning to the genre with a game for WWE rival AEW, under the watch of publisher THQ Nordic. And we'll finally get a chance to see what the developer's been up when AEW: Fight Forever launches this June.\r\n \nRead more",

Crucially in Maquette, changes made to one environment affect the other - so if you were to, say, place a cube in a tiny courtyard in front of you, it would then materialise in the full-size courtyard you stand in, giving you a means to progress to the next area - and on it goes.\r\n \nRead more",

The 8GB card is the first to be released, with sales beginning on May 24th, while the 16GB variant debuts in July. The firm also detailed its mainstream RTX 4060 GPU, also coming in July, to debut at $299. \nAll three models ought to offer a reasonable boost in performance over their predecessors, while also adding DLSS 3 frame generation - which is perhaps more impactful on mid-range hardware than it is on the likes of the RTX 4090 which is powerful enough without it. That should allow the 4060 family to be a reasonable choice for gaming at 1080p with maxed settings (including RT / DLSS), or at 1440p with some settings reductions. \nOn average, Nvidia is claiming the 4060 Ti is 1.15x faster than the 3060 Ti and 1.6x faster than the 2060 Super (1.7x and 2.6x faster with DLSS 3). Similarly, the RTX 4060 is 1.2x faster than RTX 3060 and 1.6x faster than RTX 2060 (1.7x and 2.3x with DLSS 3). \n Read more",

At the time, Russian studio MiST Land South was attached as its developer, but after that arrangement failed to reach fruition, original publisher Strategy First went through a succession of studios with similarly unsuccessful results before the Jagged Alliance rights changed hands in 2010.\r\n\n\r\nFive years later, the rights pinballed again, this time to Nordic Games, and six years after that, THQ Nordic revealed that finally, finally, development on a third entry in the Jagged Alliance series would resume, this time under the watch of Tropico developer Haemimont Games.\r\n \nRead more",

It's set during a period when the country's football team was on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time, helping instil a sense of hope in a population still reeling from a major financial crisis. \r\n\n\r\nThat translates to \"bittersweet and sometimes dreamy\" game of kick-abouts and conversations, in which sees players - viewing the world through the eyes and ears of eight-year-old Julián - explore a dense corner of Quito, \"full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to\".\r\n \nRead more",

Link is also making his merry way through Hyrule's many regions and camps in a range of eclectic creations, from mechs to trucks and tanks.\r\n\n\r\nAs a reminder, Link's new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects, and with a bit of creativity players can conjure up their own vehicles and such to beetle across Hyrule. \r\n\n\r\nWhile I have been happy enough to just place a fan on the back of my timber board to make it go, others clearly have a much better imagination (and a lot more patience, I won't lie, I am still finding Ultrahand quite fiddly to get the hang of) than I do. As a result, there have been some truly remarkable Ultrahand designs making the rounds online. \r\n \nRead more",

As with its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, Link can search the lands of Hyrule to find these woodland spirits, and return the seeds to Hestu. As in Breath of the Wild, Hestu will then add these seeds to his prized maracas, do a little shimmy, and grant you a new weapon slot. It's all very wholesome. \r\n\n\r\nOr, at least it was in Breath of the Wild. However, Tears of the Kingdom has upped the ante when it comes to Korok puzzles. This time around, Link often has to reunite two separated Korok companions. This sounds innocent enough - who doesn't want to see two long lost friends reunited? Well, apparently many Tears of the Kingdom players, that's who. \r\n\n\r\nThanks to the sequel's new Ultrahand ability, which allows Link to pick up, move, and rotate objects (including Koroks), many players out there have taken to fusing these poor blighters to homemade crucifixes, rockets and even spit roasting the innocent spirits.\r\n \nRead more",

Along with the sequel's new-look Hyrule, Link also has a range of new abilities that can help him on his journey to once again rid the kingdom of the many evils that have made their home there. \r\n\n\r\nOne such ability is Ascend, which allows Link to pass through solid objects above him. This is a game changer when it comes to traversal, as Link no longer has to necessarily negotiate the weather and his stamina to make his way up cliffs and the like. Now, he can find some kind of overhang and pop up and through to create seemingly impossible shortcuts. \r\n\n\r\nHowever, this useful new ability wasn't always going to make it into Tears of the Kingdom's final release. In fact, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma and game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi revealed it actually started off as a debug cheat function not intended for the game. \r\n \nRead more",

It is now afternoon, and there's still no sign of it. To save myself from twiddling my thumbs while staring mindlessly at the wall, I decided to check out Flappy Souls.\r\n\nFlappy Souls is a new, free release on Steam. It is marketed as being \"a mix of Flappy Bird and Dark Souls\", hence the name. The premise is remarkably simple - you have to fly around as a baseball cap-wearing bird while dodging obstacles. Smattered through these obstacles are souls that you have to collect, and as you progress you level up. And that's it. Easy, right? No, not right. This game is HARD! \r\n\n\r\nNow, before I get too into it, let me ask - are you the kind of person who ducks a little when you go under a low bridge in a car? I am. For some reason, I have it hardwired into my brain that physically ducking will somehow ensure safer passage. Logically, of course, I know it makes absolutely no sense. If my car isn't going to fit, me ducking, or breathing in when I pass another vehicle on a slightly narrower stretch of road, isn't going to change that. And yet, I still do it. \r\n \nRead more",

Dungeons! Mitherflipping dungeons are returning in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom!\r\n\n\r\nMore specifically - according to Nintendo's Hidemaro Fujibayashi, speaking in a new Ask the Developer interview - \"huge\", \"traditional\" dungeons are making their return to the Legend of Zelda series in Tears of the Kingdom after their conspicuous absence in Breath of the Wild.\r\n\n\r\nTears of the Kingdom's predecessor saw Nintendo shake up the traditional Zelda formula in a big way, not just in its sprawling open-world, but by replacing lengthy, elaborate dungeons - which have been part of the Zelda series since its inception in 1986 - with micro-dungeon-like Shrines and more expansive, although largely forgettable, Divine Beasts.\r\n \nRead more",

Speedrunning communities exist to share tricks and glitches that sometimes see entire areas skipped - because someone managed to crouch next to that one specific bit of wall while holding that one specific sword in their left hand (or something like that).\r\n\n\r\nEA is clearly aware of this, and has implemented an in-game message that triggers if a player reaches an area that should be, in theory, unreachable at that point in the game. Should this happen, a warning will pop up on the player's screen stating \"an unexpected error\" has occurred. \r\n \nRead more",
