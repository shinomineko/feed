With the growing adoption of multicloud and multicluster deployments, the work SIG Multicluster doing is gaining a lot of attention.

          "description": "If, like me, you've been eagerly awaited news of Portal 3 for the last decade and a bit, I'm afraid today is still not your lucky day. Valve does, however, have some hitherto unseen Portal on the way for your tearily grateful playing pleasure in the form of a free interactive tutorial thingy for Steam Deck - titled Aperture Desk Job and launching next week.\nAdmittedly, \"interactive tutorial\" sounds neither riveting nor sexy, which is probably why Valve is referring to its new Steam Deck experience as a \"free playable short\". But what actually is it?, you may be wondering. Well, in much the same way as Valve returned to the Portal universe for its entirely endearing Steam VR performance test a few years back, Aperture Desk Job is designed to walk Steam Deck owners through their new handheld's controls and features, \"while not being nearly as boring as that sounds.\"\nRead more",

That, though, is set to change with today's new Sentinel update, which brings with an much-needed combat overhaul along with AI mechs and robotic drone pals, plus other miscellaneous combat-focused additions.\nAccording to Hello Games, Sentinel - No Man's Sky's first update of 2022 - is intended to make combat a more \"dynamic and impactful\" experience, providing the means to tackle the game's hostile robotic Sentinels in \"more meaningful ways\" To that end, the update brings with it a broad array of improvements and refinements focused on enhancing combat feel and flow, as detailed in the latest patch notes. The headline features, however, are highlighted below.\nRead more",

In gameplay terms, that translates to a wonderfully inventive split-screen platformer where careful co-operation is key.
