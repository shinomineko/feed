This was a success with many cloud providers: AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, GCP, Metal3, vSphere and still counting.\nWith extensibility addressed, the focus shifted to features, like automatic control plane …",

That’s because you need first to download\nall the data from a source block storage provider to compute and then send\nit back to a storage provider again. There’s a lot of network traffic and CPU/RAM used in this process.\nHardware acceleration by offloading certain expensive operations to dedicated hardware is\nalways a huge performance boost.
