Specifically, we apply fluid dynamics to estimate the arrangement of the human vocal tract during speech generation and show that deepfakes often model impossible or highly-unlikely anatomical arrangements. When parameterized to achieve 99.9% precision, our detection mechanism achieves a recall of 99.5%, correctly identifying all but one deepfake sample in our dataset.</p></blockquote>\n<p>From an <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/deepfake-audio-has-a-tell-researchers-use-fluid-dynamics-to-spot-artificial-imposter-voices-189104\">article...</a></p>",

Two reasons: First, many customers don’t have an ongoing relationship with the hardware and software providers that protect their funds­&#8212;nor do they have an incentive to update security on a regular basis. Turning to a new security provider or using updated software creates risks; leaving everything the way it was feels safer. So users won’t be rushing to pay for and install new security patches...</p></blockquote>",

So it was nice to see the community pick up the little clues that we did sprinkle everywhere that, yes, indeed, we envisioned Deathloop to be happening in the future after [the third Dishonored game] Death of the Outsider.\"\r\n \nRead more",

And to clear up any doubt, that's made explicit by an attached label confirming an 18th October Steam release.\r\n \nRead more",

The first four of those are free-roaming, meaning you can plop them wherever you please, while the Egyptian Fruit Bat is restricted to a walkthrough exhibit.\r\n\n\r\nPlayers looking to infuse their zoos with a touch of gothic flair for Halloween can make use of the Twilight Pack's 200 new scenery items, ranging from castle-themed building parts - including gargoyles and an imposing portcullis - to glowing pumpkins and cauldrons. Even the flora is getting a bit spooky, with Bristlecone pine trees, ivy, and bioluminescent ghost fungus.\r\n \nRead more",

This, in turn, brings four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, the expansive Ohn'ahran Plains, the frozen Azure Span, and the majestic Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.\r\n\n\r\nDragonflight also introduces a new playable race-class hybrid (a first for WoW) known as the Dracthyr Evokers, which can switch between human and draconic forms. Depending on a player's chosen class specialisations, its focus is either damage dealing or healing.\r\n \nRead more",

The extent of Stadia's failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.\r\n\n\r\nAnd while Google continued to insist Stadia was \"alive and well\" as 2021 progressed, reports claimed it had \"deprioritised\" the consumer-facing side of its game streaming platform, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services' underlying technology to third-parties.\r\n \nRead more",

Subsequent expansions, not included with Epic's freebie, have upped the sci-fi and fantasy factor, which, if you enjoy the base game's rhythms, you might find more to your taste.\r\n \nRead more",

Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an 'isometric/top-down' perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.\r\n \nRead more",

Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do \"love exploring\".

Furthermore, multiplayer and touchscreen support are reportedly being added to all previous Switch instalments at the same time.\r\n\n\r\nPicross S8, as this newest entry is known, follows the same familiar formula as its predecessors - each stage requiring players to complete a picture on a grid by solving numerical clues indicating which squares must be filled in - but adds a bit of spice to proceedings by letting four players put their heads together to tackle each challenge.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to the official Picross website, it's local multiplayer only (the trailer suggests there's a score-based component despite everyone working co-operatively to complete the same puzzle), and each player will need their own controller to participate. \r\n \nRead more",

After said streams have ended, the recordings are often viewed by hundreds of other accounts - far more than expected for small channels their size.\r\n\n\r\nThe report suggests this is due to \"hundreds\" of accounts believed to be used by predators, which have collated follower lists each with \"more than 1000 kids on their following lists\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Apple has announced it will be raising its App Store prices in multiple territories - including every country that uses the euro, but excluding the UK at present - starting on 5th October.\r\n\n\r\nAs per an update shared with developers, which did not provide an explanation for the impending price hike, Apple said the move will impact all tiers of its App Store pricing chart in the following areas: Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, Vietnam, and all territories that use the euro currency. \r\n\n\r\nWhen the pricing changes come into effect on 5th October, App Store items previously priced at €0.99 will, for instance, increase to €1.19, while apps formerly costing €9.99 will rise to €11.99. App Store developers who offer subscriptions will, however, have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Earlier today, Nvidia finally revealed the new RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 video cards, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. We've been hands-on with the RTX 4090 for the last few days and we're hard at work on content focusing on the firm's latest AI-based frame generation technology - DLSS 3.\nFirst impressions on the RTX 4090 itself though? It's easily one of the biggest gen-on-gen increases in performance we've seen, even based on limited testing. 4K gaming for higher refresh rate monitors and TVs is not a problem on most modern titles - and by extension, 8K at 60fps is now viable if you're one of the crazy few (like me) that actually has an 8K TV. Combine that increase in performance with the new DLSS 3 - with its AI-based frame generation - and suddenly the most intense workloads in PC gaming play out with unerring fluidity.\nWe were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already sunk a full weekend into it, we're not done yet and need some extra time - so with that being the case, we've put together a teaser video showing some of the work we've already done.\n Read more",

Its feverishly anticipated sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, has finally been confirmed for release on PS4 and PS5.\r\n\n\r\nHollow Knight: Silksong has, of course, been a long time coming, with Team Cherry first announcing the game all the way back in February 2019. Even now, some three and a half years later, specifics around Silksong remain limited, but we do at least know it'll offer a twist on its predecessor's non-linear exploration, platforming, and combat thanks to a new protagonist, Hornet, with her own distinct abilities.\r\n\n\r\nGiven how very excellent the original Hollow Knight was, that's still more than enough to warrant excitement, and Switch, Xbox, and PC players have been able to rest easy knowing Silksong would - eventually, at least - be available on their system to play.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a survival horror adventure, of sorts - one heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - that sees players guiding four different characters through a mysterious ancient village steeped in murky rituals.\r\n\n\r\nThe goal of Saturnalia is to investigate, and ultimately solve, the mystery of village, but there are shadowy things in the night determined to stop you. Should you get captured as one character, you can switch to another and attempt a rescue - but once all four characters are dead, the village gets to reassert itself, its labyrinthine layout physically reconfiguring for another attempt. Narrative and puzzle progress, however, is retained across game-overs.\r\n \nRead more",

The pair will share the same engine, a first for the Call of Duty franchise and one that should ensure parity and a more consistent feature set - all of which makes this feel like something of a new dawn for the series. Warzone 2.0 introduces the new desert map of Al Mazrah, plus some of its own twists on the battle royale formula such as multiple circles appearing in certain end-game scenarios. It'll also feature a new AI faction, with Strong Holds harbouring loot patrolled by NPCs, and a tweaked Gulag system. There will also be a new sandbox mode called DMZ, and while details remain slim it does indeed sound like Warzone's take on Escape from Tarkov. \r\n\n\r\nLike other popular battle royale titles it will also feature a third-person view - something entirely new for Warzone 2.0, and an addition that will likely be the subject of some debate. Third-person playlists will also be available in Modern Warfare 2, harking back to the third-person mode that was available in the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 back in 2009.\r\n \nRead more",

It sees up to 13 players working together - or otherwise - in order to unmask Conspirators hiding in a village beset by murders. Those cast as Villagers must weed out the suspects by day, while those in the role of Conspirators can decide who should be bumped off next by night.\r\n \nRead more",

These work in tandem with new pedestrian zones which can be augmented with new policies, such as Slow Driving (reducing the speed limit for all vehicles in the area to 20km an hour), and Street Music, which boosts happiness in pedestrianised commercial zones at the expense of noise pollution.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years (two years!) before its April Fool's Day announcement a few months ago. \nSpeaking via video call, it was clear the trio had a great passion for what they do - and also an oversized Stan S. Stanman cutout, which loomed over Gilbert's shoulder. (This turned out to be a prop from a recent PAX trip liberated by Gilbert, thanks to the series' iconic distraction of \"Look! A three-headed monkey\". Apparently, this move works \"every time\".)\nIn addition to sharing more about Return to Monkey Island, including details of its under-wraps hint system, we spoke about the future of the series, scrapped plans to break up Guybrush and Elaine, and even ideas for Elaine Marley to lead her own game - as well as some Monty Python influences thrown in for good measure.\n Read more",

          "description": "Square Enix's upcoming fantasy farming game Harvestella is getting a Switch eShop demo today, ahead of its 4th November release.\r\n\n\r\nHarvestella - a sort of blend of Final Fantasy, Harvest Moon, and Rune Factory - casts players as an amnesiac who wakes up in a world where the seasons are governed by four giant crystals known as Seaslight. Unfortunately for the locals, something has gone awry and a deadly dust known as the Quietus has started seeping from the crystals, trapping people indoors and causing crops to wither and die.\r\n\n\r\nWhat follows is a familiar blend of farming, socialising, and adventuring that sees players growing crops to raise the money needed to buy new farming and adventuring equipment - the latter helping players gradually push deeper into Harvestella's dungeon-like regions where they'll encounter enemies and bosses, and gather resources required elsewhere.\r\n \nRead more",

Great name, too).\nThe sequel takes place in a new era and involves eight new characters whose adventures you'll get to individually play. The era appears to be more modern and reminds me of a kind of 18th/19th Century. There are huge, ocean-going ships but also trains of a kind, probably steam. And it looks as deliciously dinky and delicate as Octopath Traveler did before it.\nCharacters will also apparently now have different path actions at day and night, and there's specific mention of their stories intertwining in this game.\n Read more",

And yeah, it went kind of viral in a way - that's not the direction that we thought it was going to go! But I have to admit, some of the memes are actually pretty funny, so I got a good laugh out of it. \r\n\n\r\n\"But, you know, for us, it's not something that we're concerned with. We're obviously leaving a lot of information on the table, because we're taking dialogue and scenes out of context. Forspoken is a very narrative driven game. It's a very story based game. We don't want to ruin the experience in our marketing campaign. We're being very selective about what to use to generate interest and sometimes without that information about what led up to that moment, or what was the character's state of mind, we're leaving the audience the full freedom to interpret lines in any way they want. It's just one of those challenges that come naturally when trying to find ways to show the game without telling the full story, because we definitely don't want to reveal that.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Though originally slated to release in April this year, it was pushed to the first half of 2023 and the fact there's no solid date is reportedly why Xbox is offering refunds. \r\n \nRead more",

And this week, I sat down with several of the game's Bordeaux-based development team for a deeper dive into what was shown publicly today. Read on for details of djinn, a popular rumour seemingly being denied, and more details on that Prince of Persia crossover.\r\n\nMirage is set in Baghdad and begins in the year 861, when the city enjoyed a golden age where it was a commercial and cultural crossroads. It was home to all manner of faces from all parts of the known world - a perfect cast for an Assassin's Creed game - and also, of course, future Master Assassin himself, Basim Ibn Ishaq. When the game begins, we meet Basim several decades before his journey to England and arrival in the story of 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Here, on the streets of Baghdad, Basim begins as a petty thief, who catches the eye of the Hidden Ones.\n Read more",

          "description": "There are lots of very good things about From Software's majestic Elden Ring, but one of the very best good things - as is the case with much of the developer's games - is its sublime soundtrack. And now publisher Bandai Namco has made the entire thing officially available to listen to across a wide range of music streaming services.\r\n\n\r\nThe newly released digital soundtrack runs a total of 34 tracks, variously composed by Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Yuka Kitamura, Yoshimi Kudo, and Tai Tomisawa - many of whom are long-time From Software collaborators, having worked on the likes of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Bloodborne.\r\n\n\r\nTheir cumulative expertise on Elden Ring, though, has created a belter of a soundtrack, and now users of Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, the iTunes Store, YouTube Music, Tidal, Qobuz, and Deezer can relive their adventures in the Lands Between through the power of sonic reminiscence.
