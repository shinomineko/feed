          "description": "In news that'll surprise nobody who's been following the various leaks leading up to today's official announcement, Capcom has confirmed Dragon's Dogma 2 will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 22nd March next year.\r\n\n\r\nThat date first emerged earlier this month, when it was spotted as part of a (quickly removed) listing on the PEGI ratings website. It then prematurely resurfaced on Steam today, getting a little ahead of Capcom's latest Dragon's Dogma 2 showcase where it was finally made official.\r\n\n\r\nAnd official it now is, with Dragon's Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirming the news during a 15-minute livestream that also featured a lengthy new trailer. Tucked in there was an appearance from the previously unseen Talos, a truly colossal armoured soldier striding forth from the depths of the ocean that Capcom seems particularly proud of - so much so that we got an extended look at the fight once the trailer was over.\r\n \nRead more",

And as its new confirmed December launch window approaches, the studio has shared a heap of new information on what to expect come the expansion's release, including confirmation it'll arrive alongside cross-save support.\r\n\n\r\nWhispers in the Walls introduces new mission types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set. It's an expansion primarily focused on the long-hidden laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos, and one that'll reveal the \"proverbial big bang\" that kicked off every event in Warframe.\r\n\n\r\nIn terms of enemies, the labyrinthine laboratory plays host to a much-expanded Necramech faction, including new Necrodogs, that players can battle using Whispers in the Walls' new Grimoire, a secondary weapon capable of flinging pages of devastating Void. But that's not the expansion's only new threat; at certain points, players will find themselves whisked away from the gothic gloom of Albrecht's lab to a vast Eldritch desert that serves as the home of the mysterious Man in the Wall. Here, they'll encounter a second new faction, the Murmur, nightmarish multi-limbed creatures resembling tech-infused biblical angels.\r\n \nRead more",

Furher evidence backing this up arrived in July, when actor and singer Luke Charles Stafford shared a Facebook post referencing Black Ops and claiming his likeness would be used for next year's main character, \"Ratcliff\".\r\n\n\r\nAnd that brings us to a new report from Windows Central which, citing \"multiple sources familiar with Activision's plans\", says next year's Call of Duty \"is indeed Black Ops\". The publication also claims the game will attempt to \"explore a nuanced narrative of the Gulf War, with a critical focus on different participants within the conflict.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Being a PvPvE experience, the threats outside are twofold: there're the zombies - which can't be killed, meaning stealth is key to survival - alongside other human scavengers, who'll either need to be avoided or set upon with makeshift weaponry (firearms are a scare commodity).\r\n\n\r\nPlayers can come and go as they like, meaning once they're satisfied with their haul, they can return to the safe zone, where Nakwon's more simulation-focused activities occur. Here, hard-gained resources can be sold for money, which is used to increase Citizen Grades and secure better priveliges and benefits. \"Every day, you must decide whether to go out for Scouting or staying inside,\" Mintrocket explained previously. \"But, you must consistently secure more food to avoid starvation and make the best choice whenever an unexpected event occurs.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Court documents from the ongoing Epic Games vs Google antitrust case reveal the internet giant wanted to take over the Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer, and was willing to work with shareholder Tencent to complete a buyout.\nA quick reminder of how we got here: in August 2020, Epic implemented a method to circumvent Apple and Google fees on in-game payments in the iOS and Android versions of Fortnite. The two platform-holders swiftly retaliated by pulling the game from their storefronts. Epic subsequently filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google, and the case against Apple was settled in September 2021 in favour of Apple on nine of 10 counts. Earlier this year, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulings after appeals from both parties.\nNow Epic is back in court to wage its case against Google. While the court battle between Epic and Apple brought us the bizarre moment in which banana mascot Peely's decency was questioned in (apologies, in the tuxedo he's known as Agent Peely), so far the proceedings with Google have been revealing in a slightly different way.\n Read more",

          "description": "Epic Games has promised fixes to remedy early issues with Fortnite's newly introduced age ratings system, which has left players frustrated after many popular cosmetics have become unusable in certain parts of the game in order to meet ratings requirements.\r\n\n\r\nLast month bought the news Epic would be introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it called its evolution into a \"multi-game ecosystem\". Epic is, of course, currently trying to expand the reach of Fortnite by placing a greater focus on Roblox-style user-generated experiences build using its recently released Creative 2.0 tools - and the game's latest update means all these experiences now come with age ratings, starting at E for Everyone and going through E10+ up to Teen.\r\n\n\r\nSo far, so sensible. The problem is the seemingly haphazard way all this has been implemented in a game that has, up until now, been exclusively rated Teen. Essentially, as of Fortnite's latest update, every single bit of content, including all cosmetics, has been given its own age rating - and players are being prevented from accessing Creative mode experiences if they're wearing anything flagged as age-inappropriate. It doesn't help either, that seemingly benign cosmetics skins - a muscular cartoon cat, for instance - are rated Teen-only and considered unsuitable for children, while others, such as Halloween's Michael Myers are rated a-okay for the young 'uns.\r\n \nRead more",

Now, however, court documents reviewed by Axios quote Aspyr co-CEO Ted Saloch as saying the company \"believed it would be able to release the content, but a third party objected and Aspyr was unable to do so.\"\r\n \nRead more",

At this time, Studio Wildcard said it would update us with a release date before then. \r\n\n\r\nIt has now issued an update but rather than saying \"hazaar, it is finally here\", the studio has instead announced another delay. Again, the studio has not put an exact date on when Xbox Series X/S players can expect to see Ark: Survival Ascended arrive on consoles. It has simply said it is now \"targeting\" a release sometime early next week. \r\n \nRead more",

If you're looking to catch up on the excitement, or simply need a reminder, you'll find a full breakdown of everything featured during the show below.\r\n\n\r\nShantae Advance: Risky Revolution sees developer WayForward reviving the cancelled Game Boy Advance instalment of its acclaimed platform series nearly two decades on. To progress through its challenges, players will need to take advantage of Shantae's animal transformation abilities, as well as her newfoud power to rearrange stages by switching the foreground and background, and it'll also feature a 4-player local battle mode when it launches next year.\r\n\n\r\nDeveloper Pugstorm's Core Keeper is a \"mining sandbox adventure\" for up to eight players set in an \"endless\" procedurally generated cave system. There's an ancient mystery to be solved, but doing so requires players to hone their survival skills by mining for relics and resources, building bases, growing crops, and hatching pets, as they push further into the subtarrenean world and take on its monsters. This one's due to release for Switch in summer 2024.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Overwatch 2 players have discovered a strange bug that essentially traps players against an invisible wall, stopping them from moving and leaving them exposed to competitors.\r\n\nThe issue – which has been around for some time now – chiefly affects players on the Colosseo map, and sees players get trapped. Without the help of characters like Lifeweaver of Mei's movement abilities to bump them out of position, they'll stay trapped, too.\r\n\nDespite many players reporting they've also been stuck in this exact spot as a myriad of different players, it doesn't look like Blizzard's yet been able to address the problem. \r\n \nRead more",

Once a sufficient number of teams are signed up, Captain Briggsy appears to hand them all two maps maps - one pointing to a chest containing the fabled skull, the other to the key required to open it - whereupon a messy dash to retrieve them both is likely to ensue.

This has resulted in studios being closed, such as Saints Row developer Volition. Others, such as Epic, have seen their numbers significantly reduced. \r\n\n\r\nAccording to Zelnick, Take-Two has managed to avoid such consequences thanks to moderate investments and a focus on efficiency over recent years.\r\n \nRead more",

That means you won't have to lock down huge chunks of your profile just to avoid difficult questions about the amount of time you've been playing Coquettish Elbow Reveal VR Edition.

In 2009, after several difficult years, it was acquired by Crytek, becoming Crytek UK, who then sold it to Deep Silver in 2014, where it became Dambuster Studios - which made this year's Dead Island 2. However, in May 2021, Deep Silver announced it was reviving the Free Radical name and creating a new studio specifically to make more TimeSplitters, with original Free Radical co-founders Steve Ellis and David Doak at the helm.\r\n\n\r\nUnfortunately, VGC now reports this new Free Radical is the latest studio to be impacted by parent company Embracer Group's major restructuring programme, which was announced following the collapse of a massive $2bn deal in May and has resulted in extensive layoffs and closures throughout 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

And definitely not Mark Wahlberg as an aged Link from the future. \nWe also discuss the Zelda film's potential story, and whether we think it will adapt any particular Zelda legend or simply follow the Mario movie's example and go through the usual plot beats. Plus: the inevitable references Nintendo must include. And also... live-action Tingle? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan. \n Read more",

          "description": "Two months on from the release of Starfield, players are still waiting for Bethesda to address the numerous bugs which are present. But there's a whole other group of players out there taking matters into their own hands - the team behind the Starfield Community Patch, an ambitious and surprisingly professional taskforce trying to fix the game themselves. The project came under the spotlight about a month before Starfield released. It was wild to think that a group of modders could already be working on a mod for Starfield before it had even released, but there they were - anticipating the Bethesda jank fans have come to expect. \r\n\n\r\nThe SCP's goal is to improve the vanilla experience of Starfield for players by fixing everything from major bugs to spelling errors, so long as it presents some sort of issue for players of the base game. The scope of the patch doesn't include new content, balance changes (outside of correcting obvious errors), or anything which doesn't fit with Bethesda's original vision for the game.\r\n\n\r\nI spoke to Timothy \"Halgari\" Baldridge, one of the founders of the SCP, to find out why the team came together to, in essence, do Bethesda's work for them, and ask whether they've ever had any contact with Bethesda. I came away from our chat with a deeper appreciation for the project, which is more than just a simple effort to improve the experience of Starfield. It's a collaborative effort between several modders and players to create a truly community-owned, open-source project, with standard practices of software development in place.\r\n \nRead more",

And, as seen in his reveal trailer, Mauga - which means \"mountain\" in Samoan - is armed with two chainguns: affectionately known as Gunny and Cha-Cha.\r\n\n\r\nGunny is an incendiary chaingun, whose bullets will burn enemies that receive sufficient damage; Cha-Cha, meanwhile, is a a \"volatile\" chaingun that deals critical burn damage. Blizzard notes they can either be fired individually or in unison.\r\n \nRead more",

This new World of Warcraft story arc is set to play out across multiple expansions over the next few years, starting with The War Within - WoW's tenth expansion - in 2024.\r\n\n\r\nThe War Within takes players into heart of Azeroth itself, where they'll explore new subterranean kingdoms, engage with ancient cultures like the Earthen Dwarves - a new Allied race - and the terrifying Nerubians of Azj-Kahet. Azj-Kahet is one of several new zones coming in the expansion, alongside the Isle of Dorn, The Ringing Deeps, and Hallowfall.\r\n \nRead more",

As per studio Poncle's latest development update, a new story driven, lore-infused Adventures mode will soon be on the way.\r\n\n\r\nPoncle has teased Adventures before, describing them as a remix of content adding a bit of extra \"flavour\" through new stage progression and descriptions. Now though, via the medium of FAQ it's gone into considerably more detail, explaining Adventures are essentially self-contained miniature story campaigns - some available as part of the base game, others tied to specific DLC - that'll follow the game's cast of Survivors on a series of \"wacky sidequests.\"\r\n\n\r\nAdventures unlock at set points during the main game or their associated DLC, and feature a unique progression path that'll see players starting from scratch (main game unlocks won't be affected) using a specific character and item set-up as they attempt to complete a series of custom challenges with a limited arsenal. Those challenges might, for instance, require players to survive a certain amount of time or kill a set amount of enemies, and there'll be bits of lore text forming a mini story arc along the way.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "After a week that's seen significant layoffs at Bungie, as well as reports of a delay for Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion, the studio has told players \"we know we have lost a lot of your trust\" and promised to reveal plans to \"take us all out of this Darkness and into the Light.\"\r\n\n\r\nReports of widespread layoffs at Bungie began circulating on Monday, and were later confirmed in statement from studio CEO Pete Parsons. Bloomberg later reported around 100 employees - approximately eight percent of Bungie's 1200-strong workforce - were affected by the job cuts, and that the layoffs followed internal warnings that studio revenue was 45 percent below projections due to a \"sharp drop\" in the popularity of Destiny 2.\r\n\n\r\nFurther reports have continued to paint a bleak picture of Destiny 2's fortunes; pre-orders for The Final Shape are said to be disappointing, while \"good\" rather than \"great\" feedback has reportedly lead management to delay the expansion from February to June next year.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Payday 3 hasn't exactly had the smoothest of launches; matchmaking issues, online-only requirements, and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system immediately soured its arrival for players back in September, and a highly anticipated first patch promising \"200+\" quality of life improvements has been repeatedly delayed. Finally though, after much waiting, the heist-shooter's 1.01 update is here on all platforms.\r\n\n\r\nPayday 3's 1.01 update was initially planned to launch on 5th October, but developer Starbreeze delayed its release to mid-October in order to \"ensure its stability\". After weeks of silence, the developer re-emerged to announced another, this time indefinite delay, explaining it had \"identified some issues that need to be fixed\".\r\n\n\r\nAs the wait has dragged on, Payday 3 player numbers have slumped to the low thousands, with the game's predecessor currently pulling in ten times more than the new version. As such, Starbreeze will doubtless be hoping the long-awaited arrival of 1.01 today will help reverse the game's fortunes. And it's a big one too, weighing in at 2GB (on PC, at least) and spanning an enormous number of improvements and changes.\r\n \nRead more",

It does look rather nice, I have to say.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile, as you will be - in the Sims team's words - closer than ever, this will mean bumping into neighbours left, right and centre.

Gameloft says it'll be building on this initial multiplayer offering over time.\r\n \nRead more",
