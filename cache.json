Modern democracy was invented in the mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies, it would look very different. Representation would look different. Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation would look different. Everything would look different, because we would have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to worry about...</p>",

It is a fairly standard marketing beat, with others such as Insomniac and Nintendo doing the same thing for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom respectively. But what Insomniac and Nintendo didn't have (or who they didn't have) was Succession's Brian Cox to talk us through the story so far. \r\n\n\r\nYes, the man that brought Logan Roy to life is here to tell us all about the Devil gene and more. \"Every single fight, no matter how big or small, has a story behind it,\" the Scottish actor states as dramatic music starts to pound in the background. \"There's one hell of a story to tell.\"\r\n\n\r\nWe then get told more about that aforementioned Devil gene, some cliff chucking exploits and the Tekken series' patricidal puzzle. You can have a watch for yourself below. I don't think it is meant to be funny, but it has made me chuckle.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 to get us up to speed on what has happened in the series so far. It is a fairly standard marketing beat, with others such as Insomniac and Nintendo doing the same thing for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom respectively. But what Insomniac and Nintendo didn't have (or who they didn't have) was Succession's Brian Cox to talk us through the story so far. \r\n\n\r\nYes, the man that brought Logan Roy to life is here to tell us all about the Devil gene and more. \"Every single fight, no matter how big or small, has a story behind it,\" the Scottish actor states as dramatic music starts to pound in the background. \"There's one hell of a story to tell.\"\r\n\n\r\nWe then get told more about that aforementioned Devil gene, some cliff chucking exploits and the Tekken series' patricidal puzzle. You can have a watch for yourself below. I don't think it is meant to be funny, but it has made me chuckle.\r\n \nRead more",

The Redditor recorded \"some naked camp time fun\", which they planned to share with their brother. Xbox then automatically uploaded the footage to its servers. \r\n\n\r\nHowever, if Xbox discovers imagery it deems offensive, the content is removed and the player's profile will be \"temporarily prohibited from sharing additional imagery (typically for 24 hours)\". And, as Daddy-Vegas' clips included that aforementioned nudity, they were met with a ban for each clip, which resulted in their account being suspended for a year. They have since appealed their ban, with the Redditor revealing earlier this week their efforts were successful.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A slide allegedly taken from a Sony presentation has revealed how many units some of the company's biggest first-party games have sold. \r\n\nThe slide – which notably excludes other Sony first-party titles, including Naughty Dog's The Last of Us series and Horizon Zero Dawn's sequel, Horizon Forbidden West – reveals the sale figures for several games released since 2017, including Marvel's Spider-Man (2018), God of War (2018), and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020), which have sold 18.9 million, 15.9 million, and 12.6 million copies in their first two years, respectively. \r\n\nThe same table, if true, also reveals that Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) sold 11 million copies, Gran Turismo Sport (2017) 7.8 million, Days Gone (2019) 7 million, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (2021) 3.9 million, and \"Ghost Dir Cut\" – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut (2021) – 3.3 million copies. \r\n \nRead more",

The GTA 6 hack contained a mountain of development assets, yes, but nothing playable in this manner. \r\n\n\r\nHere, people have been able to access a test build of Wolverine akin to an internal demo meant for Insomniac and Sony, that features multiple sections of the game available to play and explore. Naturally, these sections are still incomplete and unpolished, but key gameplay mechanics and story moments are included. \r\n \nRead more",

Since then, the team has wrapped up work on two final DLC drops introducing new characters, islands, and more - but it turns out that wasn't quite everything it had in store: in a surprise final update, Mimimi has now launched an expansive \"modding tool\" for PC.\r\n\n\r\nShadow Gambit launched back in August, and saw Mimimi revisiting its beloved stealth-tactics genre - which it'd already bought to life with impressive flair in Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperatdos 3 - with an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. The result, as I wrote in my four star review was a blend of \"raucous, high seas adventure and cerebral, slow-paced stealth\" that proved to be a \"joyous mastery of a very particular form\".\r\n\n\r\nShortly after its release, Mimimi announced Shadow Gambit would be the studio's last project, as its \"increasingly ambitious games\" had taken a \"heavy personal toll on us and our families\". Two final DLC releases for Shadow Gambit were to bring the studio's activities to a close, but it's now surprised fans with a \"very final parting gift\": an expansive \"modding tool\" designed to enable players to create their own custom mods.\r\n \nRead more",

And while this year's Game Awards failed to make the interminable wait any easier with a first trailer or some small morsel of news for fans, we might finally have something resembling a potential release window - courtesy of a retailer leak, by way of an official Bandai Namco partner, pointing to a February 2024 launch for the DLC.\r\n\n\r\nAs spotted over on Reddit, details of a new Elden Ring collaboration between publisher Bandai Namco and peripheral manufacturer Thrustmaster - one that'll apparently see the latter release a series of limited edition controllers themed around the game - were today shared, briefly and presumably mistakenly, by online retailer Datablitz.\r\n\n\r\nNotably, the accompanying promotional material revealed the first batch of controllers would arrive in February next year to \"sync with the new Shadow of the Erdtree expansion release\". It's a launch window that seems highly unlikely at first glance, not least because it's barely two months from now with no peep of marketing from Bandai Namco - but on the other hand, who's to say that if I wish for something hard enough I can't make it happen? Plus, a surprise second anniversary launch would be in keeping with the amusingly understated way the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was announced in the first place.\r\n \nRead more",
