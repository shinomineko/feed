In the evaluation process, a numeric score between 0 and 10 is calculated, 10 being the most severe (critical) value. The goal of CVSS is to provide comparable scores across different evaluators. However, previous works indicate that CVSS might not reach this goal: If a vulnerability is evaluated by several analysts, their scores often differ. This raises the following questions: Are CVSS evaluations consistent? Which factors influence CVSS assessments? We systematically investigate these questions in an online survey with 196 CVSS users. We show that specific CVSS metrics are inconsistently evaluated for widespread vulnerability types, including Top 3 vulnerabilities from the &#8221;2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses&#8221; list. In a follow-up survey with 59 participants, we found that for the same vulnerabilities from the main study, 68% of these users gave different severity ratings. Our study reveals that most evaluators are aware of the problematic aspects of CVSS, but they still see CVSS as a useful tool for vulnerability assessment. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for inconsistent evaluations and provide recommendations on improving the consistency of scoring...</p></blockquote>",

This was not because he had just used his web-tastic athleticism to save a school bus of children from careering off the side of the road, or swept MJ off her feet (literally) before kissing her while upside down. \r\n\n\r\nRather, he was a topic of conversation because Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games remastered its original 2018 game for the PlayStation 5, and at the same time changed up the look of its unmasked hero, Peter Parker. \r\n\n\r\nWhile Insomniac said this new model was a better reflection of actor Yuri Lowenthal's facial capture, it caused a certain amount of upset for fans of the original. In fact, when the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man released last year, mods were made to bring Peter Parker's original face back into the game. But, perhaps we should all be less concerned about the two different facial models for Peter and move on. After all, that's what his actor wants. In fact, he just wants people to \"get over it\".\r\n \nRead more",

Needless to say, I am more than a little bit excited.\r\n\n\r\nTo accompany this announcement, a small teaser was also released. It is short and suitably charming, showing a young person humming as she sits at a table strewn with flora and art supplies. There are also modern bits and pieces, such as headphones. She is painting in a book, and while I have nothing to base this on other than my hunch, she looks to be painting herself as a hobbit.

The archer, meanwhile, is better suited to taking down enemies - which are said to be behave organically out the world - from a distance using their bow and arrow, which can support the likes of exploding and blighting arrows.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Shadows of Doubt, the ambitious procedural detective noir sandbox from developer Cole Jefferies, is introducing new cases themed around infidelity on 25th September, as part of its first major update since entering Steam early access in April.\r\n\n\r\nShadows of Doubt, for those in need of a quick refresher, is a first-person, open-world detective sim set in a noirish sci-fi city. Its unique selling point, however, is that procedural generation governs virtually every aspect of it in a bid to create an endlessly replayable crime-solving caper - from the layout of its city streets to the schedules of its citizens, right through to the cases you'll need to solve through stealth, subtrefuge, and sleuthing.\r\n\n\r\nAnd from next Monday, 25th September, come the arrival of its Cheats and Liars update, Shadows of Doubt will have another trick in its toolbox - as players might just find themselves asked to investigate cases of infidelity, should it suit the procedural generation's whims.\r\n \nRead more",

It’s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.\"\r\n\nWondering why Willingham has done this? You're not alone. The author said he's made the decision to move everything into the public domain for \"a number of reasons\", including \"practicality\" – Willingham feels much has changed since he first signed his contract with DC Comics – and \"philosophy\", as his \"thoughts on how to reform the trademark and copyright laws in this country (and others, I suppose) have undergone something of a radical transformation\".\r\n \nRead more",

But these in-game items are fairly unhelpful in the grand scheme of getting and building characters, especially when compared to its battle pass, the \"Nameless Honor\", which upgrades its free track to premium for £9.99 and offers far more helpful materials and weapons.\r\n \nRead more",

To help Peter and Miles swing across the larger map, they can now use web wings to traverse faster. The game uses a new fast travel system which is unlocked through the district progress systesm, and Insomniac says players will experience \"very little downtime\" when using fast travel.\nThe HUD for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 looks more organic, as markers for activities and quests players have already discovered will appear across New York City. This is explained in-game as AR technology in the lenses of the Spider-Masks which, given the technology already used by characters in the Spider-Man universe, Peter and Miles probably sorely need. \n Read more",

It also brings changes to loot, items, and crafting, as well as UI and UX improvements, and a new selection of radio stations.\r\n\n\r\nIn other words, Cyberpunk's 2.0 update touches on a broad range of core systems in a significant fashion - and CD Projekt has been attempting to explain how these changes will impact the experience across a recent series of developer streams.\r\n \nRead more",

Oh, and there was also some news on The Sims 4's first Stuff Pack in over two-and-a-half years.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, though, Project Rene and the news it'll definitely be free-to-play - or as EA is more insistently phrasing it, \"free-to-download\". Either way, the important thing here is that no core game purchase will be required, and EA is also keen to add there'll be no subscription and no \"energy mechanics\" - so that's at least one predatory mobile monetisation tactic off the table.\r\n\n\r\nAs to what a new mainline Sims game designed from the ground-up to be free-to-play might look like, a Project Rene job listing hastily removed from EA's website earlier this year pointed to an in-game marketplace featuring official and user-generated content (both free and paid) - something else EA has now more or less confirmed.\r\n \nRead more",

Its specs are broadly similar to the standard model (the £1,199 Pro Max even has the 6.7\" screen), but it switches in a 10x optical \"telephoto\" camera zoom, titanium body, and the A17 Pro chip with 6-core GPU.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Unity has announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model which will see it introduce a monthly fee per new game install beginning on 1st January next year - a move that has drawn considerable criticism from the development community.\r\n\n\r\nUnity - the engine behind countless acclaimed games including Tunic, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Citizen Sleeper, RimWorld, Outer Wilds, Fall Guys, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Cities: Skylines - was previously licenced to developers using a royalty free model built around subscription tiers. Anyone whose revenue or funding was less than $100k over the course of the year (and who didn't want access to features such as the ability to remove the Unity splash screen) could stick to the free Unity Personal licence, while a Unity Plus subscription was required up to $200k in revenue, and a Unity Pro or above subscription was needed for more.\r\n\n\r\nAs of 1st January, 2024, however, developers will be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install - seemingly including re-installs and installs across multiple devices - on top of their existing licence subscription, with those fees kicking in for titles that have made $200k or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200k lifetime game installs. Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers, meanwhile, will see the fees applied after passing the $1m revenue and 1m lifetime installs threshold.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, guess what? Anything is possible in this darkest of timelines.\r\n\n\r\nThe official Xbox credit card will soon be a thing, albeit only in the US for the time being, having been conjured into existence through a partnership between Microsoft and Mastercard. It'll initially be available exclusively to Xbox Insiders (it's expected to expand to all US-based Xbox players starting next year) and offers one of those reward-based scheme things, which - and I'm not sure there's a nicer way of putting this - essentially incentivises people to increase their debt, so, you know, please use responsibly and all that.\r\n\n\r\nBasically, everyday purchases made on the card will steadily accrue points that can be spent on games and add-ons via Xbox.com, but an initial purchase using the card will also reward cardholders with 5,000 points (equating to $50 USD), plus three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Only new members are eligible for that three-month deal, incidentally, but it can be gifted to other people if you're already a Game Pass subscriber yourself.\r\n \nRead more",

Wikipedia also tells me the well-received game was originally planned to release on Super Nintendo, before getting the chop.\r\n\n\r\nAnyway, 28 years later, Gargoyles the game is returning in the form of Gargoyles Remastered, by Empty Clip Studios, featuring the ability to toggle between the original's wonderfully characterful 16-bit visuals and a new art style said to be inspired by the cartoon, but which, to my eyes at least, doesn't look to have anywhere near the same kind of charm.\r\n \nRead more",

Some of that takes the form of a brief - and by brief I mean barely five-seconds-long - in-game look at Van Damme, who appears around the 5:52 mark.

Well, we can now sling those reports onto the 'correct' pile; testing for the tech giant new feature is officially underway.\r\n\n\r\nThe gist of Google's new initiative, known as Playables, is that it'll enable users to instantly play online games via YouTube's website or iOS and Android apps - and now, as confirmed on its YouTube test features and experiments list (thanks 9to5google) testing is now live.\r\n\n\r\n\"Playables are games that can be played directly on YouTube on both desktop and mobile devices,\" the company explains. \"If you're part of this experiment, you'll see a section on YouTube called 'Playables' that will appear alongside other content on the home feed.\"\r\n \nRead more",

The new hardware from the Big N now feels closer than ever - but when exactly will it arrive?\r\n\nMore importantly, perhaps - for any Nintendo console - is what Nintendo game will it launch alongside? Will Switch 2's beefier specs be a smart time to finally launch Metroid Prime 4? Or does Nintendo go with the more mass market approach, and tap up its 3D Mario team? \nFinally, since it's out and it's probably going to be the biggest game of the year, we discuss the opening moments of Starfield - beyond the hour we all spend in the character creator. Joining me this week to share their thoughts on all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.\n Read more",

At time of writing, the speedrunning record for getting Pikmin 4's true ending is just under two and a half hours, but it doesn't take advantage of any area skips - it's an exercise in Dandori mastery because there aren't really any major glitches to take advantage of to begin with. \n Read more",

The aforementioned \"potato mode\" is, alas, unlikely to fulfil all your wildest, possibily erotic potato-slaying fantasies, more likely being some under-the-hood changes Gunfire has made to push Remnant 2's settings below those previously allowed - hopefully meaning improved performance on lower-spec PCs.\r\n\n\r\nPerformance improvements have, of course, been a focus for Gunfire following Remnant 2's slightly wobbly launch, and Cureton's post makes it explicitly clear the incoming patch will include more. That comes alongside the introduction of toggle aim and hold sprint, \"dozens\" of enemy updates, material refund changes for weapon deconstruction, PlayStation icon selection, and proper EXP rewards for instances where Summons make the kills.\r\n \nRead more",

There'd been some concern in the community, you might recall, that Minthara had been a victim of last-minute content cuts to meet Baldur's Gate 3's shifted deadline - but Larian had instead blamed her silence on a bug, promising an imminent fix, which, now here, should hopefully reinstate all missing Minthara content.\r\n\n\r\n\"This hotfix takes care of a bug that blocked access to some of Minthara’s lines of dialogue, including some hot takes from your companions about your decision to date the ruthless Oath of Vengeance Paladin,\" Larian explains in today's release notes. \"If approval is high enough, your romance with Minthara will progress in Act 3. This unlocks several new dialogues allowing you to explore and deepen the relationship, and discover more details of Minthara's backstory. Alongside many lines of interactive dialogue, many more non-interactive voiced lines are available with Minthara as a romantic partner.\"\r\n \nRead more",

No it's not because the inhabitants of the world have faulty necks - it's because developer Larian is doing something sneaky.\nYou see, offering people the ability to speak with any corpse via the spell Speak with Dead created a lot of work. It meant writers not only had to write lines for all the living people, but for the dead ones too. And okay, there's a limiting factor in how Speak with Dead only allows you to ask five questions, but that's still an array of questions to write answers for. And in a war-torn world filled with dead people... That's a lot of answers to write.\nWhat to do? Simple, albeit gruesome: cut their heads off. \"The trick that we use is [you can speak to] 'any dead that still has their head',\" Vincke told Wizards of the Coast interviewer Todd Kenreck, in a really lovely interview actually. \"So you will see a lot of decapitated people in the game - that's literally how we solved that.\"\n Read more",

That's nearly 16m more murder plots than wedding celebrations, which currently sit at 34,480,042. And, of course, more than a few chaotic sorts have thoroughly muddied the waters between the two, with Paradox reporting a total of 7,790 bloody weddings have been msaterminded by players who cleary weren't going to let a bit of murder get in the way of anyone's big day - or possiby vice versa.\r\n\n\r\nParadox's other shared stats don't open up quite such a fascinating window on player behaviour, but we do know 1,325,198 grand tournaments have been bravely fought since launch, and 1,037,787 grand weddings have also been held. In total, player have amassed more than 317m hours in-game, with nearly 1.4m players having joined this year alone.\r\n \nRead more",

This term was coined by the development team to describe \"a sci-fi universe that's a little more grounded and relatable\". Essentially, Bethesda wants its game to have a sense of realism meets grit, and it is doing this by combining the practicality of real-life space technology with the aesthetics of Punk culture. \r\n\n\r\nNow, this design decision has got the European Space Agency's approval, with its head of branding and partnerships Emmet Fletcher telling me he believes Starfield's NASA-Punk aesthetic \"humanises\" the game.\r\n\n\r\n\"This is the aesthetic where you basically have worn and loved futuretech? Actually, if you look at some of the things we have, it's a little bit like that already,\" he told me from his office in Paris earlier this week. \"We have things that if it works, it carries on working. And there's no need to change it. It's about reliability, and if it's reliable, it carries on.\"\r\n \nRead more",

The happier news, though, is that publisher 2K is offering a range of discounts, starting with a far more affordable $59.99 limited-time launch price. Additionally, 2K has announced a number of upgrade paths for existing Borderlands players, making the cost of entry more manageable still.\r\n \nRead more",

Did you know that you can initiate combat during an interaction cut-scene to affect the outcome of it? It means you can potentially save a character scripted to be attacked - and maybe killed - during the cut-scene before it actually happens. \nThe tip comes from content creator ESO Danny. As the video points out, you can interrupt a cut-scene by selecting the \"Attack\" circular button/option in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.\n Read more",

That whole fanciful framing device is, of course, secondary to the real business at hand: solving 'picture logic puzzles' that feature horizontal and vertical rows of numbers used as hints to place dots on a grid and form illustrations.\r\n\n\r\nIf that sounds familiar, it's because Logiart Grimoire is essentially Picross in all but name (Nintendo owns the 'Picross' title, while Jupiter owns its systems), albeit with an added magic twist hooking into a new \"fusion\" system that challenges players to figure out how to combine materials gained through solving puzzles to unlock new ones.\r\n \nRead more",

In practice, it's you against another player online aiming to take control of a hex board using three champions who auto-battle in real time. You strategically manoeuvre your characters across the board to destroy your opponent's tower. It looks a bit like holochess in Star Wars, but with woodland creatures instead of aliens.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your mind back to the halcyon days of July 2022 (PowerWash Simulator came out, it was fab) and you might recall developer Digital Extremes unveiling its first new property since Warframe's release back in 2013: a free-to-play fantasy action-MMORPG going by the name Soulframe. One and a bit years later, and the studio is finally ready to give it a proper showing, airing 30 minutes of gameplay during its TennoCon 2023 fan convention this weekend.\r\n\n\r\nSoulframe's development is being lead by former Warframe creative director Geoff Crookes (Rebecca Ford has taken over the role on Warframe, driving the sci-fi shooter in a wonderfully bonkers new direction over the last few years) and takes players to a world that, as was explained during its initial reveal, is \"a little angry about what's been done to it\". This causes the earth to shift throughout the day, giving Digital Extremes the lore excuse it needs to introduce some of its beloved procedural dungeons, here found deep underground.\r\n\n\r\nThese dungeons do eventually put in an appearance during Soulframe's 30-minute gameplay reveal, but first we get a more thorough glimpse of how Soulframe's action plays out. The title has been described as a \"mirror universe\" to Warframe, meaning that while some element will be familiar to fans of the free-to-play sci-fi shooter - those procedural dungeons, for instance - a lot is very different, with slow-paced melee combat in a fantasy setting being the vibe here.\r\n \nRead more",

Blizzard says these changes are aimed at the player having \"less time being Crowd Controlled and receiving more recovery time after being Crowd Controlled, especially at higher World Tiers\".\r\n\nFrom 29th August onwards, Cold Enchanted Elites that attack in quick succession, such as Ghost Archers and Snake Brutes, will\" no longer proc the Cold Enchanted on every hit\", and Chilling Wind will \"spawn overlapping walls less often\".\r\n \nRead more",
