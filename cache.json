Become the New McKinsey?&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you&#8217;ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans­&#8212;one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn&#8217;t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has...</p></blockquote>",

Suspicions were triggered when the department detected unusual traffic emanating from one of its servers that was running a trial version of the Orion software suite made by SolarWinds, according to sources familiar with the incident. The software, used by system administrators to manage and configure networks, was communicating externally with an unfamiliar system on the internet. The DOJ asked the security firm Mandiant to help determine whether the server had been hacked. It also engaged Microsoft, though it’s not clear why the software maker was also brought onto the investigation...</p></blockquote>",

Organizations building or deploying AI models should incorporate AI concerns into their cybersecurity functions using a risk management framework that addresses security throughout the AI system life cycle.

It is now afternoon, and there's still no sign of it. To save myself from twiddling my thumbs while staring mindlessly at the wall, I decided to check out Flappy Souls.\r\n\nFlappy Souls is a new, free release on Steam. It is marketed as being \"a mix of Flappy Bird and Dark Souls\", hence the name. The premise is remarkably simple - you have to fly around as a baseball cap-wearing bird while dodging obstacles. Smattered through these obstacles are souls that you have to collect, and as you progress you level up. And that's it. Easy, right? No, not right. This game is HARD! \r\n\n\r\nNow, before I get too into it, let me ask - are you the kind of person who ducks a little when you go under a low bridge in a car? I am. For some reason, I have it hardwired into my brain that physically ducking will somehow ensure safer passage. Logically, of course, I know it makes absolutely no sense. If my car isn't going to fit, me ducking, or breathing in when I pass another vehicle on a slightly narrower stretch of road, isn't going to change that. And yet, I still do it. \r\n \nRead more",

Animated versions of Black and Kyle Gass begin the promo in a fairly normal way. The duo are in a studio, with Black singing into his mic while Gass strums on his animated guitar. Soon, however, things become chaoticly brilliant.\r\n\n\r\nIt starts with Gass getting squashed by God of War's Dauði Kaupmaðr, and Black fleeing the scene only to find himself in the middle of Fallout 4 (as one does). The rest of the video then sees the duo becoming Sonic and Tails, Red Dead cowboys and more. As I have said, it is brilliant, as you can see for yourself below. \r\n \nRead more",

After a brief time of being available in US comic book stores, the entire thing is now online for free. \r\n\n\r\nI have had a read of the comic myself, and it is a nice, pretty condensed, standalone story that should help fill some of the void between now and Marvel's Spider-Man 2's eventual debut (don't worry, I am not going to spoil anything here). If you are interested in having a read of what Peter Parker and co. have been getting up to ahead of Marvel's Spider-Man 2's release, you can check out the online version of the comic here. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "First-person shooter Mouse has gathered quite the excitement in the last 24 hours, thanks to its... distinct art style and protagonist.\r\n\n\r\nThe game will see you play as John Mouston, a private detective sniffing out corruption and rogue rodents. Inspired by rubber hose animation, John Mouston bears some resemblance to Walt Disney's beloved Mickey Mouse. Indeed, he has the long snout(is that correct terminology?) with a round nose, the big ears and the white gloves. But he also has a revolver and cigars, so he's definitely not Mickey Mouse.\r\n\n\r\nThe gameplay we've seen so far gives me Doom vibes, whilst the vending machines remind me a lot of BioShock. I'd be lying if I said it doesn't look fun to play.\r\n \nRead more",

But alas, these new found tactics and moves do not work in the real world, and Ramsey does not pass her driving test. \"You were doing 80 in a 30,\" her driving instructor explains.

But that really is about it in terms of gameplay analysis. \r\n\n\r\nThen I watched it again, and this time my mind was drawn not to Link gadabouting through the sky, but to the real life, \"everyday\" man the advert actually focuses on. It is quite clear what (or who) Nintendo is trying to paint a picture of here. \r\n \nRead more",

EA has also updated its PC streaming budgets, something the developer says will help alleviate traversal hitching. The team has also implemented general performance improvements for \"some VFX\" (this update will also be coming \"soon\" to console versions of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor). Lastly on the PC specific updates (for today, at least), EA has updated the data handling when toggling raytracing, improving non-raytraced performance.\r\n \nRead more",

Only, should all four characters die, the town will reassert itself, reconfiguring its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.\r\n \nRead more",

It is Arkane's worst-reviewed game, and has a \"mostly negative\" user review rating on Steam.\r\n\n\r\nThe failure of Redfall has also brought into question Microsoft's ability to launch high-quality games with any regularity after a string of high-profile flops, and has caused some to cancel their Game Pass subscription between now and the upcoming launch of Bethesda's Starfield in September.\r\n \nRead more",

Developed by Viridis Corporation, it was published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i back in 1996. \r\n\n\r\nDespite featuring a playable Zelda (in Zelda's Adventure, it is Link who has been whisked away by Ganon), the game was pretty poorly received by, well, everyone.

The consensus is the tease relates to Kronika's Hourglass.

After a tragedy, Ballistic retired and disappeared from public view. Until now, that is, with Ballistic back and ready to show the younger generation of Legends just how it's done.\nBallistic's abilities are well suited to both ranged and close quarters combat in any mode you choose to play. However, he truly shines at singling out a target and taking them out in a stylish manner. His passive 'The Sling' allows him to carry a third weapon but only with its base statistics. This means no attachments or upgrades, if you put a purple tier weapon in, it will instantly become its base tier. His tactical 'Whistler' can overheat enemy weapons, and his ultimate 'Tempest' buffs not only him but his entire team with infinite ammunition for a period of time. \n Read more",

We don't get to see much of that in today's teaser, but there is a vaguely amusing musical bait-and-switch, a bit of aerial footage, and thankfully - given the video game series' vehicular combat roots - at least one shot of a car with some guns stuck to the front.\r\n \nRead more",

It lets you take down notes about your game, and comes with \"rich text formatting, the ability to have multiple notes per game, and can even be used in offline mode\". Your notes will be saved per game, and are then synced to other PCs that you are logged into.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we discuss the fallout from today's dramatic decision by the UK to block Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal, and whether an appeal could still turn things around. \r\n\nWith the UK regulator issuing a stern warning over how it sees the deal impacting competitiveness among cloud gaming companies, it remains to be seen how much more Microsoft could do to reassure the UK without structurally changing the deal. Or does, perhaps, Microsoft say the UK should not have given up on this so easily, by saying a block on the deal was simply the most straightforward option?\nSo, do we think an appeal could still succeed? And what will it take? Joining me to share their thoughts are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy. \n Read more",

Luckily, help is on the way, with Picross S9 officially launching tomorrow, 27th April.\r\n\n\r\nThis ninth mainline series entry on Switch introduces a grand total of 485 new puzzles, so plenty of fresh deductive, dot-plopping column action to be getting on with. 300 of those are Picross and Mega Picross puzzles, 150 are Clip Picross, 30 are Colour Picross, and the remaining five are Extra puzzles - three of which will require you to link play data from Picross S6, S7, and S8.\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, the local co-op mode introduced in Picross' previous instalment makes a return in S9, meaning up to four players can work together to solve its new conundrums.\r\n \nRead more",

Obsidian has also optimised and tuned Grounded's default graphics settings on Steam Deck for a more \"enjoyable experience\".\r\n\n\r\nElsewhere, Grounded's 1.2 update introduces new foes in the form of wasps, which can be found guarding their mini-hives around the yard or situated in more challenging Wasp Nests, where players can also encounter the new Wasp Queen boss. Defeating Grounded's latest enemies will unlock new items to craft, including armour.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "After its initial reveal on April 1st this year, Asus is finally ready to shed more light on its ROG Ally handheld gaming PC, which launches on May 11th and will be sold by Currys in the UK. The Steam Deck competitor looks to be a more premium device than Valve's offering, with a faster AMD Ryzen Z1 series processor, seven-inch 1080p 120Hz touch screen and Windows 11 - but no price has yet been announced. \nThe hardware side of the equation is perhaps the most fascinating, so let's begin there. The Ally is powered by a 'custom' Ryzen Z1 chipset that includes Zen 4 CPU cores and RDNA 3 graphics produced on a 4nm node. (By comparison, current Ryzen 7000 desktop designs use a mixture of 5nm and 6nm processes, which should give the Ally's APU an advantage in terms of performance per watt.) We expect to see configurations of the device featuring the Z1 (6C/12T, 22MB cache, 2.8TF 4CU GPU) and Z1 Extreme (8C/16T, 24MB cache, 8.6TF 12CU GPU) processors announced by AMD earlier today, offering increasing levels of horsepower for a higher asking price. \nSpeaking of which, the impressive-looking APU is backed with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM in dual-channel mode, while storage is up to a 512GB PCIe 4.0 SSD and UHS-2 Micro SD card expansion - faster than what is available on the Deck, which is limited to PCIe 3.0 storage and UHS-1 Micro SD cards. Wi-Fi 6E is also included, in comparison to WiFi 5 on Steam Deck. It'll be interesting to see whether all SKUs of the Ally come with the full complement of RAM and storage, or whether this will be pared back on the cheaper options. \n Read more",

Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees.\r\n\n\r\nThe following year, California's Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. However, Gonzalez-Rogers did side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers linking out to alternative payment methods from within apps - a practice known as \"anti-steering\" - as that would constitute \"anti-competitive conduct\" under state law.\r\n \nRead more",

Here, we meet him taking a lonely stroll through his lavish mansion before settling down for a recap of his Thunderdome career, which ended tragically with the death of his teammate and brother-in-law.\r\n\n\r\nSince then, Ballistic has become a recluse, neglecting his family until they chose to leave. Which is where Respawn's cinematic switches back to the present, and when we - and Ballistic - learn his son, Nathaniel, has just qualified for the Apex Games.\r\n \nRead more",

When you're not absorbing the sights of 1980s Tokyo or hearing ancient folk tales, Paranormasight feeds you bits of information about Japan during the wider Shōwa era and the earlier Edo period.\r\n\n\r\nWhether from decades or centuries ago, elements of Japanese history are woven into the game, something which Paranormasight director and writer Takaya Ishiyama told me more about, in a discussion which revealed more about the team's approach to using history in the game's narrative as a way to balance realism and mystery.\r\n\n\r\nOne of the first things you notice when playing Paranormasight is the difference in visual style between the environments and the characters. The game's cast were drawn by Kobayashi Gen, and his distinct style stands out from the surroundings in-game. The 360-degree panoramas you explore were all created from photographs, though this wasn't initially what the team set out to do.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A French court has sided with Nintendo in an appeal launched by filehosting website operator Dstorarge, which was previously ordered to pay €935,500 (around £826k) after it refused to withdraw access to pirated Nintendo games.\r\n\n\r\nNintendo initially took legal action against Dstorarge after it ignored copyright notifications demanding it remove illegal copies of Nintendo games hosted on its 1fichier service. The Judicial Court of Paris ultimately ruled in Nintendo's favour, saying filehosting services such as 1fichier were responsible for blocking access to pirated content and ordering Dstorage pay the Mario maker €935,500 in damages.\r\n\n\r\nDstorage, in turn, launched an appeal against the ruling, and, two years on, that appeal has now failed. The Paris Court of Appeals has once again sided with Nintendo, ordering Dstorage to pay the company €442,750 (£391k) in compensation, plus €25,000 (£22k) to cover legal fees.\r\n \nRead more",

And wherever a dungeon has an objective, especially one you have to carry around, there are now movement speed buffs as well as other enhancements to keep the pace up.\n Read more",
