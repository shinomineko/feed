Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system ...</p></blockquote>",

And that we don’t have any unique interests to perturb our thinking. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government mid-eighteenth century politicians technology could invent. The twenty-first century is a very different place technically, scientifically, and philosophically. What could democracy look like if it were reinvented today?

Architectural decoupling entails splitting functionality for different fundamental actions in a system, such as decoupling authentication (proving who is allowed to use the network) from connectivity (establishing session state for communicating). Institutional decoupling entails splitting what information remains between non-colluding entities, such as distinct companies or network operators, or between a user and network peers. This decoupling makes service providers individually breach-proof, as they each have little or no sensitive data that can be lost to hackers. Put simply, the Decoupling Principle suggests always separating who you are from what you do...</p></blockquote>",

Here's what you need to know.\nFirst, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti. This is the renamed, repriced and now relaunched version of the RTX 4080 12GB that was so roundly derided upon its announcement that Nvidia 'unlaunched' the card soon thereafter. The key to that move was a feeling of confusion from gamers and press alike that the card was too distant in price and performance from the 4080 16GB, as it wasn't even based on the same AD103 chip. \nNow, the GPU seems more sensibly positioned - as a small improvement over the popular last-gen RTX 3080, with a price to match of $799. With DLSS 3 frame generation, it can be up to three times faster than the RTX 3090 Ti while consuming nearly half the power, although we look forward to putting those claims to the test. The latest Ada Lovelace card is scheduled to launch on January 5th, so we don't have too long to wait!  \n Read more",

In the filing, Microsoft defends its position by turning the spotlight back onto Sony, detailing a handful of \"prominent\" games the company alleges have been barred from release on Xbox.\r\n\nWhilst the filing acknowledges that \"exclusivity strategies are not uncommon in the games industry\", Microsoft seems to take issue with Sony's partnerships with third-party publishers, namely From Software, Square Enix, and Konami.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "EA has used its FIFA series to correctly predict the winner of the World Cup for fourth consecutive time. \r\n\n\r\nThe entire tournament was simulated inside FIFA 23, which outputted Argentina as the ultimate winners, with Lionel Messi winning the Golden Boot and Emi Martínez winning the Golden Glove awards. The predictions were published November 8th, long before the tournament had started. \r\n\n\r\nThe game's ability to predict the winner for the fourth time in a row is a testament to the accuracy of FIFA's official rankings, but of course the uncertainty of the real world means that not everything was predicted correctly. \r\n \nRead more",

Co-op was then said to have been revived for Horizon Forbidden West, potentially as a separate mode, but again didn't make the final cut.\r\n\n\r\nAs confirmed by Guerilla's recruitment-focused Twitter feed, however, the studio's co-op dreams are still very much alive, with the company currently hiring for an internally developed \"separate online project\" in the Horizon universe. This will feature a \"new cast of characters and a unique stylised look\", and allow friends to \"explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Hideo Kojima's idiosyncratic post-apocalyptic courier adventure Death Stranding is the latest in an increasingly long line of video games to get the movie treatment, courtesy of a newly announced collaboration between Kojima Productions and Barbarian executive producer Alex Lebovici's Hammerstone Studios.\r\n\n\r\nDeath Stranding, for those unfamiliar, stars The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier trying to make ends meet in an aggressively wet corner of rural Wales. One day, his clothes unexpectedly fall off, a baby turns into goo, ...fish?! Then, walking!!!!\r\n\n\r\nOkay, so that's not exactly how it goes (although it's not not, either) but it's fair to say Death Stranding's atmospheric tale of a post-apocalyptic United States - which, yes, does look at awful lot like Wales - is not short of wonderfully outlandish ideas. There are eerily invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, a mysterious plane of existence known as the Beach, and much, much more.\r\n \nRead more",

And the not particularly specific announcement may have something to do with the fact the \"fall 2023\" release was leaked earlier this week after a writer on the project added the date (since removed) to their online CV.\r\n\n\r\nOfficial confirmation, however, has now arrived courtesy of a new post to the PlayStation Blog. \"What a year it's been for PlayStation Studios,\" Spider-Man 2 creative director Bryan Intihar wrote as part of the news, \"here at Insomniac Games we’ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers. Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022...and here’s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.”\r\n \nRead more",

But in a lovely moment at the start of this year, they each received a surprise re-release. \"It's always been a secret shame of ours that the success of No Man's Sky left Joe Danger unloved,\" Hello Games' Sean Murray explained at the time. \"For the last two years we've had a hobby project of bringing Joe Danger back to life. Slowly rebuilding it piece by piece through eight years of Unity changes.\"\r\n \nRead more",

This news was, for many of us, a very welcome surprise. \r\n\n\r\nHowever, Hungarian digital artist Zsolt Kosa actually envisioned this collaboration much, much, earlier. Perhaps, even before developer CD Projekt Red did. \r\n\n\r\nTwo years ago, Kosa shared two mocked up posters of Elba in Cyberpunk 2077 to his ArtStation page. The first of these shows Elba with ice blue cyber-eyes and an impressively collared coat (as shown in this article's header image). The second shows him with some rather fancy looking sunglasses, and that same very fetching coat. \r\n \nRead more",

Even with all these precautions in place, you may still not be safe from Valheim's new enemies. With the introduction of the Mistlands update comes a new type of raid - and this one is wreaking havoc on established player bases. Rather devastatingly, some players are losing homes that took them hundreds of hours to make. \r\n\n\r\nThe new event, called \"they sought you out\", unleashes hordes of insects on your player base - and worse still, they can fly. Seekers and seeker soldiers are capable of hopping over ditches, then mulching stone walls like they're made of papier maché. The event can occur at any time after you've defeated the Plains boss Yagluth, so anyone who has completed Valheim's biomes is vulnerable to these attacks. And sure enough, it's taking a lot of players by surprise. \r\n\n\r\n\"When we got raided we got caught off-guard and lost our three-story base which took us hundreds of hours,\" said one Reddit user. \"It was protected with walls, trenches, and most upgraded gates - it didn't slow the seekers down at all...

However, it has now been given a colourful little update by Activision. So, yes, we will be able to see you now. \nAs Ishraq reported earlier this month, this skin by LA Thieves was labelled  \"Roze 2.0\", which is a reference to the Roze skin that was released for the original Warzone and Modern Warfare back in 2019. This skin was notoriously famous for making its wearer hard to see. In fact, following its release, Raven Software was forced to edit the skin to make it easier for other players to see the elusive Roze skin wearers.\r\n \nRead more",

While The Game Awards 2022 dominated the news, Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover faced a major setback with the FTC and Diablo 4's big release date announcement was superseded by serious claims of mismanagement and crunch.  \r\n\nThe awards ceremony was an eventful affair, even without its climactic and rather concerning stage invasion. The typical array of trailers for games like Final Fantasy 16, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor and Street Fighter 6 came thick and fast, alongside big announcements for things such as Death Stranding 2, Hades 2, Horizon Forbidden West PS5-only DLC and Armored Core 6. \nDid Geoff Keighley keep his pledge to make this year's ceremony speedier? Not really. Somewhere, Christopher Judge is now on the second day of his acceptance speech. So, here for you today is a recap of everything we thought was really worth your time - and what we think Death Stranding 2 should actually be titled.

Tekken time logic, I guess.\r\n\n\r\nThe trailer below focuses on the Tekken 8 story (Tekken has an actual real life Guinness World Record for being the longest-running video game storyline!). Once again the Mishimas are at each other's throats, with Tekken 8 picking up where Tekken 7 left off and the war between father and son Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama heating up. When all appears lost, Jin looks up and sees his mother's dramatic return. I doubt there's much interest in a family selfie.\r\n \nRead more",

Mark it in your calendars and take the whole month off. Say Eurogamer said it was okay.\nThe August 2023 release date means Baldur's Gate 3 arrives, in full, just shy of three years after it first appeared in Steam Early Access, in October 2022. A lot has happened there of course - a lot of tweaking and tuning and honing the experience of the game. Its popularity allowed Larian to breathe and make BG3 a bigger, better thing.\nJust for giggles: the August 2023 date also means BG3 arrives 23 years after BG2, and 25 years after the original Baldur's Gate. I imagine you're probably not laughing if you remember those.\n Read more",

Colleagues claim, for instance, McCree \"would grow intrigued by different aspects of the game and then lose interest and hand it off to other people without finishing what he started.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Delightful VR fantasy adventure Moss and its sequel have been confirmed as PSVR2 launch titles, with both games arriving alongside Sony's new hardware on 22nd February next year.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Moss, if you're unfamiliar, initially launched as a PSVR exclusive back in 2018, gaining widespread acclaim for its charming tale of a tiny mouse, Quill, on a journey through a beautiful, human-sized fantasy world. Eurogamer called it \"the finest PSVR game to date\".\r\n\n\r\nIts best trick was its hybrid first-person/-third-person perspective, giving players full control over Quill while simultaneously letting them view the action through the eyes of a spirit, able to interact with the environment to solve puzzles and help Quill on her journey.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your mind back to the early 90s and you may recall two aliens with a love for funk music crash landing on earth. These aliens were ToeJam and Earl, and their initial crash landing here (all via the Sega Mega Drive) resulted in their names being elevated to somewhat of a cult status in the industry. \r\n\n\r\nNow, over 30 years since their first landing, ToeJam and Earl will soon be coming to a new medium. Yes, these two aliens will be joining the likes of Lara Croft, Nathan Drake and Mario, who have all made the transition to the big screen. \r\n\n\r\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, a new feature film from Amazon based on ToeJam and Earl's video game escapades will be heading our way sometime in the future. This upcoming project will be written by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo, whose previous work includes Hotel Transylvania 4. Meanwhile, basketball player Stephen Curry will also be producing the project through his production company Unanimous Media.\r\n \nRead more",

And yes, that means competitions can now be entirely item-free.\r\n\n\r\nThat's not quite the end of it, either; in Team Races and Battles, it's even possible to allocate items to specific teams, meaning you can really pile on the pressure - perhaps all spiny shells against an increasingly sweaty palmed team armed with nothing but hooters?\r\n \nRead more",
