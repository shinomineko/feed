There's also new kart elements, with 'Super Yoshi' and 'Yoshi Horn' up for grabs. \nMario Kart Live Home Circuit was the work of Velan Studios, who've gone on to find further success with this year's Knockout City. Home Circuit wasn't without its limitations, but it was still a fascinating and frequently charming thing.  \"A neatly crafted gizmo, and a fresh reminder that Nintendo remains a toymaker at heart,\" we wrote in our Mario Kart Live Home Circuit review. \nRead more",

And what better way to do it without the inconvenience of ever actually having to leave your house than with the Sim's 4's latest expansion?\nThe Sims 4: Cottage Living, which arrives on 22nd July, is the tenth full-scale Expansion Pack (and 42nd bit of paid DLC) to launch for life sim since its release in 2014, and - as its name very much implies - is all about cosy cottages and rustic charm.\nUnsurprisingly, top of the list of features coming in Cottage Living is the ability to settle down in a charmingly rustic new abode. Here, players can befriend the likes of wild rabbits, foxes, and birds, while also raising their own animals - including llamas, chickens, and cows for wool, eggs, and milk respectively - in order to start their journey to self-sufficiency.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's no secret that Team Fortress 2 has a bit of a bot problem, but the game also has a community that really enjoys mid-match shenanigans - and the two combined today in one of the funniest posts about TF2 bots I've seen so far. \nReddit user 2Noel posted footage of an Attack/Defend match in which Blu team was pitted against a bunch of bots - normally not great news for those wanting to keep their heads on their shoulders. Yet the team decided to try a different tactic to just charging into battle, instead choosing to conga their way out of spawn and onto the control points. And surprisingly, it worked. Stay tuned for the satisfying bot slaughter at the end of the match:  \nThe question you're probably asking right now is: why didn't the bots shoot the Blu team members? The answer, it seems, is that the bots are programmed to avoid shooting players who are using taunts and emotes. If you look closely at the video, you'll notice that players not engaged in the conga line (such as poor old atomdotdat) are instantly sniped by the bots, while the dancers remain unharmed. \nRead more",

Enemies were seen running past players to destroy their buildings instead, while some monsters became so confused about what they should be attacking that they essentially froze in place. I checked the patch out for myself and discovered local greydwarfs had stripped our village walls of decorations, while a run-in with a troll ended in disaster when it became a bit too interested in my friend's treehouse:\nIn any case, it seems Iron Gate noticed the AI change was causing a fair bit of chaos, and the AI has been tweaked once again to solve the problems. \nRead more",

Krollywood confirmed in a Reddit comment that the levels have been reuploaded to Far Cry 5's arcade mode under the name \"Golden Cry\". To find them on PS4 you'll need to search for the creator name \"Perfect-Dark1982\", and on PC the creator name is \"Graslu00\".\nKrollywood spent two and a half years recreating the 18 GoldenEye 007 levels in Far Cry 5's level editor, and you can hear a little about how he did it in the video below: \nRead more",

Well... new to PUBG, at least. \nThe freshly-released patch notes explain that Taego is an 8x8 map set in 1980s South Korea, with landscapes \"ranging from wide-open reed fields to the close quarters of Hosan Prison\". It's also got some wildlife, with flocks of birds that react to player movement and gunfire, so take your binoculars with you - those birds might just help you track down another squad. If you stream yourself doing that, you're a twitcher in two senses of the word. \nThe map also has a new feature called Comeback BR, which gives players who die before the first Blue Zone the ability to get themselves back into the game. All you have to do is stay alive in a separate \"Comeback Arena\" for a certain amount of time. It sounds pretty similar to Call of Duty: Warzone's Gulag, except it's more like another mini battle royale rather than a one-on-one battle to the death.

          "description": "If you've ever felt bad about keeping all your old files in a mess, here's something to make you feel better, as a much sought-after early version of Minecraft has finally been found - thanks to one player who made backups of her old laptop. Oh, and I guess this also means that tweeting everything is useful after all. \nAs spotted by Kotaku, Twitter user @lunasorcery explained in a thread that she'd helped a group of Minecraft historians find a long-lost early version of the game. Build Alpha 1.1.1 was apparently a \"long-running meme\" and \"holy grail\" for Minecraft archivist group Omniarchive, as the historians had never been able to track the elusive build down. It was an exceedingly rare version of the game that was released on 18th September 2010, and was only available for three hours and 25 minutes due to a bug that would turn the player's screen grey. \nLuckily, someone spotted a 2010 tweet by Luna in which she discussed the Minecraft update, and messaged her to ask if she had a copy of the build. She initially ignored the message, thinking there was \"no chance in hell\" that she would still have a copy, but last Friday another person contacted her about the tweet - and this prompted her to take a closer look. \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week, Valheim developer Iron Gate rolled out a patch that was intended to provide players with an extra level of challenge: enemies were tweaked to be more aggressive towards structures, meaning players would have to be more proactive about defending their homes. But some players feel Iron Gate went overboard with these changes, highlighting that the patch has resulted in some strange enemy behaviour - along with the wanton destruction of property. \nOver on the Valheim subreddit, players have argued that Valheim's monsters are now too eager to attack buildings, sometimes opting to destroy structures even when standing directly next to the player. This has led to some \"immersion-shattering\" enemy behaviour, with monsters looking uncertain about who they should be attacking. Some players, meanwhile, are simply exasperated at the amount of damage now being caused in monster raids. \n\"Earlier today I had a troll invasion and I had three trolls attacking my base non-stop,\" said Reddit user Squatch11. \"I literally couldn't get them to attack me. Half of my base was destroyed before I managed to kill them.\" \nRead more",

          "description": "Mass Effect Legendary Edition has certainly done the trick: it's rekindled a love of BioWare's original trilogy years after the games came out. But it's not just Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3 that are being judged once again. Fans are reappraising Mass Effect Andromeda, too.\n2017's Mass Effect Andromeda endured a torrid time upon release, with clips of dialogue scenes descending into meme status. There were other areas of the game that came under fire, including its limited character creator, bugs and animation quirks.\nBeyond that, though, Andromeda's missions, storyline and characters failed to set the world on fire. Without Commander Shepard, the Normandy and the original trilogy's cast of much-loved characters, Andromeda set out for a new galaxy, a new premise and new party members. I think it's fair to say it didn't stick the landing. Some thought the game was just okay, others considered it outright awful. Either way, Andromeda flopped and BioWare soon moved on, leaving it sequel-less.\nRead more",

It's a \"mystery simulation game\" called Crimesight, where players must deduce \"not only the culprit, but the victim as well\". What, were you expecting Silent Hill? \nThe social deduction game is set in a futuristic version of London where crimes can be predicted using an \"analytical programme developed using data harvested online\". This has led to reduced crime rates across the world, but the system predicts a crime that could \"plunge the world into chaos\", prompting the system's architects to create an AI called Sherlock to investigate and prevent this crime.\nSherlock must prevent the criminal mastermind AI (named Moriarty, of course) from committing simulated murder, while Moriarty will try to predict the perfect moment to murder an NPC avatar. The trailer explains that Crimesight allows for 2-4 person multiplayer, and that the game takes place on what looks like a virtual tabletop board. \nRead more",

How rude.\nThe latest Valheim patch notes explain that the new update will fix several AI issues, with monsters made \"slightly more aggressive\". They will now \"attack your buildings etc. when they are not able to attack you\", meaning you'll probably have to be more proactive in taking out enemies before they destroy your beautiful wooden structures. \"It's fun for the whole family,\" Iron Gate said in the patch notes. (Is it, though?)\nIf you're strolling through the Black Forest, you may also want to watch your head, as the Greydwarfs have had their aim improved - meaning they now have half a chance of actually getting a shot on target. A \"long forgotten Blob event\" has also been enabled, while bosses will no longer run from you. All in all, it sounds like the world of Valheim is getting a little more dangerous.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's time for the latest chapter in Valve's ongoing battle with Team Fortress 2 bots: this week sees a new update that should, in theory, make bot behaviour slightly less annoying.\nAs detailed on the Team Fortress 2 updates page, TF2 was patched on Tuesday with a number of measures that should limit what bots get up to when in-game. There's now a tool to control how many times players can change their name in a match, for instance, and for public matchmaking it seems this has been set to zero - thus preventing bots from frequently changing their names or mimicking real players. \nThe update also introduces a grace period at the start of matches to prevent players immediately calling votes, which should put the brakes on bots that are trying to deliberately clog up the vote-kick system. Similarly, players joining an in-progress game will face a cooldown before they can call a vote. Kick votes will also \"end early and automatically pass if the vote target leaves the match during the vote\". \nRead more",

          "description": "Might & Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for Might & Magic 10: Legacy - leaving some players unable to access significant portions of the game's single-player content and its DLC. And despite these issues, the game and its DLC are still on sale.\nThe server shutdown began on 1st June, after which players began to report problems accessing DLC areas from the game's The Falcon & The Unicorn expansion. Players who owned the DLC also found they were unable to play past Act 1 of the main game with the expansion installed. Some who bought the deluxe version reported they could no longer access the special in-game items included with that version (via PC Gamer). \nPlayers have been creating their own workarounds for the problems, with some editing NPC dialogue to do so, but so far there hasn't been an official fix. Ubisoft told Eurogamer it is \"aware and investigating the reported issues with our internal teams\".\nRead more",

Well, while holding VR controllers, I guess. \nVHVR is a community-made VR mod for Valheim that was first released back in April, and did a pretty good job of translating Valehim's Viking world into VR (even if players could only move using a standard gamepad or mouse and keyboard). Here's our own Ian Higton trying it out at the time:\nWork on the mod continued post-launch, and now VHVR has been given a game-changing update that adds motion control support. Thanks to the work of modder Maddy25 (who apparently almost single-handedly implemented many of the motion control systems), you can now interact with items in Valheim more directly. There's upper-body and finger tracking using VRIK, melee combat, bow and arrow controls, fishing, point and click building, and you can use your hands to interact with the environment. There are also custom VR controls for interacting with menus, along with switching and equipping items.\nRead more",

However, Nintendo has now made up for that no-show, sharing 20 minutes of new gameplay in a special Nintendo Treehouse livestream.\nAnnounced back in 2019, No More Heroes 3 - which is set nine years after the events of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle and two years after Travis Strikes Again - once again casts players as otaku and sometime-assassin Travis Touchdown. However, while previous games saw Travis murdering his way to the top of the United Assassins Association league, this third series entry ushers in a new threat, with players now charged with eliminating extraterrestrial enemies in order to reach number one in the Galactic Superhero Rankings.\nAs seen in Nintendo's new \"early look\" at No More Heroes 3, the series' wonderfully satisfying hack-and-slash action - built around Travis' lightsaber-like Beam Katana - makes a return, with no obvious surprises where core mechanics are concerned. Players will again need to combine the likes of basic moves, heavy moves, kicks, blocks, and rolls to defeat enemies (motion controls are optional) with the likes of finishers and jackpot bonuses also returning.\nRead more",

          "description": "You've thought it, I've thought it, but the question of what London would look like in the Fallout universe has never truly been answered... until now. \nA Fallout mod team is working on a huge project called Fallout: London, which is described as a \"DLC-sized mod for Bethesda's Fallout 4\". Although the team has been issuing updates on progress for some time, yesterday the group released a full reveal trailer, and the work done so far looks extremely impressive. Many of London's most iconic landmarks have been given a Fallout makeover - including Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, St. Paul's Cathedral and even the BT Tower. Oh, and there's some extremely hammy commentary over the whole thing. \nThere are some really nice touches throughout the trailer: you can spot plenty of London buses, murky tube stations and even a classic London pub. I'm also a big fan of the Beefeater who's embraced a more Raider-inspired look. It feels like there are some nods to Britain's involvement in WWI and WWII, with barrage balloons seen in the sky and soldiers camping out in trenches. \nRead more",

The banner has also changed colour from black to white - as if someone's flipped a switch to put it in light mode. \nSocial media account Xbox News also managed to spot a version for Forza Horizon 5, which you can see below.

In an interview with IGN, legendary director Hidetaka Miyazaki gave plenty of information on the background lore, along with some discussion of abilities, multiplayer and the game's structure.\nOne of the first topics discussed was Elden Ring's setting, The Lands Between, which has been deliberately designed to give \"an enormous sense of scale and this broadness and openness\". It's split into six major areas, each of which is the domain of a demigod. These are lined up to suggest a specific order in which to tackle them, but the player can make their own decisions about which to do first. \"You won't be able to access everything from the start, but there are a lot of different ways you can approach each area,\" Miyazaki explained. \"And there's a lot of freedom as to which order you tackle different areas as well.\"\nPlayers will be able to access a hub area a little later in the game, which you can \"branch out from\", and also the six main areas of The Lands Between. \"These will be the domains or the areas of the main demigod bosses,\" Miyazaki explained. \"From here, you're able to explore not only these mainline dungeon areas, but also a wide variety of catacombs, castles, and fortresses, which are interspersed throughout the map. These have a range of scale and scope, but the main dungeons are these six - these are the ones that you're going to be heading to on your adventures throughout the main world. \"\nRead more",

Well, the developer is back with another sci-fi offering, although this time it's all taking place on a run-down space station. \nTitled Citizen Sleeper, the game was previously teased under the name Project Sidereal, but developer Jump Over The Age revealed the new name and trailer during last night's PC Gaming Show. It's described as \"roleplaying in the ruins of interplanetary capitalism,\" with the player taking the role of a \"sleeper\" - in other words, a digitised human consciousness. The bad news is that you're also owned by a huge corporation that wants you back, and your body will deteriorate as part of \"planned obsolescence\" for escapees. This what happens when billionaires start jetting themselves into space, I guess. \n\"Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle,\" the Steam description explains. \"Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom.\"\nRead more",

Well, it turns out those rumours weren't far off at all! Square has now officially unveiled Team Ninja's action-RPG Final Fantasy spin-off, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins.\nStranger of Paradise follows a band of adventurers who, as the trailer repeatedly reminds us, want to kill chaos. Or at least stab it in the face a few times until its head pops off. \"Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine,\" Square elaborates in its announcement, \"Yet doubts remain-are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?\".\nMay's rumours suggested the game would slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja's Nioh games and From Software's Souls series, albeit with a more accessible focus, and today's reveal appears to support that. Square is promising \"exhilarating, action-packed battles\" against iconic Final Fantasy monsters in a \"world of dark fantasy\".\nRead more",

This was announced during Square Enix's E3 showcase this evening.\nThe game's also going live-service. The publisher treated audiences to a fairly brief trailer, featuring in-game footage of a frantic 3D action game with lots of armour and magical lightning and some decent operatic music. A follow-up developer interview revealed a game in which teams of players enjoy hack-and-slash combat and explore dungeons in groups of four. These dungeons are located on different floors of a giant tower, and end with a boss.\nRegular updates will allow for new moves that can be equipped as skills. There's a focus on character customisation and crafting, and a massive emphasis on builds, due to a \"Gideon coffin\" the characters wear that allows them to equip two additional weapons alongside the weapons they hold in their hands, and, I think, swing them about independently, a la Astral Chain. The game will ship with five weapon types, and there will be a website that allows players to tweak their builds while they're away from the game. \nRead more",

Industrial era features include resources like coal and oil, railways, and artillery and air battles - we actually had a chance to explore some more of this ourselves during our latest preview but barely got halfway there, despite playing a good 10 to 15-odd hours, which should give you an idea of just how long you get with this beta.\nRead more",

          "description": "Netflix's apparent mission to give every single video game in the universe the TV show treatment is continuing with three newly announced animated adaptations of Ubisoft properties: Splinter Cell, Far Cry, and unforgettable Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon.\nA Splinter Cell animated adaptation was first rumoured last July, but Ubisoft and Netflix have now made the show official. It'll follows the adventures of iconic video game series protagonist Sam Fisher after he's recruited to work for the NSA's mysterious Echelon Division.\nExpect black ops missions, stealth, and military tactics in a series that's being written by John Wick scribe Derek Kolstad. That's pretty much all Netflix has shared right now, other than this appropriately shadowy glimpse of Sam as he'll appear in the show:\nRead more",

It promises to be a busy one - debuting footage from the likes of The Witcher Season 2 and Cuphead - but first there are the opening three minutes of the streaming service's CGI Resident Evil series ahead of its release in July. \nKnown as Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, this animated adaption takes place several years after the events of Resident Evil 4, with Leon S. Kennedy once again serving as the US president's bodyguard - which would probably seem like a walk in the park compared to his usual adventures if it wasn't for the threat of an imminent zombie outbreak.\nClaire Redfield also plays a role in Leon's latest adventure, embarking on her own investigation as (the supposedly canon) events unfold, and if you're curious to see how proceedings kick off, you can do that via the first three minutes of the show below.\nRead more",

          "description": "Stray Bombay, the studio formed by Left 4 Dead and Portal writer Chet Faliszek, and Riot Games designer Kimberley Voll, has revealed its new game The Anacrusis.\nIt's - like Left 4 Dead - a co-operative shooter for four people, and it takes place on an abandoned starship on the edge of explored space. There you'll fight seemingly endless hordes of aliens in an \"infinitely replayable fight\", according to Summer Games Fest host Geoff Keighley, who announced the game. You'll unlock perks and weapons and \"new ways to play you can share with your team\", said Keighley.\nDespite the theme, Anacrusis looks like a very bright and upbeat game. It's not dissimilar to the Portal series, actually, with brightly lit, clean sci-fi scenery, and some arty splashes of turquoise and orangey-red here and there. Very pleasant.\nRead more",

It seems seekers will be given a very small radius in which they can see other players, leaving it up to those hiding to out-manoeuvre their pursuers. \nAnd that's not the only major gameplay change - after modders started doing it themselves, some new roles are officially being added to the mix, including Sheriff and Scientist roles. As of yet there's no details on how these work (even on the roadmap explainer page), so I imagine this will be explained at a later date. \nRead more",

Players take on the role of Sable, and embark on a rite of passage that sees her leave her tribe to explore the world on her hoverbike. It's got a gorgeous art style that's inspired by French artist Mobieus, and a sci-fi open world that feels very reminiscent of some of the wrecks seen in Star Wars. Oh, and it's set to launch on PC and Xbox. \nSable is being developed by a small team in the UK called Shedworks, who - you guessed it - work out of a garden shed. I visited Shedworks back in 2018 to learn about Sable's story - and also check out the shed for myself. \nRead more",

The one exception to this is Competitive Play mode, which will not permit mixed groups at all.\nRead more",

With the vaccine rollout now in progress, it seems some companies are making plans for what their workplace structure will look like in the future - and that includes Ubisoft. \nBloomberg journalist Jason Schreier earlier this week tweeted that Ubisoft had emailed employees about a new \"hybrid\" work structure, and Ubisoft has now published this email on its official website.\n\"In summary the future will be hybrid, offering the majority of Ubisoft team members the opportunity to balance home and office work,\" the post explains. \"This has been designed based on our learnings from the past year and from your feedback; this 'test and learn' approach is one we will continue to adopt moving forward.\" \nRead more",

          "description": "After a string of rumours, whispers and leaks EA has finally lifted the veil of the latest Battlefield, seeing the flagship first-person shooter moving away from the historical setting of recent entries to a near-future backdrop - with this year's model subsequently called Battlefield 2042. In a break from other recent traditions, it'll also do away with a single-player campaign, and there are no plans for an accompanying battle royale mode.\nBattlefield 2042 will instead focus on its multiplayer offering, supporting 128 players on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game support 64 players. There will also be the option of playing against AI bots, either solo or with a squad of friends. \n\"I think that's just something that enables us to really lean into what we are best at,\" Battlefield 2042 design director Daniel Berlin told Eurogamer about the lack of a single-player campaign - something that's been a series mainstay since Battlefield 3. \"If you look at the DNA of the studio, what we've been doing for so long, we just said you know what, we're not going to have a traditional single-player campaign this time around, but we're going to put all that emphasis and all those resources into building depth into the multiplayer. Because that is what we do best.\"\nRead more",

If you claimed the previous Disney+ Perk, you should still be able to claim this one - but it can only be activated on a new Disney+ subscriber account. \nIf you're thinking of only using the trial for that 30-day period, remember that like most subscription trials you'll need to manually cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period if you don't want to get charged for the next month. So if you're planning on tuning in just for Loki, you might want to wait a bit before activating your trial: the first episode releases today, but the finale airs on 14th July.

          "description": "We're still waiting for that big Heath and Home update, but in the meantime developer Iron Gate has rolled out another small patch to fix some of Valheim's bugs. This patch makes two previously-bugged raid events actually trigger in-game, and provides a number of other handy fixes to make your time in the 10th world slightly easier. Slightly. \nThe two events fixed in this update are \"you are being hunted\" and \"the horde is attacking\", which were previously in the game files but didn't trigger as expected. According to the Valheim wiki, the hunt event is supposed to spawn a bunch of wolves, while the horde event should summon a goblin army of Fulings (including Berserkers and Shamans). \nThe exact conditions for triggering these events are currently unknown, but the pattern established by previous events suggests the hunt event could require killing one wolf and Moder, while the horde raid should occur in-between killing Moder and the final boss. So if you're currently in the late-game, things are about to get a bit spicier. \nRead more",

          "description": "You may have already seen some mutterings about this on social media, but E3's online portal opened up to press this week - and to nobody's surprise, it's a real mess. This year's E3 is all-online thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and the portal is supposed to be some sort of substitute for the physical show, featuring virtual booths for exhibitors, online events, and a variety of articles and bits of content about games.\nThe portal goes a little further than you might expect, however, with old-school internet forums, an avatar system and a gamified rewards system. The latter is what really caught my attention, as not only can you earn points from nosing around the portal, but you can also compete in online leaderboards  to see who is The Biggest E3 Fan. Naturally, this appealed to my competitive side and I set out to land myself a spot at the top of the virtual podium. \"With a limited pool of games media, this will be a cinch,\" I thought. But alas, my attempts to do so were foiled by an unexpected enemy: the E3 portal itself. \nThings started off pretty well. After doing some strange password reset shenanigans to actually get into my account, the E3 website presented me with an avatar creator (if you've ever heard of a picrew, it's basically that). I don't know why the avatar creator exists, but I think it might also be the best part of the E3 website. It's surprisingly lenient with what it will allow you to do - there are colour wheels for your hair and eyes, and you can even move your facial features around. Don't expect the sort of silliness you can get from something like Nintendo's Mii Maker, but the E3 avatar creator isn't afraid to get a little weird:\nRead more",

The developers used Fallout 2's engine and basic mechanics to create a new story that's unconnected to the Fallout series: it adapts features like Fallout 2's skills and perks system, but adds new graphics, additional gameplay mechanics, and - of course - a bunch of new stories and quests. There's even a crafting system, a mini-game for hacking electronic panels, and a flexible structure with no main quest. \"Do you want to become the tyrant of Radius, or do you want to improve the lives of everyone in it?,\" the official mod page explains. \"The choice is yours!\"\nAs explained in the lore section of the mod's website, the game takes place in the year 2207 in the Silicon Valley region of the US. The Great War of 2013 created an irradiated wasteland, and while some managed to escape into improvised shelters (or a luxurious vault called Livos), many had to \"adapt to the new conditions on the evolutionary, genetic level\". Sounds rough. Anyway, some lucky survivors found themselves inside a skyscraper called Olympus when this all went down. The game centres on this skyscraper, which everyone in the wasteland seems desperate to enter: it promises energy with its solar panels and protection from the horrors outside.

          "description": "At the start of the weekend we heard that CD Projekt's stolen data was being shared online, and it seems the floodgates are now well and truly open. A bunch of dev-made bug compilation videos are now circulating on social media and file-sharing sites, showing some rarely-seen work-in-progress builds and rather spectacular bugs.  \nAs Eurogamer reported on Friday, some dev videos had already started to leak alongside the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 and Thronebreaker, and it appears many of these are now being shared on 4chan, Reddit and YouTube. Most of the videos are being shared using video hosting platform Streamable, but many are now being pulled offline (they are, after all, the result of an illegal ransomware hack). \nSome are short clips showing the player-character being ricocheted into the sky to the sound of Shooting Stars, or being knocked out only to wake up to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim opening. Others are more complex - one compilation shows several bugs with an off-tune recorder version of Spoiler (the track by DJ Hyper used in Cyberpunk's 2018 E3 trailer). Another lengthy edit called \"CyberElBuggado2020\" shows hotdog motorbikes, NPCs T-posing to the sound of Thriller, and Johnny Silverhand saying \"this is going to be a disaster\" in Spanish. \nRead more",
