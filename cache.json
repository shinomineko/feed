It's your typical mythological story of good versus evil, finding a man, watching him change the world or the world changes him. It's all the Joseph Campbell stuff that you'd love in a story.

Even more remarkably, it has also hit out at Sony for suggesting the Microsoft-Activision deal would stifle competition - and claimed PlayStation itself pays out money to block games coming to Xbox Game Pass.\n Read more",

          "description": "When PowerWash Simulator came out of Early Access, it became quite a hit  amongst the team here at Eurogamer. I was curious to see whether I'd enjoy it too, so I cashed in the free month of Game Pass that came with my new PC to give it a try.\r\n\n\r\nI enjoy it a lot. In the game's career mode, there is no pressure to finish a level quickly or efficiently and that's what I love about it. You can ignore the time and leave the hose running for as long as it takes you, and that's all part of the appeal. Bertie expertly summed it up in his review.: \"This is not a game about rushing towards an end,\" he wrote. \"This is a game about the sedate pleasures of repetitive work - a slower game about the satisfaction of a job well done. It's relaxing and calming, and that's a powerful quality.\" \r\n\n\r\nBut this inevitably got me wondering about the other end of the gameplay spectrum in PowerWash Simulator. Speed and efficiency, rather than leisure. True, you can already play the game's time-limited and water-limited modes, but they weren't as extreme as what I was imagining. I'm talking speedwashing. Was there anyone out there playing like that?  \r\n \nRead more",

Much of Sony's argument had focused on Call of Duty - which it claimed had \"no rival\" and was \"so popular that it influences users' choice of console\" - with the PlayStation maker suggesting, among other things, that the inclusion of Call of Duty on Microsoft's Game Pass service would hamper its ability to compete.\r\n\n\r\nMicrosoft's response is as wide-ranging as Sony's initial objections, touching on everything from the fact it has previously managed to grow Game Pass without Activision Blizzard's titles - suggesting Call of Duty mightn't be quite as \"essential\" as Sony claims - to a reiteration of its assurances that it won't be making Call of Duty an Xbox console exclusive.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A fan-made Half-Life 2 VR mod nearly eight years in the making will finally be getting a public release next month in the form of an open beta.\r\n\n\r\nEurogamer first reported on the Source VR Mod Team's Half-Life 2: VR mod in 2017, but that version was actually an extension of an earlier mod released for Razer Hydra back in 2013. Some time after the new version's announcement, the project appeared to stall - it entered \"its own kind of development hell and was all but abandoned\", according to the team's website - but it re-emerged in 2021 and is slowly approaching the finish line.\r\n\n\r\nHalf-Life 2: VR - one of several attempts to bring Valve's seminal shooter sequel to virtual reality headsets - promises a range of features, including room scale VR, the ability to manipulate items and weapons directly with your hands, full locomotion, a weapon selection menu inspired by Valve's Half-Life: Alyx, and tweaked vehicle rides intended to help reduce motion sickness.\r\n \nRead more",

And if you're curious to know how that might look, the developer has you covered with a new cinematic trailer in which Sherlock and Watson traverse the New Orleans bayous into a strange realm  that, pleasingly, looks to share more than a few aesthetic beats with Frogwares' Lovecraftian The Sinking City.\r\n \nRead more",

And now, following the official unveiling of new hero Vantage last week, the developer now confirmed a major overhaul for its original Kings Canyon map, alongside a level cap increase for players.\r\n\n\r\nKings Canyon has, of course, been around since Apex Legends' launch back in 2019, and Season 14's extensive overhaul aims to improve some of the ageing map's more troublesome issues. Before we get to the mechanical stuff though, there's perhaps the most immediately obvious change - upgraded lighting and a new skybox, both intended to make for a \"more immersive, vibrant environment\".\r\n\n\r\nIn terms of gameplay changes though, there's the new Relic point of interest, which is designed to help create a little bit more breathing space on the map in the early to mid game so squad battles are less likely to be interrupted by third parties. This has been achieved by filling the Skull Town and Thunderdome area sunk in Season 5 with sand and building a new series of winding, interconnected buildings for fresh skirmishes, complete with a giant skull centerpiece. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Shortly after Nintendo released the first wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass DLC in March, data miners uncovered what appeared to be a near-complete list of platforms each new wave would be pulling tracks from - and the recent arrival of Wave 2 appears to validate that leak, giving fans a solid foundation for the giddy speculation of classic tracks still to come.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing Wave 1's release, data miner Fishguy6564 shared a video of Mario Kart 8's track selection screen with the Booster Course Pass' ten remaining cups unlocked, complete with the platform origin of each included track. The then-unreleased Wave 2's Turnip Cup, for instance, was shown to contain four tracks taken from Mario Kart Tour, SNES, N64, and DS, while Propeller Cup listed tracks from Tour, GBA, Wii, and a final, yet to be defined course.\r\n\n\r\nWe now know, following Wave 2's release this week, that those leaked platforms line up perfectly with Mario Kart 8's newly expanded track roster. The final track listing for the Turnip Cup is New York Minute (Mario Kart Tour), Mario Cart Circuit 3 (SNES), Kalimari Desert (N64), and Waluigi Pinball (DS), while the Propeller Cup brings Sydney Sprint (Tour), Snow Land (GBA), Mushroom Gorge (Wii), and Sky-High Sundae (Tour). Notably, the latter is debuting as part of the Booster Pack but coming to Tour later, which might explain its absent tag in the leak.\r\n \nRead more",

As such, it'll follow a young Sherlock Holmes, along with his new acquaintance John Watson, on his first big case in London - an adventure that'll span Victorian London, a Swiss psychiactric ward, the New Orleans bayous, and the Scottish Highlands as the fledging detective wrestles with dark, Lovecraft-inspired horrors.\r\n \nRead more",

If you prefer your cars with a few more curves then there's a Maserati A6GCS/53 Spyder, an early example from the Italian manufacturer that established many of the styling cues that remain to this day. Finally there's a Porsche 918 Spyder, a hypercar that's been notable in its absence from recent Gran Turismo games. \nThat's all well and good, but the real star of the update is excused by the Tomica sponsorship carried on that Skyline Super Silhouette with an update to the Scapes photo mode allowing you to take your cars to toy towns and pose for snaps. It's not quite Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels, but it's a fun new feature nevertheless. \n Read more",

Fall Guys then continued on its merry Sonic-free way, but last month's Sonic Central livestream brought news that both character cosmetics would be returning to the game this August - as a sort of duel hoorah for Fall Guys' recent free-to-play launch and Sonic's 30th birthday - bringing with them a newcomer in the form of Tails.\r\n\n\r\nThat seemed to be as far developer Mediatonic and Sega planned to take their latest collaboration, but players started to suspect their might be more to come around a week ago, when a screenshot looking an awful lot like a new Green Hill Zone stage was spotted as appearing (presumably unintentionally) as part of Fall Guys' 'up next' stage select screen.\r\n \nRead more",

What followed was a generally enjoyable blend of open-world exploration, platforming, combat, and puzzling - all narrated by the perpetually bickering twosome of Prometheus and Zeus - whose biggest flaw (aside from its rather exhaustingly stuff-saturated map) was its over-familiarity.\r\n\n\r\n\"Blame Covid, blame budgets, blame Ubisoft, blame the paradoxically thrifty, endlessly repurposing way the publisher makes all its huge, expansive, generous games,\" Christian Donlan wrote in his review, \"but Immortals never really finds its own voice until the very end.\"\r\n \nRead more",

This announcement, its fair to say, has gone down like cold sick. \r\n\nOn the other hand, there's Mojang - the Microsoft-owned maker of Minecraft - which has drawn a line in the sand and said it will not integrate NFTs or allow others to use Minecraft in order to sell them.

          "description": "An official Detroit: Become Human manga series is launching on 22nd July in Japan.\nTitled as Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories, the comic will follow the story of Japan's own android revolution.\r\n\n\r\nA short synopsis and some panels have been released on Famitsu in Japanese. The story is set in 2038 and stars Reina, an android idol. It seems that Tokyo Stories takes place alongside the original story of Detroit: Become Human, contrasting the largely hostile attitudes to androids seen in the game with a society that is much more accepting of them.\r\n \nRead more",

Despite the return of plenty of familiar faces, and a strong opening fight (which you can see below), Eurogamer's resident Mortal Kombat fan Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly impressed by the end result.\r\n\n\r\nYet despite a generally lacklustre critical reception, the Mortal Kombat movie apparently did big numbers for New Line, opening at No. 1 at the US box office and ranking among the all-time top feature titles on HBO Max, where it simultaneously released. A sequel was almost inevitable then, and New Line confirmed its plans for a follow-up in January this year.\r\n \nRead more",

Take-Two was one of the few major publishers, alongside Activision Blizzard, not to respond publicly to the news.\r\n\n\r\nThree weeks on, though, Take-Two has now released its own statement across a limited number of social media channels, including its own LinkedIn page and subsidiary Zynga's Twitter feed.\r\n \nRead more",

There will also be some rebalancing for various weapons and other items, but most endearingly you will soon be able to \"pet the pets\".\nFollowing this, autumn will see a new Boss Rush area enter the game.

          "description": "Following from its release on PlayStation, Xbox and PC last year, publisher Microids has announced that Oddworld: Soulstorm is coming to Switch. Specially 'oddtimised' to run on the Switch's hardware, the game follows series protagonist Abe after the events of Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. \nAlthough the release date hasn't been announced yet, preorders are now open for the physical Limited and Collector's Odditions, the latter of which includes an exclusive nine-inch figurine of Abe and a 160-page artbook. Any pre-orders from participating retailers of the Limited or Collector's Odditions will also include the game's OST and a digital artbook. Sounds like some tasty goodies for any Oddworld fans.\nIn our Oddworld: Soulstorm review, Christian Donlan felt the game's magical moments and brutal setting were well worth the few rough edges. With the UK currently feeling the effects of climate change, perhaps this is a good time to revisit a game where you can live out your fantasy of destroying a means of capitalist production. \n Read more",

          "description": "If you found yourself impressed by Lego's recently unveiled Mighty Bowser set but couldn't quite shake the feeling something was missing - say, around 13ft - then Nintendo has you covered. As part of San Diego Comic-Con, the company has constructed an absolute behemoth Mighty Bowser, measuring over 14ft tall.\r\n\n\r\nThe retail version of Mighty Bowser is, of course, already pretty sizeable, weighing in at 2,807 pieces, making it the largest Lego Mario adult set yet. However, the San Diego version absolutely crushes that like a sudden Thwomp to the bonce, utilising over 663,900 bricks to create its magnificent heft.\r\n\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the 14-ft tall version is even articulated, able to move its thumbs, shift its arms, swivel its head and eyes indepently, and waggle its eyebrows for good measure. You can see the (slightly intimidating) thing in action below.\r\n \nRead more",

Most assumed it was lost to time after that, but, to everyone's surprise, it suddenly resurfaced during Microsoft's not-E3 showcase this June.\nThis new iteration of Captaincy follows the same basic premise of the originally teased update, introducing a host of new features designed around the idea of becoming the captain of your own distinctive vessel. These will include the ability to name your ship, decorate its cabin, earn unique rewards, make use of special new cash-in points across the ocean, and more.\n Read more",
