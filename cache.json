Architectural decoupling entails splitting functionality for different fundamental actions in a system, such as decoupling authentication (proving who is allowed to use the network) from connectivity (establishing session state for communicating). Institutional decoupling entails splitting what information remains between non-colluding entities, such as distinct companies or network operators, or between a user and network peers. This decoupling makes service providers individually breach-proof, as they each have little or no sensitive data that can be lost to hackers. Put simply, the Decoupling Principle suggests always separating who you are from what you do...</p></blockquote>",

Consider right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who located a hack in the tax code: &#8220;Because he was one of the founders of PayPal, he was able to use a $2,000 investment to buy 1.7 million shares of the company at $0.001 per share, turning it into $5 billion&#8212;all forever tax free.&#8221; It was perfectly legal&#8212;and even if it weren&#8217;t, the wealthy usually go unpunished. The author, a fluid writer and tech communicator, reveals how the tax code lends itself to hacking, as when tech companies like Apple and Google avoid paying billions of dollars by transferring profits out of the U.S. to corporate-friendly nations such as Ireland, then offshoring the “disappeared” dollars to Bermuda, the Caymans, and other havens. Every system contains trap doors that can be breached to advantage. For example, Schneier cites &#8220;the Pudding Guy,&#8221; who hacked an airline miles program by buying low-cost pudding cups in a promotion that, for $3,150, netted him 1.2 million miles and &#8220;lifetime Gold frequent flier status.&#8221; Since it was all within the letter if not the spirit of the offer, &#8220;the company paid up.&#8221; The companies often do, because they’re gaming systems themselves. &#8220;Any rule can be hacked,&#8221; notes the author, be it a religious dietary restriction or a legislative procedure. With technology, &#8220;we can hack more, faster, better,&#8221; requiring diligent monitoring and a demand that everyone play by rules that have been hardened against tampering...</p></blockquote>",

It&#8217;s about hacking.</p>\n<p><i><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/\">A Hacker&#8217;s Mind: How the Powerful Bend Society&#8217;s Rules, and How to Bend them Back</a></i> isn&#8217;t about hacking computer systems; it&#8217;s about hacking more general economic, political, and social systems. It generalizes the term <i>hack</i> as a means of subverting a system&#8217;s rules in unintended ways.</p>\n<p>What sorts of system? Any system of rules, really. Take the tax code, for example. It&#8217;s not computer code, but it&#8217;s a series of algorithms&#8212;supposedly deterministic&#8212;that take a bunch of inputs about your income and produce an output that&#8217;s the amount of money you owe. This code has vulnerabilities; we call them loopholes. It has exploits; those are tax avoidance strategies. And there is an entire industry of black-hat hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the tax code: we call them accountants and tax attorneys...</p>",

Mark it in your calendars and take the whole month off. Say Eurogamer said it was okay.\nThe August 2023 release date means Baldur's Gate 3 arrives, in full, just shy of three years after it first appeared in Steam Early Access, in October 2022. A lot has happened there of course - a lot of tweaking and tuning and honing the experience of the game. Its popularity allowed Larian to breathe and make BG3 a bigger, better thing.\nJust for giggles: the August 2023 date also means BG3 arrives 23 years after BG2, and 25 years after the original Baldur's Gate. I imagine you're probably not laughing if you remember those.\n Read more",

          "description": "A new investigation into Diablo 4's development has painted a picture of chaos and mismanagement at Activision Blizzard, reportedly resulting in a dash to meet a release date - said to be 6th June next year - that staff believe is \"unlikely\" to be met without \"many hours of overtime or cut features\".\r\n\n\r\nIn a new report by The Washington Post, assembled after speaking with 15 current and former Blizzard employees, it's claimed Diablo 4's development was troubled from the off, with leadership at the time instilling the project with a \"sense of inertia\" as large parts of the game were constantly revamped and scrapped - including a planned battle royale mode.\r\n\n\r\nTalking to The Washington Post, team members laid much of the early blame at director Luis Barriga and lead designer Jesse McCree, both of who left the studio in 2021, amid serious allegations of institutionalised discrimination and harassment at Activision Blizzard. Colleagues claim, for instance, McCree \"would grow intrigued by different aspects of the game and then lose interest and hand it off to other people without finishing what he started.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Yes, these two aliens will be joining the likes of Lara Croft, Nathan Drake and Mario, who have all made the transition to the big screen. \r\n\n\r\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, a new feature film from Amazon based on ToeJam and Earl's video game escapades will be heading our way sometime in the future.

Though treacherous, this hive of spectral activity may provide some clue as to the location of a vampire. If not, at least it'll be entertaining to defeat thousands of wayward spirits in the process.\"\r\n\n\r\nMore specifically, Legacy of the Moonspell introduces eight new characters - including Miang Moonspell, Menya Moonspell, Syuuto Moonspell, and Babi-Onna - plus new monsters, six new music tracks, and a \"huge\" new stage incorporating the likes of an abandoned castle, yokai-infested village, and snow-covered mountain. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Well, this is a nice surprise. Not only is the final content update for Assassin's Creed Valhalla now live on all platforms - a week earlier than planned! - but it includes a surprise tie-in to next year's Bagdhad-based Assassin's Creed Mirage. \r\n\n\r\nWe were expecting this last chapter of Eivor's story to arrive next week, on 6th December. Announcing its early release last night, Ubisoft blamed \"an unforeseen glitch in the Animus\". \r\n\n\r\nAs expected, this final dollop of Valhalla storyline sees Eivor wrap up her time in England and head off to North America one last time - where the game's opening shows she is buried. There's time for a few final goodbyes with some noteworthy people from Valhalla's long campaign, and then it's off to find out more about what Odin has been up to. \r\n \nRead more",

Movie, giving us our best look yet at the upcoming animated film from Minions maker Illumination. \r\n\n\r\nThe trailer showcases a good look at the film's version of Princess Peach (voiced by Anya Tayor-Joy) while Chris Pratt's Mario only gets a couple of lines of dialogue. Overall, it's a fun glimpse at some familiar Mario locales and characters, translated for the big screen. \r\n\n\r\nIf you're a Nintendo nerd like me, you've probably rewatched the trailer more than once to spot everything going on in the background. And there's some cool Easter eggs - particularly if you like the extended Donkey Kong family. Let's give it one more watch and dive in. \r\n \nRead more",

But that was not the case back in the original Witcher game, which featured a number of separate large maps and various smaller areas.\r\n \nRead more",

Partially-redacted documentation from this process has now been made public, revealing some eyebrow-raising arguments from Sony - which is trying to block the deal. \nBoth Sony and Microsoft have gone on the defensive to make themselves look the smaller fish - with Microsoft  admitting Sony's exclusives are better and Sony saying any loss of Call of Duty would leave itself \"extremely vulnerable\", particularly if the series was made available through the popular Xbox Game Pass. So, should Sony be worried - or is this all just performative theatrics?

Eyebrows were raised, however, with the news the latter two bundles would also add a total of 25 new death animations - 13 for protagonist Jacob and 12 for enemies.\r\n\n\r\nMuch of The Callisto Protocol’s pre-release publicity has focused on its myriad gruesome death animations as a key selling point - Striking Distance's CEO Glen Schofield discussed its \"gore engine\" with Eurogamer earlier this year - so there was a degree of incredulity when Striking Distance revealed more than two dozen of these would only be available to purchasers of the season pass, being sold as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition for an additional £20.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a bit baffling that it's taken so long, and there's still a little uncertainty precisely how it'll work and how good the payouts will be, but it does at least come as part of a generous update. \r\n\n\r\nThe big addition that comes with the 1.26 patch is a track that's entirely new to Gran Turismo, and is something a bit special. Road Atlanta's a 2.5 mile circuit set in the north of the state of Georgia, and is one of the finest road courses in the USA. It plays host to the Petit Le Mans each year, a challenging race that makes the most of its undulations and whip-quick esses for one of the most punishing endurance races where 10 hours feels more like 100 (at least that's what it felt like the few times I've run its iRacing virtual equivalent). \r\n \nRead more",

As was the case in last year's redux event, Expeditions will run in truncated form, each lasting for just two weeks before the next one rolls in - meaning players eager to acquire any rewards they might have missed (including those on Switch, who haven't had chance to play any of these yet) will have to work quick.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your mind back to the days of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and you may recall an infamous bug that allowed players to soar through the skies in a fashion that should not be not humanly possible. This became known as the 'Superman' exploit, due to the way the players looked when this glitch was in motion - positioned horizontally in a skydiving position.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now, when playing Call of Duty's most recent offerings of Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, you may well see this move in play once more. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's just your teammate channelling their inner Clark Kent. \r\n\n\r\nToday's version of the Superman exploit was recently shared by prolific Warzone 2 player Wuqi. In a compilation, the gamer can be seen bouncing off certain points on the maps while diving in the air, giving them a soaring boost. This, as you can see below, allows them to cover ground a lot more quickly than the more traditional methods of traversal.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It has, somehow, been a full year since Battlefield 2042 launched, and while it'd be premature to say DICE's shooter has bounced back from a disastrous launch it's certainly on firmer ground than it's been for a while. The belated launch of Season One in June was a small step in the right direction, while August's Season Two took bigger, bolder strides. Season Three, which kicks off on November 22nd, promises even more in the most radical season yet. \r\n\n\r\nWhat's most promising is the influx of players that should come as Battlefield 2042 hits Game Pass and EA Play, hopefully ensuring once sparse servers are fully-populated. It's part of a bigger push to get people playing Battlefield 2042, with free play periods for everyone across all platforms across December - on Xbox you can play for nada from December 1st-4th, on PC from December 1st-5th and on PlayStation from December 16th-23rd. \r\n\n\r\nSeason Three - which has been dubbed Escalation - also makes some big changes, with the most profound being a return of sorts of the traditional class system to Battlefield, with specialists now being grouped by their roles. There's a new specialist in the mix, too, with Rasheed Zain joining the fray. He's a double-amputee whose traits include a faster health recharge and an airburst launcher. \r\n \nRead more",

Elder Dragons Kushala Daora and Teostra, for instance, have now shaken off the affliction, only to emerge in Risen form - both available at Master Rank 120 or higher - causing them to become much more menacing when their anger peaks. \r\n\n\r\nThen there's the Chaotic Gore Magala, unlocked at Master Rank 10 or higher. This unfortunate beast has failed to complete the skin-shedding process that would normally see it turn into the Shagaru Magala, leaving it in a \"deformed\" halfway state that's able to use the attacks of both creatures.

Oh and there's enough Nuka-Cola to rot the teeth clean out of your skull.\r\n \nRead more",

To date, PC players have only been able to access Valhalla via Ubisoft's own launcher or the Epic Games Store.\r\n\n\r\nA Steam version of Ubisoft sports title Roller Champions was also spotted - and today was also made briefly available to view on SteamDb, all but confirming the game will launch there. Roller Champions feels like it has struggled to find much of an audience to date; a Steam launch would certainly help it along.\r\n \nRead more",

There's no word on how long this will take, only that \"nothing is off the table\" in terms of what potentially may change.\nGame operator Monumental said this was because it didn't have the headspace or resources to rethink the game while it was running it, and suggested Crowfall could return looking quite different indeed. If, that is, it returns. Crowfall has struggled since launch, and it was sold to Monumental in December 2021 partly because of this - because it needed significant change.\nI cannot ever remember an MMO ever doing something similar. In this article, I talk to Monumental about the decision and what it could mean. But first, a bit of background.\n Read more",

This led to speculation from fans about its production, and Stratton, who was working as executive producer on Doom Eternal, posted an open letter to the Doom subreddit to address rumours. \r\n\nA year and a half later, Gordon has written a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton's claims, with screenshots of emails and legal documents (with sensitive information removed) as evidence of the true timeline of events. He posted his statement on Medium, in which he alleged abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton. Gordon stated he has released it to defend himself, and urged people to not use it as an excuse for a hate campaign.\r\n \nRead more",

Should you look at spoilers? For some, uncovering the many unannounced creatures as they play is a core part of the games. For others, knowing what your new Starter Pokémon will eventually evolve into is a big deal.  \nWhichever side of the debate you're on, there's no doubting the level of interest in new Pokémon designs - seen this week when the final evolution of Starter cat creature Sprigatito sparked an avalanche of dubious fanart after an image was posted by a leaker. Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.\r\n \nRead more",

This middle-ground tier includes everything that comes with Essential, but with the bonus of a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games to have a go at.\r\n\n\r\nThen, finally, we have the most expensive of these tiers, known as Premium. This was marketed as a way for users to replay some of PlayStation's classic games from days gone by. The service covers every PlayStation console - from the original PS1 through to the PS5, as well as the PSP and, thanks to streaming, PS3 support.\r\n \nRead more",
