If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.</p>\n<p>Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what we&#8217;re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used. What was manual and individual has become bulk and mass. Surveillance has ...</p>",

          "description": "Author: Milan Plžík (Grafana Labs)\nThere’s been quite a lot of posts suggesting that not using Kubernetes resource limits might be a fairly useful thing (for example, For the Love of God, Stop Using CPU Limits on Kubernetes or Kubernetes: Make your services faster by removing CPU limits ). The points made there are totally valid – it doesn’t make much sense to pay for compute power that will not be used due to limits, nor to artificially increase latency. This post strives to argue that limits have their legitimate use as well.\nAs a Site Reliability Engineer on the Grafana Labs platform team, which maintains and improves internal infrastructure and tooling used by the product teams, I primarily try to make Kubernetes upgrades as smooth as possible.

We also know it's set for release in 2025 across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, with no news yet of a PC release. \nSo what did we make of the trailer and the news?

Safer Seas enables up to four friends to crew a ship across a private version of the world and access all PvE content - ranging from emergent events to Trading Company quests and narrative-driven Tall Tales - without needing to deal with other crews.\r\n\n\r\nIt is, then, pretty much exactly what people have been asking for since Sea of Thieves' launch back in 2018, albeit with a number of restrictions. Features including Guilds, Hourglass Factions, and live-service events such as Gold & Glory are all unavailable, and Rare is capping Trading Company progression at 40 in Safer Seas, meaning it won't be possible to reach Pirate Legend status without returning to High Seas mode. Additionally, gold or reputation for Athena's Fortune or their Reaper's Bones counterpart won't be earnable.\r\n \nRead more",

Three years later though, CD Projekt has announced it's restoring the long-missing rideable metro system in a surprise 2.1 update arriving next Tuesday, 5th December.\r\n\n\r\nThe 2.1 update coincides with the launch of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition (bundling together the base game and Phantom Liberty expansion) and was detailed in a new developer livestream, beginning with that long-awaited Metro system. \"The metro was not in our plans for a long time,\" producer Monika Janowska explained during the presentation. \"However, over time we've revisited our plan and... decided that it actually could be achievable.\"\r\n\n\r\nNight City's metro system, officially known as Night City Area Rapid Transit and described as an \"immersive way to travel through the world\", consists of five lines spanning 19 stations. It unlocks after Cyberpunk's Konpeki Plaza sequence relatively early on and can either be used as fast travel locations (as was the case prior to 2.1) or \"as a proper metro ride experience\" for those who'd like to take in the sights in a more leisurely fashion.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Mercenary class has been unveiled for Path of Exile 2, and notably, it brings a whole new style of play to the game: shooter gameplay. It doesn't mean the game has suddenly gone first-person, but it does mean optional - and fluidly interchangeable - WASD movement is coming to the series for the first time. And that you can now move slightly while attacking. \nThe Mercenary revolves around the crossbow weapon they carry, which behaves - depending on the type of crossbow - like either a shotgun, an assault rifle, or a sniper rifle. You can carry two kinds of crossbow at the same time. \nWhat your crossbow does also depends heavily on the kind of ammo you're using. If you're using incendiary ammo, for instance, your assault rifle crossbow will spin-up like a mini-gun and be devastating - and fiery - once revved up. Meanwhile, your sniper crossbow with incendiary ammo will behave more like a rocket launcher, exploding on impact. Frost ammo, meanwhile, freezes enemies and also creates varying kinds of frost effects - or ice walls - on the floor depending on which crossbow you use. Oh, and there's a grenade-launcher attachment too, because why not? And again, there are varying types of grenade you can fire.\n Read more",

It lets players powerwash vehicles, houses, parks and more, alone and in co-op. It's a particularly chilled experience, though hopefully the free Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy 7 DLC packs will be included. The SpongeBob Squarepants and most recent Back to the Future DLCs are paid extras.\r\n\n\r\nAlso included is Sable, a sparse adventure game with a unique, line-drawn art style and music from Japanese Breakfast. Donlan described it as a \"mesmerising game of exploration\" in our Eurogamer Sable review.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

The site says the publisher is likely to make the new release date official in \"the next couple of weeks\", potentially during December's The Game Awards.\r\n \nRead more",

And as its new confirmed December launch window approaches, the studio has shared a heap of new information on what to expect come the expansion's release, including confirmation it'll arrive alongside cross-save support.\r\n\n\r\nWhispers in the Walls introduces new mission types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set. It's an expansion primarily focused on the long-hidden laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos, and one that'll reveal the \"proverbial big bang\" that kicked off every event in Warframe.\r\n\n\r\nIn terms of enemies, the labyrinthine laboratory plays host to a much-expanded Necramech faction, including new Necrodogs, that players can battle using Whispers in the Walls' new Grimoire, a secondary weapon capable of flinging pages of devastating Void. But that's not the expansion's only new threat; at certain points, players will find themselves whisked away from the gothic gloom of Albrecht's lab to a vast Eldritch desert that serves as the home of the mysterious Man in the Wall. Here, they'll encounter a second new faction, the Murmur, nightmarish multi-limbed creatures resembling tech-infused biblical angels.\r\n \nRead more",

Plus, its substantial 1.49 update - which adds a dynamic night sky, the moon, HDR skyboxes, and more - is out now.\r\n\n\r\nKansas was confirmed to be the focus of American Truck Simulator 's next, post-Oklahoma expansion back in February, bringing the tally of explorable states in the game up to 14, joining the previously released California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma.\r\n\n\r\nAmerican Truck Simulator's rendition of Kansas - or the Sunflower State, if you will - promises to give potential visitors and their hefty transportation a tour of the area's \"native grasslands, streams, abundant blue skies, and green grassland vistas\". You can see some of that across copious screenshots in SCS' launch date announcement post.\r\n \nRead more",

For this secound outing, players step into the massive space clogs of an astronaut, Kathy, as she travels to the red planet in search of her missing father and technology that might just help save Earth from ecological disaster. \r\n\n\r\nWhat follows is a mix of first-person platforming and puzzle solving reminiscent of its predecessor, although it doesn't appear Deliver Us Mars enjoyed quite as positive a critical reception as the fist game. Still, free is free, so if some cerebral spacey excitement appeals, you'll want to be pointing yourself toward the Epic Games Store over the next seven days.\r\n \nRead more",

Being a PvPvE experience, the threats outside are twofold: there're the zombies - which can't be killed, meaning stealth is key to survival - alongside other human scavengers, who'll either need to be avoided or set upon with makeshift weaponry (firearms are a scare commodity).\r\n\n\r\nPlayers can come and go as they like, meaning once they're satisfied with their haul, they can return to the safe zone, where Nakwon's more simulation-focused activities occur. Here, hard-gained resources can be sold for money, which is used to increase Citizen Grades and secure better priveliges and benefits. \"Every day, you must decide whether to go out for Scouting or staying inside,\" Mintrocket explained previously. \"But, you must consistently secure more food to avoid starvation and make the best choice whenever an unexpected event occurs.\"\r\n \nRead more",

The two platform-holders swiftly retaliated by pulling the game from their storefronts. Epic subsequently filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google, and the case against Apple was settled in September 2021 in favour of Apple on nine of 10 counts. Earlier this year, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulings after appeals from both parties.\nNow Epic is back in court to wage its case against Google. While the court battle between Epic and Apple brought us the bizarre moment in which banana mascot Peely's decency was questioned in (apologies, in the tuxedo he's known as Agent Peely), so far the proceedings with Google have been revealing in a slightly different way.\n Read more",

          "description": "Epic Games has promised fixes to remedy early issues with Fortnite's newly introduced age ratings system, which has left players frustrated after many popular cosmetics have become unusable in certain parts of the game in order to meet ratings requirements.\r\n\n\r\nLast month bought the news Epic would be introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it called its evolution into a \"multi-game ecosystem\". Epic is, of course, currently trying to expand the reach of Fortnite by placing a greater focus on Roblox-style user-generated experiences build using its recently released Creative 2.0 tools - and the game's latest update means all these experiences now come with age ratings, starting at E for Everyone and going through E10+ up to Teen.\r\n\n\r\nSo far, so sensible. The problem is the seemingly haphazard way all this has been implemented in a game that has, up until now, been exclusively rated Teen. Essentially, as of Fortnite's latest update, every single bit of content, including all cosmetics, has been given its own age rating - and players are being prevented from accessing Creative mode experiences if they're wearing anything flagged as age-inappropriate. It doesn't help either, that seemingly benign cosmetics skins - a muscular cartoon cat, for instance - are rated Teen-only and considered unsuitable for children, while others, such as Halloween's Michael Myers are rated a-okay for the young 'uns.\r\n \nRead more",

It can be found in locations where Unrivaled items spawn, but is most likely to drop from Bellwether-themed containers in the open-world or vampire nests.\r\n\n\r\nBeyond the Basilisk, Redfall's latest update brings bug fixes, balance improvements, and more - as detailed in its patch notes - touching on all aspects of the game, including AI and NPCs, gameplay and missions, heroes, UI, audio, and accessibility.

Reports of inappropriate behaviour can now include that audio so Epic can hear evidence for itself and swiftly bring down the banhammer.\r\n\n\r\nA detailed technical blog lays out how Epic has come up with a series of policies over when it stores any data you choose to upload, and when voice reporting will be enabled (you can switch it off, but only if you're over 18 and playing in parties with friends with similar settings). \r\n \nRead more",

Wildcard finally slapped the Xbox version with a 15th November release date last week (the PS5 edition remains TBA), but that's now slipped again too.\r\n \nRead more",

If you're looking to catch up on the excitement, or simply need a reminder, you'll find a full breakdown of everything featured during the show below.\r\n\n\r\nShantae Advance: Risky Revolution sees developer WayForward reviving the cancelled Game Boy Advance instalment of its acclaimed platform series nearly two decades on. To progress through its challenges, players will need to take advantage of Shantae's animal transformation abilities, as well as her newfoud power to rearrange stages by switching the foreground and background, and it'll also feature a 4-player local battle mode when it launches next year.\r\n\n\r\nDeveloper Pugstorm's Core Keeper is a \"mining sandbox adventure\" for up to eight players set in an \"endless\" procedurally generated cave system. There's an ancient mystery to be solved, but doing so requires players to hone their survival skills by mining for relics and resources, building bases, growing crops, and hatching pets, as they push further into the subtarrenean world and take on its monsters. This one's due to release for Switch in summer 2024.\r\n \nRead more",

This time, the acclaimed studio - which has previously dabbled in the likes of visual novels, turn-based strategy, exploratory adventuring, and murder mystery - is combining its acclaimed narrative expertise with 2.5D platforming, as Moira sets off on a journey across the Highlands, where \"every peak has a story to tell and every valley echoes with song.\"\r\n \nRead more",

Activision describes the launcher as \"the front door for Call of Duty\" and states \"players have control over the footprint of their Call of Duty experience on their platform of choice, and it's all contained within one unified location\".\r\n\n\r\nIn practice, however, it's confusing plenty of players and has resulted in huge file sizes - as previously reported, the install size of the complete package is over 200GB on some platforms.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

However, the developer has now announced it has delayed the game at the last minute to \"allow for additional polish time\". More work is needed to make sure Broken Roads isn't broken on release, essentially, with the help of more QA testing.\r\n\n\r\nIn a post on Steam, the Broken Roads team stated the game was \"content complete\" but \"coming in longer\" than originally expected. The developer said its roughly 30 hours of gameplay and vast dialogue had made it \"extremely time-consuming to properly test\" all of the game's content.\r\n \nRead more",

Well, there's some good news: Valve is reportedly readying a feature that'll let you mark specific games as \"private\" so you can hide your more unusual tastes from other users while still maintaining a public profile.\r\n\n\r\nAt present, Steam's privacy settings don't support the kind of granularity needed to hide individual games, only enabling users to dictate broad categories - game details, friends list, inventory, screenshots, and workshop items - to keep discreet.\r\n\n\r\nAs spotted by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik, however (thanks PC Gamer), Valve is seemingly poised to add a 'mark as private' setting to individual titles, so they can specifically be hidden from the prying eyes of friends. That means you won't have to lock down huge chunks of your profile just to avoid difficult questions about the amount of time you've been playing Coquettish Elbow Reveal VR Edition. Or, in my case, 400 straight hours of Disney Dreamlight Valley.\r\n \nRead more",

In 2009, after several difficult years, it was acquired by Crytek, becoming Crytek UK, who then sold it to Deep Silver in 2014, where it became Dambuster Studios - which made this year's Dead Island 2. However, in May 2021, Deep Silver announced it was reviving the Free Radical name and creating a new studio specifically to make more TimeSplitters, with original Free Radical co-founders Steve Ellis and David Doak at the helm.\r\n\n\r\nUnfortunately, VGC now reports this new Free Radical is the latest studio to be impacted by parent company Embracer Group's major restructuring programme, which was announced following the collapse of a massive $2bn deal in May and has resulted in extensive layoffs and closures throughout 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

Permadeath is enabled, and if the player's entire party dies the save is erased. That's all on top of the extra difficulty added by Tactician mode, the second most difficult option after Honour mode.  \n Read more",

The scope of the patch doesn't include new content, balance changes (outside of correcting obvious errors), or anything which doesn't fit with Bethesda's original vision for the game.\r\n\n\r\nI spoke to Timothy \"Halgari\" Baldridge, one of the founders of the SCP, to find out why the team came together to, in essence, do Bethesda's work for them, and ask whether they've ever had any contact with Bethesda. I came away from our chat with a deeper appreciation for the project, which is more than just a simple effort to improve the experience of Starfield. It's a collaborative effort between several modders and players to create a truly community-owned, open-source project, with standard practices of software development in place.\r\n \nRead more",
