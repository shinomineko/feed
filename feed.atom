        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Treasure's classic shoot-em-up Radiant Silvergun is coming soon to Steam, the first time it's been available on PC.



Originally released in 1998 on the Sega Saturn and in arcades in Japan, it was later released on the Xbox 360 in 2011 and last year the Nintendo Switch with local co-op play and online leaderboards, as well as updated graphics.


Judging by the trailer on Steam (the same as the below Switch trailer), it's this version that will soon be released - though the exact release date is unknown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next patch for Diablo 4 will arrive next week and bring buffs for the vilified Sorcerer and Barbarian classes.


In last week's fireside chat with the developers, Blizzard promised improved "effectiveness and fun" for these two classes - now we know exactly how in the latest patch notes for 1.1.1.



For Sorcerers, the intention was to improve late-game survivability and move away from "kiss-curse" effects where players gain power but lose it elsewhere. For Barbarians, the flow of combat will be sped up by increasing Fury generation and the power of Unique items in the late-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Striking Distance Studios, the developer behind last year's sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol, has laid off 32 employees amid efforts to "realign the studio's priorities".


In a statement provided to IGN, the developer wrote, "Striking Distance Studios and [publisher] Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio's priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honouring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment."


As reported by VGC, a number of affected employees began publically discussing the layoffs on social media prior to Striking Distance's official announcement. These included associate level designer Thomas Catalano, VFX artist Matt Christopherson, associate producer Nora Falcon, level design assistant Justin Fields, production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, and senior environment artist Matthew Smith.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to April 2020, and you might recall the wholly unexpected announcement that infamous 80s jungle horror Cannibal Holocaust would be getting a video game sequel. The project's seen a tumultuous few years - and several changes in direction - since then, but its developer has now shed a little more light on its behind-the-scenes struggles, and provided an update on the form it'll take when it eventually arrives next year.


Cannibal, as the project was initially known back in 2020, was announced as a collobaration between Italian developer Fantastico Studio and Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato. Based on one of Deodato's unpublished screenplays, it's technically the fourth sequel to Cannibal Holocaust - a movie that gained notoriety on its original release for its graphic violence, depictions of sexual assault, and actual animal cruelty, making it something of an unlikely candidate for the video game treatment.


In a new interview with PC Gamer, Fantastico's creative director Andrea Valesini explains its original concept for the game was to adapt Deodato's screenplay into a format resembling a visual novel. As per its initial announcement, the project was due to release by the end of 2020, but after an unexpectedly positive response to Cannibal's reveal, the studio decided "it definitely made sense to invest more money into the game" and opted to tackle the screenplay in a more ambitious form, turning it into something closer to an point-and-click adventure.

Judging by Microsoft's post announcing the new feature, getting things working is a pretty straightforward process, piggybacking off the streamlined Discord chat functionality - which replaced the previous mobile device faff - introduced to Xbox last October.


All users need do in order to stream to Discord is press the Xbox button on their controller to access the guide, head to 'Parties & chats', then select 'Discord' from there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What the Golf - developer Triband's extremely daft, but wonderfully entertaining golfing oddity - is gearing up for a busy few months. First up, its free Among Us collaboration is making the jump from Apple Arcade to PC and Switch tomorrow, 3rd August, then the game will be making its  PlayStation debut "soon", with more free content to follow.


What the Golf, if you're unfamiliar, serves up a succession of dependably ludicrous golf-flavoured mini-games, all loosely themed around the notion of hitting things with club. The basic rules are re-jigged and re-written to increasingly improbably degrees with each new level - one stage might see your golf ball turned into an awkwardly rotating office chair, another might send you into space - and the end results is a ceaselessly surprising joy (even if you're not much of a golf fan), that was one of our favourite games of 2019.


Since its original Apple Arcade release, What the Golf has jumped to PC and Switch, receiving various bits of free post-launch content along the way. One of those updates, the aforementioned Among Us collaboration, arrived this April as an Apple Arcade exclusive, but it new overworld and 35+ new levels come to Switch and PC tomorrow, 3rd August.

Speaking to Polish outlet Wyborcza (and translated by Redanian Intelligence), Baginski tried to explain why the TV series had changed plot elements from Andrzej Sapkowski's novels. 


The producer explained a lot happens behind the scenes, such as scripts needing to be rewritten due to a cast member falling ill. "There are a lot of understandable reasons why controversial decisions are made, but the viewer does not have this context, so sometimes it hurts because something was better in the book," Baginski reasoned.

Step up, Merlin the dog - who is coming to Modern Warzone 2 and Warzone 2.0 as part of the new Season 05: Blackcell.


In battle, Merlin - and other "tactical pets" which are yet to be unveiled - will stay strapped to your person, a bit like a gun holstered at your hip. But Merlin and his friends aren't just for show! You can also select your animal friend to carry out a "devastating" finishing move.

The policy will go into effect on 29th August, and has been created from discussions with creators, backers, and "other platform leaders", Kickstarter said.

When submitting a project, creators will be asked to state whether AI is used and how. Creators will also need to confirm they have consent to use any works or data being fed into the AI. Submissions will be put through a "human review process" to ensure the use of AI has been properly disclosed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remnant 2 is doing alright for itself; not only has the Souls-esque procedural shooter secured some extremely positive reviews, it's also selling well too; and amid all the general positivity around its release, there's a bit more fun news courtesy of a whole new secret class that developer Gunfire Games squirrelled away for dataminers to find.


The class (or Archetype, as Remnant 2 would have it) in question is known as the Archon, and requires players to go through an extremely convoluted set of steps to unlock, ranging from activating skills on specific Archetypes at certain levels to equipping a whole lot of gear before hefting the everything over to a very particular place.


The requirements, then, are not the kind of thing anyone is really ever likely to stumble across by accident, with Gunfire Games instead having designed the Archon class to be something that could only realistically be uncovered by dataminers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Volition's beleaguered Saints Row reboot has almost reached the end of its journey - as far as the studio has currently revealed, at least - with the game's third and final bit of DLC, titled A Song Of Ice And Dust, now confirmed to arrive next Tuesday, 8th August, ahead of a Steam release for what was previously an Epic Games Store PC exclusive on 24th August.


Specifics surrounding A Song Of Ice And Dust are still a little thin on the ground, but a brief synopsis accompanying today's release date news sets the scene for the DLC thusly: "When a crippling ambush decimates the Dustlanders, it's up to fierce rivals Bossonius and Gwendolyn Firebird to join forces and defend The DustFaire from a new foe."


As previously revealed when Volition shared its post-launch development roadmap for Saints Row earlier this year, the reboot's third and final paid DLC expansion will introduce new story missions, new enemies, new cosmetics, and more.

More specifically, Apple's gaming subscription service is getting a version of the maraca-shaking classic called Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go, which arrives on 29th August - the same day Samba de Amigo: Party Central launches on Switch.


Party-To-Go will feature 40 songs when it arrives in August, with more to follow after launch. There's no complete track list to peruse yet, but Sega's official announcement says it'll feature three songs exclusive to the Apple Arcade game: Daddy (feat. CL) by Psy, Lady Gaga's The Edge of Glory, and The Walker from Fitz and the Tantrums.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a month after shooting itself into space for the first time, asymmetrical multiplayer horror game Dead by Daylight is doing it all over again, only this time with an official license for the quintessential space scare-'em-up, Alien.


That's Alien singular, of course, Ridley Scott's seminal 1979 space horror in which Sigourney Weaver's iconic action hero Ellen Ripley, along with her crewmates aboard the spaceship Nostromo, are terrorised by an even more iconic phallus-headed extraterrestrial predator known as a Xenomorph. Someone also gets a tummy ache; it's great.


That single, deadly foe (as opposed to the umpteen creatures present in James Cameron's action-heavy 1986 follow-up, Aliens) makes Alien the perfect fit for Dead by Daylight's four-survivors-versus-one-killer set-up. As of right now, however, developer Behaviour Interactive is remaining coy about which of the movie's characters we might get to play as.

This advice comes direct from developer Larian, which said that doing all of the above would "reduce the risk of file conflicts when the final game downloads", meaning "more playing, and no troubleshooting!"

Players who do have mods installed are also advised to ensure they do not automatically re-download.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rayman's long-awaited return mightn't be quite what fans were hoping for - arriving as he is in a bit of DLC for the excellent Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope instead of his own game - but something's (hopefully) better than nothing, and Ubisoft has now confirmed its beloved limb-flinging mascot will be making his entrance on 30th August this year.


Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope: Rayman in the Phantom Show is described as a brand-new DLC adventure that'll be separate from the base game's storyline. Here, Rabbid Mario and Rabbid Peach stumble across the Space Opera Network, an "uncanny" TV studio run by the Phantom, one of the antagonists in Ubsoft's previous Mario + Rabbids game, Kingdom Battle.


"As the TV studio's rating are lower than ever," Ubisoft explains in its release date announcement, "he needs the help of true stars to help him get his past glory back."

If you head to The Last Hope's Nintendo eShop store page now, you will instead be greeted by a 404 message, and a generic image of Star Fox's Peppy Hare (which is actually more pleasing on the eye than what was there previously).

A new game for the franchise, titled Transformers: Reactivate, is currently in development by Brink developer Splash Damage, but if you were hoping to brush up on older titles ahead of its release, you're out of luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you thought there wasn't anything else left to discover in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, you'd be sorely mistaken. Zelda engineers have now discovered a way to use what they're calling "quantum entanglement" to connect objects together over large distances, without a visible connection between them. 

This process, which has been dubbed "q-linking" by the community, has a brief yet rich history - a previous q-linking method was found in an earlier version of the game but has since been patched out by Nintendo as of version 1.2.0.

Nevertheless, that hasn't stopped Zelda players from experimenting with the game's physics and figuring out the boundaries of what can and cannot be achieved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On its surface, Pikmin is a cute strategy game about growing little plant people and gathering treasure. Delve deeper into its lore, however, and you'll find fans debating the series' apparent commentary on human extinction, and all sorts of timey-wimey shenanigans going on to make its many story elements match up. 

Spoiler warning: the following article discusses endgame details for Pikmin 4.

Before Pikmin 4, I'd never spent much time trying to make Pikmin's setting make sense. It's based on Earth, obviously, though a version with different animals and no humans in sight. And yet, you can still run around and find evidence of human existence - and seemingly very recent human existence at that, with freshly-baked food and other objects simply lying about. Are humans extinct, or have we all simply popped out for tea? It doesn't really matter to the simple stories Pikmin games tell.

Tekken 8's latest network test ran over the weekend, and provided those taking part with a taster of what's in store. But, of course, the beta's files were cracked, allowing some players to continue beyond the test period. 


Perhaps understandably, Bandai Namco does not want this to continue and has now issued a warning to anyone playing a cracked version - saying that anyone continuing to play breaches both the game's terms of service and the Tekken World Tour code of conduct.

Since launching back in 2016, American Truck Simulator's digital reimagining of the US - with its miles of winding road and endless sweeping vistas - has been steadily expanded and refined through a mixture of free and paid updates. Oklahoma brings the game's total number of explorable states up to 13, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas.


SCS says "wonderful state parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends" await those that pick up American Truck Simulator's Oklahoma DLC, and its arrival will be accompanied by a new World of Trucks community event tasking players with communally amassing a total of 111m miles travelled while delivering cargoes - during jobs of at least 100 miles - to or from any of the 10 cities including in the expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, the heavily Jet-Set-Radio-inspired adventure from developer Team Reptile, launches for PlayStation and Xbox on 1st September, two weeks after Switch and PC.


As a mere glimpse will confirm, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk pays homage and then some to Sega's beloved Dreamcast classic Jet Set Radio, sporting an immediately familiar cell-shaded aesthetic as players skate, skateboard, and cycle through the futuristic streets of New Amsterdam, dodging militarised police, spraying graffiti, and facing off against other crews.


Bomb Rush Cyberfunk's New Amsterdam features five main boroughs to explore, and players can make use of a "unique environment based trick system" that includes combos and boost tricks as they roam. Additionally, there're new crew members to recruit along the way, plus a composer line-up including Hideki Naganuma, who wrote Jet Set Radio's soundtrack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following EA Sports FC 24's formal unveiling earlier this month, the steady dripfeed of news continues, with EA now revealing a partnership with the Ballon D'or that'll see the presitgious award come to Player Career mode via a glitzy in-game end-of-season ceremony - for players on current-gen consoles and PC, at least.


The Ballon d'Or has been awarded annually to the best football player of the season by French magazine France Football since 1956, and an award specfically for female players was introduced in 2018. Come the arrival of EA Sports FC this September, those that manage a particularly strong individual season in Player Career mode can earn the Ballon d'Or in-game.


That manifests as a glitzy award ceremony where the winning player steps up on stage to receive the prize amid rapturous applause from the audience. You can watch the proceedings in the latest EA Sports FC video deep dive below, which this time focuses on Career mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has submitted a material changes of circumstances document to the UK's regulator which stands opposed to its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, urging it to drop its block of the deal. 
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority previously ruled that the deal would not be allowed to go ahead back in April, citing concerns on Microsoft's current, and potentially future, dominance in cloud gaming. 
Despite that setback, Microsoft has continued to sign deals with other companies and took on the US Federal Trade Commission in court (and won), leaving the UK's stance to the deal looking increasingly isolated. And it's these fresh commitments, Microsoft says, which should now be considered by the CMA. Had the CMA made its original decision with these in mind, Microsoft now says, the CMA would have ruled differently.

The beta was announced by Hideaki Nishino on the official PlayStation blog earlier today, along with what to expect and how users can take part.

The update will include a "map rework" of Hourglass – expect improved line of sight, traversal, and "combat encounters" now the size has been reduced – as well as all-out warfare attachments for vault weapons SMGs and LMGs, better squad management through improved squad orders, better ammo crates, and dispersion tweaks to SMGs and LMGs.

The rationale behind shrinking the Hourglass map is to "keep combat focused while having more opportunity to defend yourself through added cover".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, after countless rumours and leaks, GameMill finally confirmed that Super Smash Bros.-style fighting game Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 was indeed on the way. Now, however, it seems retailers may have jumped the gun and are listing the game as launching on 24th October.

Whilst we can only take this with the requisite bucket of salt for now, retailers like Amazon UK and Best Buy in the US have already listed the game as releasing at the end of October, even though the launch date has not been formally – or publicly – confirmed. 

The release date has caused quite a commotion with fans of the fighting game, as it releases near or on the same day as highly-anticipated titles like the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection, Sonic Superstars, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Spider-Man 2.

In an interview with French YouTuber Julien Chièze – spotted and translated by PCGN – Ubisoft lead producer Fabian Salomon has confirmed that during internal playtesting, it took most players around 20 hours to complete Mirage if they "rushed", and "25-30 hours for completionists".

"Given that we do a lot of playtesting internally at Ubisoft, it's part of our process, we really want to get as close as possible to the players, so we'll say that the latest playtimes we've received average at around 20-23 hours," Salomon said.

That may not sound impressive given PUBG: Battlegrounds holds the top spot with 3.2 million concurrent users – dwarfing that of second place CS:GO's 1.8m peak – but it's a considerable achievement, eclipsing the top concurrent Steam totals for games like Resident Evil Village (106,000), Battlefield 2042 (105,000), and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (103,000).

Its predecessor, Remnant, holds a more modest concurrent record of 48,289 players on Steam, according to SteamDB.

Not to be confused with the more contemporary 2023 game of the same name which runs on different servers and remains unaffected, Activision was forced to take the 2009 version offline on Steam whilst it "investigated reports of an issue".

Although Activision hasn't confirmed what the alleged "issue" is, players believe it is connected to a post shared on the game's Steam forums back in June that warned players to run an antivirus scan, positing that a trojan was being spread almost players "using hacked lobbies".

Developer Grinding Gear Games revealed this to me and a group of press during a briefing ahead of ExileCon in New Zealand this weekend.
The silence around Path of Exile 2 has been almost total since it was announced in 2019. We've seen two chunks of gameplay and that's it. The reason for this silence is because the game has changed significantly since then. Originally, it was going to be an extension of Path of Exile 1 and share content with it,  but now, Path of Exile 2 is a completely separate game.

While we have known about her inclusion for a while now, with developer Larian confirming it to our Bertie earlier in the month, her magical, menace of a character had remained largely under wraps until now. However, new details have now been released about this "grandmaster of murder".


In a new video, Robertson introduced her upcoming villain as "affectionately unhinged", revealing that players won't know when she is about to pop up in Balder's Gate 3 thanks to her shapeshifting abilities. In fact,  Orin is able to take the form of anyone - "perhaps even someone in your camp".

The developer said Ratatan's gameplay will incorporate a "unique combination of rhythm and strategy", and see players taking on the role of a conductor. This conductor has the very important job of controlling an army of the titular Ratatan, which will be able to "attack, defend and support" as they march against other armies in the game. 


Additionally, these music loving animal-like creatures will be able to "gather 'Cobuns' that can chant, move and attack according to the instructions". As a result of all this musical mayhem, the developer has promised "one massive rhythmic showdown!" You can see how it all looks in the video below.

The presentation gave us another chance to see the harrowing environments we will be presented with on release. We will be able to explore Axiom, the realm of the living, and Umbral, the realm of the dead.


Each of these realms will have their own enemies, characters, treasures and the like. One example of an enemy in Umbral was a rather unusual head with arms and legs, but no body. This chap is known as a 'Mendacious Visage', and I certainly wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night (although, that is probably exactly what will happen whenever I play the game). There was also another enemy that reminded me of Silent Hill's Pyramid Head.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We demonstrate how images and sounds can be used for indirect prompt and instruction injection in multi-modal LLMs. An attacker generates an adversarial perturbation corresponding to the prompt and blends it into an image or audio recording. When the user asks the (unmodified, benign) model about the perturbed image or audio, the perturbation steers the model to output the attacker-chosen text and/or make the subsequent dialog follow the attacker&#8217;s instruction. We illustrate this attack with several proof-of-concept examples targeting LLaVa and PandaGPT...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Snoop Dog has previously appeared in Call of Duty, and keeping with tradition is set to be "ready for any operation, whether it's going under Deep Cover or going in guns blazin'..."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 has launched with a strong start in Japan, with sales of 401k boxed copies over its first week on sale. 


To put that into context, this is better than the total boxed sales of Pikmin's three previous Japanese launch weeks combined: with 101k sales for Pikmin 1 and 161k first week sales of Pikmin 2 - both on the GameCube - and 92k first week sales of Pikmin 3 on Wii U.


These numbers from Japanese sales company Famitsu (via VGC) paint a rosy picture, although the comparisons here come with caveats - for instance, that Switch has a far higher userbase than either GameCube or Wii U - and this game has seen heavy promotion in Japan in particular.

In this TikTok clip from 2021, Fantano reacts to a video of someone else cutting a pizza up into smaller and smaller pieces. "It's enough slices!", the exasperated Fantano shouts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday saw the release of Desert Treasure 2 - The Fallen Empire in Old School RuneScape - the MMO's first Grandmaster quest since 2019.
A sequel to the classic Desert Treasure quest released back in 2005, Desert Treasure 2 - The Fallen Empire sends players back to the depths of the Kharidian Desert to explore a vault connected to the fallen Zarosian empire where they'll once again get caught in the plans of the mysterious Mahjarrat. 
As many RuneScape players will know, the lore in Old School RuneScape frequently deviates from the stories told in its modern counterpart due to its being created from an August 2007 archive. This means any quests released after this date, King's Ransom being the last, are not present in Old School RuneScape, allowing the developers to not only craft stories unique to Old School, but to take the ones which overlap in a different direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil 4 recently got a remake, but now it's time to take things to a different perspective. May I present a fan modded side-scrolling demake of Capcom's Las Plagas infected game to fulfil all our survival horror needs.


This demake comes from DooMero, and is known as the Resident Evil 4 2D Edition. It was created on GZDoom, an engine and modding tool often used for various Doom creations. In fact, the DooMero has dedicated their creation to the Doom community. 


Earlier this week the creator uploaded a 30 minute video showing the opening moments of their Resident Evil 4 demake. It all starts as you would expect, with Leon Kennedy (and his lovely jacket) searching for the president's daughter in the unnamed rural village in Spain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of the Emerald Powers in Sonic Superstars have been revealed, as well as details on its Special Stages.


As with previous 2D Sonic games, Chaos Emeralds are acquired in the game's Special Stages. Now, each Emerald will grant players a special ability to be used throughout the zones.


The idea behind this was to give players smaller rewards, where in previous games a reward was given only once all Chaos Emeralds are acquired (usually Super Sonic).

Gaming revenue overall increased by 1% ($36m) driven by growth in Xbox content and services, but this was offset by the decline in console sales. Content and services revenue increased by five percent due to third-party content and Xbox Game Pass.


Indeed, the company set a new fourth quarter record for monthly active Game Pass users and engagement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has reportedly cancelled its plans to release an Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel.


Word of a follow up to 2020's mythological romp first surfaced last year, when it was reported a game was in the pre-production stages, with Ubisoft hiring for the title. Subsequent reports then suggested this game would not, in fact, be a fully fledged sequel, but rather a spin-off with a Hawaiian Polynesian theme.


Now it seems the company has decided to pull the plug on this project all together. Sources familiar with Immortals Fenyx Rising's supposed sequel told VGC the Quebec studio's game is no longer in the works due to "perceived challenges around establishing the IP". Allegedly, Ubisoft instead wants to shift its focus to its "most prominent brands".

The upcoming Chrono Trigger inspired retro RPG from Sabotage Studio will launch on 29th August, when it will also be available on Xbox Game Pass, as well as Switch and PC. 


The impending launch of Sea of Stars on PlayStation Plus is notable, as Sony seldom releases games day one on its subscription service. To date, only a handful of other titles have been included as part of PS Plus on their release, such as Stray and Tchia. Meanwhile, the company has said it still won't put new first-party games on PlayStation Plus day one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has said negative comments from trolls online are "tiresome".


A special documentary on the developer was recently shown in Japan, which streamer and Final Fantasy fan Audrey of Aitai Kimochi translated for social media.


During the show, Yoshida stated he often checks social media for fan feedback during breaks between Final Fantasy 14 expansions and events. He was also shown watching fan videos ahead of the release of Final Fantasy 16 to understand fan sentiment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Bethesda remaining largely quiet about its upcoming space-opera, one excited Starfield fan has taken matters into their own hands and compiled a speculatory skill system for the game. 


As reported by GamesRadar, asd8dhd on Reddit has spent 200 hours trawling through the various gameplay clips, trailers, and other Starfild-focused media to create what they believe will be the game's complete skill tree.


"I must have watched the direct in its entirety around 50-60 times, often at ultra-slow speeds in order to capture specific details and verify certain information. I have also watched other videos and interviews many times, and have typed up enough notes to last me about 100 years," the Redditor shared along with their theories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Entertainment Software Rating Board has proposed a new verification mechanism which it says will ensure parental consent is properly obtained under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule (COPPA).

The board, which regulates age ratings for games in the US and Canada, has developed the mechanism with Yoti, a digital ID platform, and SuperAwesome, a company specialising in online child safety tools. SuperAwesome was acquired by Epic Games in 2020.

According to COPPA, services in the US must gain parental consent to collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The ERSB's proposal, titled "Privacy-Protective Facial Age Estimation", would use facial recognition software to verify the age of the parent. If their estimated age is lower than the threshold (given as 25 in the proposal), they would not be allowed to provide consent for the child.

The controller has four different designs - one for each of the titular turtles - but more importantly each will come with a "built-in scent diffuser" in the shape of a pizza slice.

Thankfully (or sadly, if you're a fan of TMNT and/or desire the constant smell of pizza in your life) the controller is only available through a giveaway being hosted by Xbox. In order to enter, you'll need to follow Xbox Game Pass on Twitter and retweet its sweepstakes tweet which, at time of writing, isn't live yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside the confirmation of which characters will appear in Mortal Kombat 1's first DLC, three more playable characters have been confirmed.
Long-time characters Baraka, Tanya, and Li Mei are all returning to the main roster of the reboot. Whilst Baraka was playable in the most recent game in the series, Mortal Kombat 11, Tanya last appeared as a playable character in Mortal Kombat 10 as DLC. Li Mei, despite appearing as a NPC in Mortal Kombat 10, hasn't been playable since 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.
Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has discussed some of the differences in these characters' stories in this rebooted universe.

"The goal for Steamforged was to seamlessly blend Voyage of Legends with the Sea of Thieves environment, making the game board, cards, and tokens feel at home on a tavern table in an outpost. The board game itself serves as a familiar hub where players can track their progress and house the various cards needed to become a pirate legend."

<p>It&#8217;s completely hypnotic to watch these tiny cells flash with color. It&#8217;s as if the squid has a little sky full of twinkling stars on its skin. This has to be one of the coolest looking sea creatures I&#8217;ve seen.</p></blockquote>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has commented on the sales of Final Fantasy 16, claiming they have been "extremely strong".


As previously reported, the PS5 exclusive sold 3m copies worldwide in under a week. However this sparked debate online in comparison to the company's previous two mainline Final Fantasy games: Final Fantasy 15 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake.



Square Enix has now issued a statement to IGN, pointing out the difference in install base between the PS4 and PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Epic Game Store's weekly freebies continue, this time pummelling the price of The Elder Scrolls Online and acclaimed puzzler Murder by Numbers down to an affordable zero pence.


The Elder Scrolls Online likely needs no introduction, not least because all the pertinent details are right there in the title. If you're still struggling though, it's an MMO - first released in 2014 - that whisks players to Tamriel for some fantasy japery.


If dragon nonsense isn't your thing, then your other option is Murder by Numbers, a lovely blend of campy detective mystery and - of all things - Picross, as players whizz back to the mid-90s in the role of Honor Mizhari, an actress on a hit TV detective show who's suddenly required to do some real-world investigating when her boss is found dead.

        <updated>2023-07-20T21:47:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly preparing to pause its upcoming in-house trial focussing on Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard, potentially paving the way for settlement talks between the various parties.


The FTC has long expressed opposition to Microsoft's proposed deal and sued to block its progress in December last year, claiming the acquisition would allow the company to suppress its games industry competition. The agency has more recently been in the news after it failed to secure an injunction preventing Microsoft from closing the deal while its in-house court deliberated whether the acquisition should be blocked.


Following that defeat, and a subsequent failed attempt to secure injunctive relief, the FTC is preparing to suspend its own trial - which was due to be heard by its in-house administrative court in August - in response to a request from Microsoft and Activision. Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the case, says the request must be granted after the FTC's unsuccessful federal court bid under the agency's own rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a first look back in May, Sony Pictures Entertainment has shared a second trailer offering another glimpse at its Neill Blomkamp directed Gran Turismo movie - which is almost upon us, launching in cinemas next month.


Sony's live-action Gran Turismo movie was announced in spring last year, as part of a string of reveals for upcoming PlayStation game adaptations, with others including a Horizon Zero Dawn series for Netflix and a God of War show for Amazon.


Since then, Neill Blomkamp (who directed District 9, Elysium, Chappie, and more) has signed up to helm the project - which dramatises the true story of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills put him on the path toward becoming a professional racecar driver - with the likes of Archie Madekwe, David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Geri Halliwell all joining the cast.

The emulator was first announced to be coming to Steam earlier this year, with the team behind it calling this a "product of many months of work".

However, a few months down the line, the team has dropped plans to launch Dolphin on Valve's platform. In a blog update detailing this decision, the Dolphin team addressed the recently-reported DMCA takedown, stating Nintendo "did not send Valve or Dolphin a Digital Millennium Copyright Act", nor has it "taken any legal action against Dolphin Emulator or Valve".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Sleep players with access to the game's £50 Pokémon Go Plus+ peripheral are pretending to sleep in order to quickly speed towards Pokémon Go rewards. 


The new nap-tracking app requires you record at least 90 minutes of sleep per day - and it's this minimum which users are now recording, before manually changing the date on their phones to then record another 90 minutes, and so forth. 


Repeating this method allows you to rack up rewards for recording a week's worth of sleep (albeit no less than 90 minutes at a time) in just a few hours, users writing on Pokémon fan reddit TheSilphRoad say. And doing so seems fairly straightforward, with the app's sleep sensor simply turned off and on without you actually having to be asleep.

A free-to-play hero shooter set in the world of the popular anime, Gundam Evolution arrived on Steam last September, with a console version then following in December. 


However, Gundam Evolution evidently hasn't taken off in the way the developer had hoped, with Bandai Namco Online now announcing its service will end on 29th November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Patrick's Parabox, the indie recursive puzzle game, will launch on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 next week on 26th July.
Despite scooping the prize for Excellence in Design at the Independent Games Festival in 2020, the game made a relatively small splash when it first released last year for PC.
Patrick's Parabox is a sokoban mixed with recursion, filled with boxes inside of boxes. You play as Patrick, a small box, and you push around boxes to where they need to go. Sometimes, you push around boxes which contain the puzzle you're actually in, and then you can enter that box. The trailer below probably sums it up better than I could in words.

<blockquote><p>So far, at least three trends emerge:</p>
<p>First, the plan contains a (somewhat) more concrete list of actions than its parent strategy, with useful delineation of lead and supporting agencies, as well as timelines aplenty. By assigning each action a designated lead and timeline, and by including a new nominal section (6) focused entirely on assessing effectiveness and continued iteration, the ONCD suggests that this is not so much a standalone text as the framework for an annual, crucially iterative policy process. That many of the milestones are still hazy might be less important than the commitment. the administration has made to revisit this plan annually, allowing the ONCD team to leverage their unique combination of topical depth and budgetary review authority...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 recently made headlines when it was reported the game would have 17,000 ending variations. It's a claim that comes from an interview with one of the game's lead writers by YouTuber Fextralife, and related specifically to the differences which might flavour the more general core paths to the game's ending.


Lead writer Adam Smith has now shed further light on these variations, and further confirmed they don't  equate to endgame states. Rather, Baldur's Gate 3's narrative should be thought of as a "big spider web", he said, with the endgame in the centre. 


"It's not that you start at point A, and then you keep branching and branching and branching," Smith explained to GamesRadar. "That's often how people think of it, but the problem with that would be that if I make a choice, then I branch over here, and suddenly I'm over here and I can't get back [to the trunk]."

Subscriptions were up by 5.9m since March, BBC News reported, presenting a far rosier picture than the losses faced this time last year.


In a statement, Netflix said it had seen a "healthy conversion of borrower households" into paid accounts, and that the number of account cancellations in protest at the changes had been low.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard's latest financial earnings report has arrived, and while it's good news for the company as a whole, Blizzard in particular has had a stellar quarter, surpassing $1bn USD in net bookings for the first time ever thanks to the launch of Diablo 4.


In its second quarter earnings report for the latest financial year, Activision Blizzard announced 50% year-over-year growth in net bookings, with the company amassing $2.46bn compared to the $1.64bn it reported in the second quarter of 2022.


That's down to a mix of increased "player investment in live operations content" across games such as Call of Duty, which rose by 17%, and "another quarterly net bookings record at King". The big applause, though, is reserved for Diablo 4, which, as of the end of Blizzard's record-breaking second quarter - which saw the studio's segment revenue grow by 160% year-over-year and its operating revenue more than triple - has "sold-through more units than any other Blizzard title at an equivalent stage of release."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard is taking its first tentative steps away from Battle.net exclusivity, starting with the launch of Overwatch 2 on Steam this August and the promise of more games on the way.


Battle.net has been at the core of Blizzard's games since its release back in 1996, and the studio's PC titles have remained exclusively available through the platform in the years since, making it one of the few companies to have entirely snubbed Steam.


That will change on 10th August when Blizzard's free-to-play shooter sequel Overwatch 2 arrives on Valve's storefront, where it'll incorporate native features including Steam Achievements and Steam friends list integration. And perhaps we might even see official Steam Deck support on the way? Blizzard does note, however, that players will still be required to connect the game to a Battle.net account to enable features including cross-platform play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of Sonic Boom. I know, that might be controversial. Sonic fans have long debated which Sonic CD soundtrack is best between the Japanese and American releases. 


For the opening at least, I've always loved the American version: Sonic Boom. The chugging electric guitars! The earworm vocal harmonies! The key shift from verse to chorus! Japan's You Can Do Anything is a funky 90s bop that just sounds inherently Sonic, while Sonic Boom set the tone for the later rock-heavy Sonic Adventure games. I prefer that classic 90s sound overall but something about "Sonic boooom Sonic boooom" gets me so excited for another high-speed adventure - what can I say, I like the cheese.


All of which is to say, I love the Sonic animation intros. And the just-released intro for Sega's forthcoming Sonic Superstars is hitting all the right notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Supreme Court has denied the latest effort by a group of gamers to block Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition. 


In December last year, a group of 10 gamers teamed up to file a federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. The case aimed to argue that Microsoft's acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision would "foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition".


In March, a judge dismissed the "so-called gamers' lawsuit" on the grounds it did not "plausibly allege the merger creates a reasonable probability of anticompetitive effects in any relevant market".

Scrolling through the hefty patch notes there are a number of buffs and debuffs across all classes, but the biggest impact is on the Sorcerer that's been nerfed.


That's due to a reduction in bonus damage for the Devouring Blaze skill, a popular choice for many playing as that class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Sleep, the new Pokémon-themed sleep tracker app for iOS and Android, is now available to download in Europe.


It's been something of a long road to Pokémon Sleep's release - the app was first announced back in 2019, when it was expected to launch the following year - but it's now finally here, giving users tools to track the length and quality of their sleep, and - crucially, given it's the whole hook of the thing - gather in-game Pokémon based on the success of their slumber.


Depending on the categories of sleep players manage to achieve during their downtime - "dozing", "snoozing" or "slumbering", for instance - they're able to attract different sets of Pokémon, and the whole process is overseen by new Pokémon professor, Neroli.

In the latest instalment of Nintendo's Ask The Developer series of interviews, Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto spoke alongside former series directors Shigefumi Hino and Masamichi Abe, as well as programmer Yuji Kando and designer Junji Morii on the origins of the series. 
Hino revealed initially the team had planned to feature creatures with AI chips in their heads in the first Pikmin game, and players would be able to control them by assigning different chips. The concept art for this prototype was shown, and the early Pikmin would have looked like round creatures with limbs, a nose, eyes, and an antenna.

<blockquote><p>The group got the idea for the conings by chance. The person claims a few of them walking together one night saw a cone on the hood of an AV, which appeared disabled. They weren&#8217;t sure at the time which came first; perhaps someone had placed the cone on the AV&#8217;s hood to signify it was disabled rather than the other way around. But, it gave them an idea, and when they tested it, they found that a cone on a hood renders the vehicles little more than a multi-ton hunk of useless metal. The group suspects the cone partially blocks the LIDAR detectors on the roof of the car, in much the same way that a human driver wouldn&#8217;t be able to safely drive with a cone on the hood. But there is no human inside to get out and simply remove the cone, so the car is stuck...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Datamined details of an upcoming boss encounter scooped up by Wowhead reveal the abilities of a new "Renegade Looter" enemy to include "Cranking 90s", "One Pump", "Slurp Drink" and "Disco Bomb". For the uninitiated, all of these are references to Epic Games' ever-popular battle royale. 


Cranking 90s, for example, refers to the player ability to build a vertical tower at speed. In World of Warcraft, it will allow the Renegade Looter boss to "rapidly construct a tower to gain the high ground".

Barone confirmed the update was in development back in June 2022, though at the time described it as largely a "modding-focused update". While suggesting update 1.6 will have some new content, Barone was clear it would not have as much as 1.5, added back in December 2020.

Now, Barone has shared a fresh update on what's coming to Stardew Valley in 1.6 that sounds more promising - prompting excitment from fans at what's in store.

However, following the US Federal Trade Commission's failure to secure a temporarily halt on the deal in court last week, the CMA indicated it would be open to a "new merger investigation" if Microsoft was willing to restructure its Activision Blizzard deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 developer Starbreeze Studios has released a new trailer showcasing its upcoming heist shooter's stealth gameplay. Unfortunately, it released it so sneakily, it went undiscovered for five days and the studio ended up having to tell everyone where it'd hidden it.


In a moment of perhaps misguided whimsy, someone at Starbreeze (thanks PC Gamer) thought it would be a fun idea to hide its new trailer in appropriately stealthy fashion by squirrelling it behind the existing trailer on the Payday 3 website - so that it only popped into view when the volume slider was turned all the way down or when the site was visited in Incognito mode.


Starbreeze began to realise it might have been a bit too sneaky when, some five days later, the trailer still lay undiscovered. And so - after an initial, ultimately failed prompt on Twitter - the studio turned, somewhat inexplicably, to the medium of exceptionally bad poetry in a desperate bid to nudge fans in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Codename Jade, the Ancient China-set free-to-play mobile game from Tencent's  Level Infinite, will start its first closed beta on 3rd August, Ubisoft has confirmed.


Announced last September, Codename Jade is a fully fledged open-world Assassin's Creed game set in second century BC China (placing it chronologically between Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Origins) and featuring the Qin dynasty.


Players create their own character - the adopted child of master Wei Yu - in Codename Jade, eventually embarking on a quest for revenge after their close friend is betrayed. "But as they delve deeper into their mission," Ubisoft teases, "they will uncover secrets about the past and a powerful force that threatens to destroy everything they hold dear."

More specifically, developer Mediatonic's knockabout free-to-play battle royale game welcomes Death Stranding protagonist Sam Porter Bridges into its heaving dayglo bean orgy in the guise of a new costume styled after the Standard-Issue Bridges SDT Suit.


It features exactly the kind of gear you'd want if you had plans to march through rain capable of instantly withering you into an aged husk, complete with Odradek Terrain Scanner, and your very own Bridge-Baby-in-a-jar which is also bean shaped, naturally.

In the case of Venba, it's both. If you've played the demo, the care and attention to detail of the game's opening level is clear. Now I've seen more, courtesy of a preview presentation and roundtable interview with game designer and creative director Abhi. I came away appreciating how Venba wears its heart on its sleeve, regardless of whether or not you pick up on every single reference.

Venba takes place across three decades, and follows the story of a couple - Venba and her husband Paavalan - after they've emigrated from South India to Canada. Venba touches on themes of immigration, family, culture and assimilation, and food is the language it uses to navigate these conversations.

This comes as part of new regulation laid out by the Council of the European Union which aims to "regulate the entire life cycle of batteries" to ensure they are "safe, sustainable and competitive". 


The idea is batteries are easier to replace and recycle, with a guarantee that "portable batteries incorporated into appliances should be removable and replaceable by the end-user" within new devices from 2027 onwards.

"Of course we have to do new things, but not all IPs are the same for new releases and reboots," Sugino said, according to Google Translate and my rusty GCSE Japanese.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Fortress 2 has beaten its own concurrent user record, clocking up 258,997 players earlier this week.

Whilst that may not sound impressive given the PUBG: Battlegrounds' record-breaking peak currently sits at a hefty 3.2m players, it's important to note that even though TF2 is widely considered one of the greatest shooters of all time, it's just about to turn 16 years old.

According to SteamDB, the game has never been more popular, not even when it switched from a premium to a free-to-play model in 2011. And the most recent record of 253,997 concurrent players more than doubles the prior record of 167,591, which was set back in December 2022.

When asked if Payday 3 will have "an offline mode, like playing solo", Almir replied: "No. You will be able to play it by yourself, but I do believe you will have to have a connection in order to play because it's made in the Unreal Engine, it's using cross-progression, [and] cross-play. I do believe we need you to be online."

"I know this isn't what any Starfield fan wants to hear from me, but I feel like I need to make this clear: no one other than Todd Howard himself is authorised to talk publicly about unreleased game info. That's the job of of our PR/marketing/community folks," Pagliarulo said in the thread, which was also shared with the game's subreddit.

Nichiporchik (as reported by WhyNowGaming) was speaking at this week's Develop: Brighton conference, in a talk titled 'AI in Gamedev: Is My Job Safe?' which promised an "in-depth [look] into how [TinyBuild] adopted AI in daily practices to exponentially increase efficiency".


One part of the presentation in particular, focusing on "AI for HR", has proved especially contentious since news of its contents began to spread around the internet. Here, Nichiporchik discussed how AI could be used by HR to spot burnout (later described as being synonymous with "toxicity") among employees by first identifying "potential problematic team members" then collating and running their Slack messages and automatic transcriptions from the likes of Google Meet and Zoom through Chat GPT, in a process he terms "I, Me Analysis".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever had the overwhelming desire to feel exactly what it would be like to shimmy up a wall in 9th-century Baghdad, help is at hand; a company has just announced a "haptic gaming suit" that'll be compatible with - and themed around - the upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage.


Haptics firm Owo's Mirage-themed tie-in has been created in partnership with Ubisoft and looks something like an extremely snug short-sleeved shirt, albeit packaged alongside various bits of hardware. While wearing one, players can experience "multiple different sensations" that reflect those of Assasson's Creed Mirage's protagonist Basim.


Owo says these "sensations" will include the likes of "impacts and parkour", with the standard version of the haptic suit able to mimic 30 different sensations, including "axe", "insect bites", "severe abdominal wound", and "ball".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larry "Major Nelson" Hryb, long one of the most recognisable presences on the Xbox team, has announced his departure from Microsoft after 22 years.


Hryb has been with Microsoft since early 2001, initially serving as editor-in-chief for MSN Music before joining the company's Xbox division two years later. As a senior product manager for Xbox, Hryb was focused on helping shape the Xbox Live community experience - he credits himself as being a key contributor in features such as Xbox's Achievement system and party chat - and would go on to become senior director of corporate communications in 2012.


Over the years, Major Nelson - a name derived form Hryb's Gamertag - has been something of a figurehead for Xbox, relaying Xbox-Live-related information to the community and having a prominent presence in its various community focused blogs, livestreams, podcasts, and shows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari's 1979 arcade classic Lunar Lander is being reimagined by Dreams Uncorporated, the studio behind last year's striking Cris Tales, for release in early 2024.


The original Lunar Lander (perhaps the most famous entry in a sub-genre that can be traced back as far as 1969) was exquisite in its compelling simplicity, requiring players to do nothing more than carefully park their lunar landing module at a fixed point on the Moon's rugged terrain - by manipulating their craft's thrusters and controlling its orientation.


Dream Uncorporated's reimagining, though, which will be known as Lunar Lander: Beyond, is looking to do something a little bit different, taking the moon landing premise of the arcade original and infusing it with a "rich back story" and "deep narrative". There's also talk of "simulation" and "precision gravity flier mechanics" in the studio's announcement.

miHoYo's statement to Eurogamer suggests it is only learning of the situation now, and that the missing payments were the fault of a local recording studio which it has now "immediately urged" to sort the situation. 

Indeed, miHoYo says it is now "also seeking alternative solutions" to resolve the matter - and presumably make sure it never happens again.

A new trailer for the game was shown at the recent Annapurna Showcase, but with its abstract aesthetic it's difficult to ascertain exactly how the game will play.



That was intentional, however. "We aim to try to raise questions, instead of answering them," said game director Simon Flesser. "We want to make viewers wonder, and think."

There were a few questionable faces in there, admittedly, with Brazilian Womens' legend Miranda looking quietly terrifying up in the top left, and Ronaldino not quite at his best, but the biggest standout was Andrea Pirlo, the iconic now-retired Italian holding midfielder. 


Pirlo looks especially out of place because unlike everyone else in the group shot, he's just wearing a plain, unbranded blue t-shirt amongst a sea of official kits. He's also staring blankly into space, leading to plenty of comments joking he looked a little lost.

Xbox's Tim Stuart said Microsoft had forecasted PlayStation sales in order to evaluate the impact of making ZeniMax games exclusive. Ultimately, the company believed it could "offset losses incurred from making ZeniMax games exclusive through Game Pass and increased console sales".

As such, the CMA will take another six weeks to consider the new submission, with this revised period ending 29th August.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has seen its initial appeal against this week's Microsoft and Activision Blizzard ruling promptly denied. 


US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, who presided over the main case, rejected the FTC's call for an appeal late last night. 


With this avenue now closed, the FTC has subsequently launched a new push for a "temporary pause" on Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, Reuters has reported, this time with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is, alas, almost time to bid a fond farewell to Henry Cavill's stoically sweary take on Geralt of Rivia in Netflix's The Witcher adaptation. He'll be hanging up his sword and locks of white in the show's upcoming Season 3 Volume 2, which Netlix is now teasing in a newly released trailer.


Season 3 of Netflix's wonky The Witcher adaptation kicked off with five new episodes at the end of June, and it'll come to a close with the release of three more episodes on 27th July.


And as for what's in store, lots of special effects, overwrought emotion, and a whole heap of action judging by Netflix's new Volume 2 trailer, which also manages to chuck in a unicorn and far too much of Jaskier's terrible Season 3 haircut for my liking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After developer Larian shifted the release date of Baldur's Gate 3 forward a month to avoid clashing with Bethesda's highly anticipated Starfield, Dragon Age creator David Gaider's roleplaying musical Stray Gods is now moving back a week to avoid Baldur's Gate 3.


Stray Gods (subtitled The Roleplaying Musical for the benefit of those with leaky genre brain) was originally due to launch on 3rd August, but Summerfall Studios - where Gaider is co-founder and creative director - has now revised its release date to 10th August, explaining, "We want everyone to have ample space to check out Stray Gods when it launches. Baldur’s Gate 3 is hotly anticipated (by us, too!) and we want to give our fans room to celebrate Stray Gods."


However, it seems Larian's fantasy epic isn't the only reason for Stray Gods' short delay; Summerfall calls releasing the game across Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC simultaneously a "huge undertaking for any team, let alone an indie shipping its first title" and says the extra week "allows us to have performance parity as close as possible - across every platform."

As spotted by Insider Gaming, actor and singer Luke Charles Stafford recently shared a post on Facebook claiming Activision would be using his likeness for "their next main character" in a Call of Duty apparently set to release "next year".


"Activision decided to adapt their next main character, 'Ratcliffe' for Call of Duty off my face/likeness, and I am elated," Stafford wrote. "To all of my college roommate back at Anderson University and those years in Smith Hall Playing Black Ops 2... Next year, we can beat the snot out of each other again, but I want to play as me."

EA Sports FC24 is, of course, EA's first major football outing without the FIFA brand, which the publisher announced it was ditching last May. Since then, we've been introduced to EA Sports FC's official logo (it's a triangle made of letters with a triangle in it), and, more recently, had a reveal for the game's premium-priced Ultimate Edition cover. Which was a tad unsettling.


Today, though, it's all go on the EA Sports FC24 news front, as EA aimed to convince of its continuing place in football with a flashy, no-expenses-spared showcase featuring the likes Alex Scott, Didier Drogba, Luís Figo, Ronaldinho, Leah Williams, and Erling Haaland - who'll feature on the cover of EA Sports FC24's Standard Edition.

The latest line of Pikmin merch on the UK and Ireland website for My Nintendo Store comes in the form of bud vases, a vase for a single flower, in the shape of Pikmin.
It's an adorable idea, as you can put a leaf, bud, or open flower in to make the Pikmin look how they do in-game. You can even branch out and put different varieties of flowers in, taking some inspiration from the mobile Pokémon Go-like game Pikmin Bloom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, the next game from Life is Strange and Vampyr developer Dontnod, will release on 7th November.
Banishers was unveiled in December last year, and is a supernatural action RPG which follows the story of ghost-hunters (and lovers) Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith. The pair go to New Eden, a community being haunted by spirits, where Antea becomes a spirit herself. 
Today, Dont Nod has announced a release date along with a new trailer which gives a few more hints about the game's plot. The video below shows the perspective of Charles Davenport, a friend of the protagonists who seems to blame himself for what has happened to them.

Last year, one of Bungie's community managers shared artwork by UhMaayyze, who is described as a "talented Black fan and creator of Destiny 2 fan works", as a part of Bungie's 'My Destiny 2 Story' series.


Following this artwork's appearance, a Destiny 2 player took it upon themselves to begin a campaign of racist, stochastic terrorism against the community manager who highlighted UhMaayyze's work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch recently unveiled its new Partner Plus programme that offers an improved revenue split, but streamers have now described to Eurogamer it as "anti-community".


The programme was announced last month for launch in October, and is set to offer a 70/30 revenue split - higher than the usual 50/50 between streamers and Twitch. However, the criteria for this higher revenue split is very specific, meaning few streamers will likely reach the necessary requirements.



Speaking to Eurogamer at TwitchCon Paris, many Twitch Partners criticised the programme and stated its threshold was unattainable.

Following months of legal wrangling a US judge cleared the way for Microsoft to complete its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, after deciding the FTC had not sufficiently proven why it should be blocked. 


The FTC, as had been expected, is now appealing this decision - and has already filed to begin the process as quickly as possible.

In better news, its long-promised closed beta begins later this month.


Solar Crown - which ambitiously promises a full digital recreation of Hong Kong Island and its 550km of roads to recklessly careern around - got its official unveiling back in 2020, and was originally expected to launch across all platforms in September last year.


However, as May 2022 rolled around, publisher Nacon announced it was shifting Solar Crown's release back to some undisclosed point in 2023, and confirmed it was ceasing development of the previously announced PS4 and Xbox One versions "with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles and maximising the overall quality of the game".

Reports that Roblox was coming to Meta Quest first surfaced earlier this year, when sources told The Verge the move would likely happen toward the end of 2023. It now seems those estimates were a little off; today's confirmation of incoming Meta Quest support doesn't provide an exact launch date, but it does reveal an open beta will be added to Meta Quest's App Lab "soon".


In an official announcement on the Roblox developer forum, the company explained, "Traditionally, developing a VR experience required a team that had VR-specific experience and skills. With Roblox, developers will soon be able to publish their existing experiences to support VR with little to no additional coding effort required. This is because Roblox is designed to be universal, allowing the same experiences to run everywhere."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed its next batch of Game Catalogue additions for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, which, as of 18th July, will include the likes of It Takes Two, Undertale, World War Z, The Ascent, and - for Premium retro fans - Twisted Metal 1 and 2.


It Takes Two (PS4, PS5) is one of July's big draws, serving up some acclaimed co-op platform action as Cody and May, two parents-turned-toys on the edge of a divorce, must battle against the odds to return to the real-world. The Game Catalogue version includes a Friend's Pass, meaning someone who has the game can invite a friend who doesn't to play for free.


It's joined by Neon Giant's absolutely gorgeous top-down cyberpunk action-shooter RPG The Ascent (PS4, PS5); Saber Interactive's well-received four-play co-op zombie slayer World War Z (PS4, PS5); Toby Fox's cult favourite RPG Undertale (PS4); extreme off-road action in SnowRunner (PS4, PS5), and long-distance tactical blasting in Sniper Elite 5 (PS4, PS5).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA's 2005 open-world racer Need for Speed: Most Wanted could be getting the remake treatment if a recent post from a voice actor on the original game proves to be accurate.


Word of a remake for Need for Speed: Most Wanted comes via <a href="https://twitter.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1679059692981747712
">now-deleted Instagram and Twitter posts (as spotted over on the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit) from actor Simone Bailly who - alongside various television appearances over the years in the likes of Stargate SG-1 and The L Word - played Officer Turf in the original 2005 game.


According to Bailly, a "Need for Speed: Most Wanted Remake is being release in 2024", and we can surmise it's a new version of EA Vancouver's 2005 original rather than developer Criterion Games' 2012 racer of the same name, as Bailly says she'll once again be starring as the "partner" of protagonist Sergeant Jonathan Cross.

Chatting at Develop:Brighton earlier today, studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said Guerrilla faced technical challenges when developing the Zero Dawn sequel, as it was releasing across two generations of consoles. 


"It was almost up until the last moment that we didn't know whether we could support the flying on PlayStation 4," the developer said (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). "We were like, 'Do we need to cut the whole feature of the game? That's going to make such a mess'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to this week's milestone court decision which clears the way for Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal in the US, and potentially in the UK as well.

We discuss why the court sided with Microsoft and what is likely to happen next, including what remedies Microsoft may be considering to get the deal over the line with the UK as well. Could we see a future where the UK lacks Call of Duty streaming on Game Pass? Or any form of streaming via Game Pass altogether?
Finally, we ponder the games industry's next steps in general. Will the sale of Activision Blizzard further open the floodgates to yet more acquisitions? And how will Sony counter? Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

The CMA has remained an outlier in Microsoft's ongoing bid to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard, being one of the only bodies to oppose the deal. 


In April, the CMA cited concerns over the deal's proposed impact on the cloud gaming sector as its reason for blocking the acquisition, stating Microsoft's ownership of Activision Blizzard risked "stifling competition in this growing market".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's currently a question mark hanging over the Xbox versions of Baldur's Gate 3. They are happening but they're held up by Xbox Series S, which is struggling to run split-screen co-op at an acceptable performance standard.
An added complication is that Microsoft wants feature parity across the Series X and S versions of the games - so much so there's a suggestion Larian would not be able to release one Xbox version of Baldur's Gate 3 with split-screen co-op, and the other without it.
The last we heard from Larian was that it was working on it, and that it was weighing up some "compromises" - the suggestion being that split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S could, potentially, be removed. So when I spoke to Larian boss Swen Vincke about this last week, I asked whether a decision had yet been made.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly "leaning toward" an appeal of yesterday's decisive court verdict that cleared the way for Microsoft to complete its Activision Blizzard acquisition in the US.


A Bloomberg report states that the FTC currently favours launching an appeal, but has just days to do so.


Microsoft cannot close the deal in the US before Friday this week, while the deal itself is set to expire next Tuesday, 18th July. It's therefore expected Microsoft will act swiftly, and seek to complete the acquisition once and for all this coming Monday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Craig Mazin, writer and showrunner on HBO's smash hit The Last of Us TV adaptation (and creator of HBO and Sky Atlantic's acclaimed prestige drama Chernobyl), has removed his name from Gearbox's long-in-the-works Borderlands movie amid what appears to be an increasingly tumultuous post-production period for the project.


A Borderlands movie was first announced back in 2015, but it wasn't until five years later, when Gearbox announced Hostel director Eli Roth would be directing from a script by Mazin, that the project finally appeared to be moving forward in earnest.


Things progressed quickly after Roth and Mazin's involvement was confirmed, with a succession of major acting talent - including the likes Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jack Black - all signing up to join the star-studded cast prior to the start of shooting in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Eclipse, the studio behind last year's acclaimed Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, has announced it's giving a similar "interactive documentary" treatment to Prince of Persia designer Jordan Mechner's 1984 classic Karateka later this year on Xbox and PC - as part of a new series of releases, each one focusing on a different seminal game.


Things kick off with The Making of Karateka, a historical delve into Mechner's noted martial arts game that'll combine interviews, video, design documents, audio, and photos to create what the studio is calling the "deepest, most exhaustive exploration of the making of a single video game that's ever been attempted in a video game itself."


"In The Making of Karateka," the studio explains on Xbox Wire, "you'll meet Jordan Mechner - not the legendary veteran game designer we know today, but the unknown teenage college student who was desperate to break into the video game business. Through excerpts from his college journals, galleries of his design documents, and all-new video interviews, you'll share Jordan’s struggles and triumphs as he creates a video game like no one had ever seen before."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years (well, one year and 11 months to be more precise) after its debut on Switch, PlayStation and PC, Axiom Verge 2 - the sequel to developer Thomas Happ's acclaimed retro-styled Metroid-a-like - is finally available for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.


Axiom Verge 2 builds on its 2015 predecessor's exploratory action with a quest to "discover the origins of the Axiom Verge universe", beginning as new protagonist (and billionaire owner of the Globe 3 conglomerate) Indra heads to Antarctica in search of her daughter.


Here, Indra discovers a portal to an entirely different reality - a ruined Earth-like world infected by parasitic machines - that she'll need to explore and overcome, battling deadly monsters along the way with her melee-focused abilities if she wants to survive.

Hellboy Web of Wyrd was formally announced last December, teasing an original storyline crafted in collaboration with series creator Mike Mignola, as well as a striking aesthetic designed to evoke the visuals and atmosphere of the comics.


While specifics still remain relatively sparse some six months on, we do known it'll take place in The Butterfly House, a strange residence built upon "occult ley-energies" whose many doorways lead to a "terrible and fascinating" dimension known as The Wyrd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has won its crucial court case against the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), clearing its way to acquire Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn.

Last week's courtroom battle hinged on whether the FTC could be allowed an injunction to temporarily block the deal while it investigated further. But in reality the case was viewed as a referendum on the deal's overall ability to still be successful.
Defeat in court would have left Microsoft's effort to buy the publisher behind World of Warcraft, Diablo 4 and Candy Crush dead in the water, Microsoft had previously admitted.

Twitch created a team of LGBT+ streamers from the UK and Ireland who were added to a specific Pride Month "shelf" on the front page during the month of June, though this was located beneath other recommendation feeds and lacked promotion on social media.


Speaking to Eurogamer at TwitchCon Paris, members of this team stated it wasn't beneficial and would like to see Twitch improve its support for LGBT+ streamers not just during Pride Month but throughout the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study conducted by the Video Game History Foundation and the Software Preservation Network has revealed that 87 percent of classic games released in the US are out of print.

The remaining 13 percent can be easily accessed - whether that's through a re-release on modern platforms or through an officially provided emulation service, but the majority of older games remain unavailable through easy means.

The study was produced in order to substantiate the amount of video game history in danger of being lost, the Video Game History Foundation said, and provide evidence on why libraries and archives should be allowed to preserve games in a similar way to other media forms such as books and films.

Wrote Larian in a community update: "Baldur's Gate 3 has more cinematic dialogue than three times all three Lord of the Rings novels combined. It has 174 hours of cinematics, making it more than twice the length of every season of Game of Thrones combined."
This, however, raised concerns over how much cinematic dialogue people would be watching while playing the game, and whether it would interrupt the flow.

Earlier this year, Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4 required players to create new characters each season. This sparked debate across the board, with many believing the decision would leave a sour taste in the mouths of Diablo 4's more casual players. 


But while controversial, this move is similar to how seasonal content worked in Diablo 2's ladders and Diablo 3's seasons. Diablo 3 did have something else going for it, however - the Rebirth feature.

A "supermajority" of 144 employees spread across marketing, localisation, product development, and quality assurance at Sega of America revealed its intention to unionise back in April, with the aim of securing higher base pay, improving benefits, and more.


At the time, the group confirmed it had contacted the National Labor Relations Board in order to file for an election, to which Sega management were said to be "investigating and considering the options available". That election has now taken place, with 91 employees voting yes and 26 voting no out of 200+ eligible employees.

This isn't our first glimpse at the Twisted Metal TV series, of course; April offered a brisk introduction to Anthony Mackie's "motor-mouthed outsider" protagonist and the tiniest tease of iconic villain Sweet Tooth (voiced by Will Arnett and played by Samoa Joe), while June showed the pair exchanging quips and violence in a follow-up clip.


And now, with launch day in sight, Peacock has released a considerably more wide-ranging looking at the action fans can expect. There are cars! Guns! Cars being shot at with guns in a shopping mall! We get a peek at post-apocalyptic San Francisco, and the rather more gnarly post-apocalypse beyond the city's walls, plus a look at Neve Campbell as Raven and Thomas Haden Church in the role of Agent Stone.

Moore said he has "always" described Clockwork Revolution as a mix of the two, due to its "deep world building, compelling narrative, crunchy RPG systems, engaging gameplay, and massive reactivity," on Twitter.

Moore's credits include both Arcanum and Bloodlines, as he was a lead artist and designer at developer Troika Games from 1999 to 2004. On his website, Moore states he was involved in narrative, content, and character design for both games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bokeh Game Studio has given us a fresh look at its upcoming horror-but-not-too-horror game, Slitterhead.

In an all-new developer diary posted to YouTube (see below), Bokeh revealed new details about its inaugural title, including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities, and – surprise! – the ability to play as a dog.

Given "early development footage" is stamped across all snippets of gameplay and most of the action comes from early tests, it's safe to presume that development has moved on since this footage was captured, but nonetheless, it provides a tantalising glimpse at what's in store.

<blockquote><p>A mysterious squid-like cosmic cloud, this nebula is very faint, but also very large in planet Earth&#8217;s sky. In the image, composed with 30 hours of narrowband image data, it spans nearly three full moons toward the royal constellation Cepheus. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula&#8217;s bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue-green emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, a more recent investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<p>Everyone is talking about these new AI technologies&#8212;like ChatGPT&#8212;and AI companies are touting their awesome power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released a new trailer for Pikmin 4, ahead of its release in a couple of weeks.

The video is a short primer on what the titular Pikmin are and how they can be used in-game. The overview follows a new traveller as they meet the Pikmin and learn how to work with them.

The traveller looks on in confusion at various points, before a Pikmin confidently approaches them and instructs them to blow their whistle, or launch it towards a task to do, which got a chuckle out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yuji Naka, Sonic's co-creator and the man behind ill-fated platformer Balan Wonderworld, has been found guilty of insider trading, but will avoid prison for now.


Naka was first arrested back in November 2022 following reports of alleged insider trading at Square Enix. He pleaded guilty in March, and then, in June, the developer was sentenced to serve two and a half years in jail, with a final judgement in July.


At this time, Naka was additionally fined twice for ¥2.5m and ¥170m (just under £1m total), with his defence seeking a suspended sentence and to lower the fines. They claimed Naka "accidentally saw information that was extremely unrelated to [his] work". However, prosecutors said Naka "showed no signs of remorse" for his actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4's first season will go live on 20th July, with the promise of a new boss battle, questline and gear to get your hands on. 


Known as Season of the Malignant, this season will introduce the fittingly named Malignant Monsters. These monsters are described by Blizzard as "decaying abominations" that roam through Sanctuary in a frenzy. They will not hesitate to attack anyone or anything that gets in their way. 


A new questline will focus on sorting these new foes out, with Cormond, a former priest of the Cathedral of Light, helping you on your way. He will train you to "capture the Malignant hearts" that are the source of the monsters' power, and "convert them into build-altering powers".

Not including today's announcements, NetherRealm has so-far confirmed a total of 10 playable characters for Mortal Kombat 1: Johnny Cage, Kenshi, Kitana, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Mileena, Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung (available via pre-order), and Sub-Zero.


Two more additions have now been revealed as part of NetherRealm's latest Kombat Kast livestream. Assassin-turned-cyborg Smoke is in, marking his first playable appearance in the main series since 2011's Mortal Kombat reboot. He's joined by moody demi-god Rain, who hasn't been benched quite so long, having appeared in Mortal Kombat 11 as a DLC character.

Speaking to GameReactor at the recent Gamelab conference in Barcelona, Molyneux was reluctant to give many firm details of the game or this idea to avoid - in his words - people subsequently getting "very annoyed and angry" when their expectations of Molyneux's words are met with reality.


"In days gone by, I would just start telling you about the whole game and the whole game design and why it was going to be the most brilliant game in the world," Molyneux said. "I'm not going to do that."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol has joined PlayStation Plus Premium's ever-expanding trials programme - good news indeed for those yet to try the space horror game.


You can now play the game for one hour, which will give you a little taster of what's in store for protagonist Jacob Lee as he negotiates the perils of the galactic prison facility he finds himself in on Jovian moon Callisto.


It is a shorter trial than previous PlayStation Plus offerings, with the likes of God of War Ragnarök giving players three hours of gameplay, but still a nice addition to the service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashback, the classic 16-bit sci-fi platformer from Delphine Software, is, as you probably already know, getting a sequel before the end of 2023, some 31 years after its original release. And new developer Microids has now offered a fresh look at Flashback 2's action - specifically the jungle-y bits - in a new trailer as it prepares for a November release.


The original Flashback, which arrived to much acclaim back in 1992 - when everything was still in black and white, and computers were powered by magic - followed the far-flung future adventures of agent Conrad B. Hart on the trail of shapeshifting aliens attempting to infiltrate human society. It was an investigation that, much like Delphine's earlier Another World, took the form of a strikingly rotoscoped platform-puzzler.


Flashback 2 (which, somewhat confusingly, isn't technically the game's first sequel, given the existence of 1995's 3D follow-up Fade to Black) sees Conrad B. Hart return for more sci-fi adventure - somewhere in the 22nd century - as he goes in search of his friend Ian. Again.

Gun announced an end for Friday the 13th: The Game back in June, confirming the asymmetrical multiplayer horror would be pulled from stores on 31st December this year, the same day its Friday the 13th licence officially expires. There's some small solace for owners, however, in that the studio has promised the game will remain playable through "at least" 31st December 2024.


And now, it's announced some new measures that, while primarily designed to "reduce the dependence on database servers", will also allow players to go about their merry slaughtering and killer-evading survival in chaotically maxed-out fashion.

And now, thanks to a new leak, we've got a good idea of when EA Sports FC will likley be showing up - which, unsurprisingly, is pretty much slap bang in the same late-September slot FIFA has occupied for the last few years.


According to data miner billbil-kun - who has a amassed a pretty compelling back catalogue of accurate calls when it comes to video game leaks (Sony's monthly PlayStation Plus line-up being a particular specialty) - EA Sports FC will release on 29th September this year.


Given that FIFA 2023 and the series entry before it both launched on 27th September in their respective release years, it's hardly a huge surprise to learn EA's new FIFA-in-all-but-name game will follow suit, but it does give us an intriguing window to watch as we prepare to see how EA Sports FC will fair without its familiar branding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage will include an interactive history feature available in the game at launch, allowing you to delve deeper into the real world version of the game's Baghdad setting. 


This option appears to be an alternative to the more involved Discovery Tour mode that popped up some time post-launch in Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. Perhaps befitting Mirage's more condensed nature, this option too sounds less involved.


Appropriately titled the "History of Baghdad", the option is described as being similar to the series' traditional Codex, and has been built in partnership with a series of museums and international historical institutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Destiny hurtles towards the conclusion of its decade-long storyline, Bungie has discussed how it all might end - and addressed some recent criticism of how big story revelations have been handled. 


Speaking out just a couple of weeks after the origins of Destiny's space golf ball The Traveller were finally revealed - to a somewhat mixed response - Bungie staff have defended Destiny's storytelling techniques, and said players should not expect to make allies with the game's villainous Hive.


"The Hive has still committed a lot of, you know, genocide," senior narrative designer Robert Brookes told Dexerto, pouring cold water on the Guardians and the Hive suddenly becoming besties.

Yes, that's right. If you head over to the eShop right now, you can get your hands on The Last Hope - Dead Zone Survival, an "intense storyline game set in an apocalyptic world overrun by hordes of ravenous zombies". Launched on 30th June, it normally costs £8.99 but is currently on sale for just 99p. 


Having played The Last Hope myself, I would advise saving your pennies for something more worthwhile. Toothpicks, perhaps. You can see a trailer for The Last Hope below (and if you were still interested in playing the game afterwards, please note there are spoilers for The Last Hope below).

The update, which became available yesterday, fixes issues relating to certain quests and various other bugs but unfortunately also prevents players from being able to make money quickly.

The methods previously reported on Eurogamer, one using thrown weapons and another using frozen meat, now do not work in version 1.2.0 of the game. I've tested this myself, and am grateful I already cashed in 40k before I updated my version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Diablo 4 player has found what appeared to be - initially at least - a giant version of the game's terrifying Butcher enemy.


The Butcher, an infamous enemy from the first game, can randomly spawn in any dungeon, at any level, and is a particularly nasty foe to defeat.


Reddit user IronHeart_777 discovered a giant "beast of a Butcher" while running nightmare dungeons with friends, but don't worry - it's not actually a new version of the enemy.
