        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playdate, the mini monochrome handheld with a crank, will become available for pre-order in July priced $179 (UK price TBA). 
The exact date will be announced closer to the time, with a week's warning so you can be ready. The first units are "expected" to ship later in 2021.
Those details are different to those first announced back in May 2019, when the price was mentioned as $149. But Playdate's offering has now been improved, with a 4GB memory instead of 2GB, and an initial 24 game season: double the games originally planned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have already seen some mutterings about this on social media, but E3's online portal opened up to press this week - and to nobody's surprise, it's a real mess. This year's E3 is all-online thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and the portal is supposed to be some sort of substitute for the physical show, featuring virtual booths for exhibitors, online events, and a variety of articles and bits of content about games.
The portal goes a little further than you might expect, however, with old-school internet forums, an avatar system and a gamified rewards system. The latter is what really caught my attention, as not only can you earn points from nosing around the portal, but you can also compete in online leaderboards  to see who is The Biggest E3 Fan. Naturally, this appealed to my competitive side and I set out to land myself a spot at the top of the virtual podium. "With a limited pool of games media, this will be a cinch," I thought. But alas, my attempts to do so were foiled by an unexpected enemy: the E3 portal itself. 
Things started off pretty well. After doing some strange password reset shenanigans to actually get into my account, the E3 website presented me with an avatar creator (if you've ever heard of a picrew, it's basically that). I don't know why the avatar creator exists, but I think it might also be the best part of the E3 website. It's surprisingly lenient with what it will allow you to do - there are colour wheels for your hair and eyes, and you can even move your facial features around. Don't expect the sort of silliness you can get from something like Nintendo's Mii Maker, but the E3 avatar creator isn't afraid to get a little weird:

Expect updates on what's next for Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Rise, as well as a look ahead to July's Monster Hunter Stories 2 and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.
So, what do we expect for Resident Evil Village? Well, Capcom is yet to talk about post-launch single-player support for the game, if there is any. More likely, perhaps, we may get a glimpse of new bits and pieces coming to its PVE Mercenaries mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is your Russian feeling a little rusty? Not to worry, as an English translation for Fallout 2 mod Olympus 2207 has finally been released - so you can put the Russian dictionary down for now. 
Olympus 2207 is a huge total conversion mod for Fallout 2 that was released back in December 2014, and at long last, it now has an official English translation. The developers used Fallout 2's engine and basic mechanics to create a new story that's unconnected to the Fallout series: it adapts features like Fallout 2's skills and perks system, but adds new graphics, additional gameplay mechanics, and - of course - a bunch of new stories and quests. There's even a crafting system, a mini-game for hacking electronic panels, and a flexible structure with no main quest. "Do you want to become the tyrant of Radius, or do you want to improve the lives of everyone in it?," the official mod page explains. "The choice is yours!"
As explained in the lore section of the mod's website, the game takes place in the year 2207 in the Silicon Valley region of the US. The Great War of 2013 created an irradiated wasteland, and while some managed to escape into improvised shelters (or a luxurious vault called Livos), many had to "adapt to the new conditions on the evolutionary, genetic level". Sounds rough. Anyway, some lucky survivors found themselves inside a skyscraper called Olympus when this all went down. The game centres on this skyscraper, which everyone in the wasteland seems desperate to enter: it promises energy with its solar panels and protection from the horrors outside. If you can get past the guards at the bottom, however.

There's also a revamped battle pass system which has done away with the traditional levels 1-100 grind. Instead, levelling will give you "Stars" to spend on specific rewards you want, laid out over pages. Some items will require you to have finished off the rest of the page first, tempting you to level up further, but this should make nabbing individual items easier.
In the story trailer, we see the Fortnite island's inhabitants react to the arrival of an Independence Day-sized UFO, which hovers over the island and then appears to suck up its Zero Point energy source, destroying last season's Spire and primal ruins in the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has been delayed twice since its initial unveiling last September, now won't arrival until some time next year.
Originally, the Sands of Time remake - which is being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai - was due to launch this January, but the publisher postponed its release to March at the end of last year. When February arrived, however, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the game once more, this time indefinitely, while it worked on delivering "a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original".
All's been quite on the news front since then, but in a new statement posted to Twitter - ostensibly confirming that the remake will be absent from this year's Ubisoft Forward livestream - the publisher has shared a revised release window of 2022 for the remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a new update for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition - and you'll want to have it downloaded smartish if you're looking to save your eardrums. 
Yes, those deafening mass relay jumps are now quieter - something many fans had called on BioWare to fix for years.
Mass Effect's intergalactic jump points have always been noisy, though the otherwise excellent Legendary Edition has surprised some newer players (or those yet to experience hearing loss) when they find out how loud mass relays are.

The freeze on withdrawals was a consequence of King being investigated by PayPal over how Royal Games operates in specific countries. 
After a lengthy investigation by Eurogamer, the site's withdrawal page has now become available again, though the site continues to no longer accept real-world money deposits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the start of the weekend we heard that CD Projekt's stolen data was being shared online, and it seems the floodgates are now well and truly open. A bunch of dev-made bug compilation videos are now circulating on social media and file-sharing sites, showing some rarely-seen work-in-progress builds and rather spectacular bugs.  
As Eurogamer reported on Friday, some dev videos had already started to leak alongside the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 and Thronebreaker, and it appears many of these are now being shared on 4chan, Reddit and YouTube. Most of the videos are being shared using video hosting platform Streamable, but many are now being pulled offline (they are, after all, the result of an illegal ransomware hack). 
Some are short clips showing the player-character being ricocheted into the sky to the sound of Shooting Stars, or being knocked out only to wake up to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim opening. Others are more complex - one compilation shows several bugs with an off-tune recorder version of Spoiler (the track by DJ Hyper used in Cyberpunk's 2018 E3 trailer). Another lengthy edit called "CyberElBuggado2020" shows hotdog motorbikes, NPCs T-posing to the sound of Thriller, and Johnny Silverhand saying "this is going to be a disaster" in Spanish.

In a tweet, Naka said he left Square Enix at the end of April. Balan Wonderworld, which Naka directed and Square Enix published on multiple platforms in March, flopped at retail. It sold less than 2100 copies in its opening week in Japan, and failed to make the top 40 in the UK physical chart.
On his departure from Square Enix, Naka said: "I can't talk about the reason now, but I hope I can talk about it when the time comes. As for future activities, I'm 55 years old, so I may retire."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An artist has alleged Capcom stole her photos in the creation of Resident Evil and Devil May Cry games.
As reported by Polygon, designer Judy A. Juracek filed a lawsuit in a Connecticut court on Friday that alleges Capcom used unlicensed copyrighted photos for the creation of some of its games - and even for the Resident Evil 4 logo.
At the heart of this lawsuit is Juracek's book, Surfaces, a visual research for artists, architects and designers that includes 1200 photographs of textures she took herself. Surfaces, which was originally published in 1996, includes a CD-ROM of the images, which require a licence for commercial use.

It's part of Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest.
There's no word on what to expect from the show, although I suspect it will follow the same unhinged theme of previous Devolver Digital E3 shows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvelous and Grasshopper Manufacture's cult-hack-and-slash adventures No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle are heading to Steam next Wednesday, 9th June.
First released on Wii in 2007, No More Heroes follows the stylish, frequently ludicrous, and dependably ultra-violent adventures of Travis Touchdown, an ordinary game and anime geek who inadvertently becomes embroiled with the United Assassins Association.
What follows is a third-person hack-and-slash romp, replete with a phenomenal soundtrack, that sees Travis - lightsaber-like beam Katana in hand - murdering his way through the Association's top-ranked assassins in order to stay alive. If you've never played the game before, expect geysers of blood, a winningly weird sense of humour, and (rather barren) bike-based open-world interludes in amongst the spirited and largely entertaining action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its surprise appearance during a fiscal year financial presentation last week, publisher 505 Games has confirmed that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the acclaimed 2019 Castlevania spiritual successor from Koji Igarashi and developer ArtPlay, is getting a sequel.
Word of a sequel originally surfaced after keen-eyed internet sorts spotted a bullet point inserted into 505 Games' latest fiscal year financial results, stating a "second version" of  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was in development.
Although the term "second version" left a certain ambiguity as to whether this was referring to a sequel or something else, 505 has now offered clarity in a development update on Reddit. "Regarding recent reports," it wrote, "[505 Games and Artplay] are in very early planning stages for a Bloodstained sequel".

2021 marks the second year running that Summer Games Done Quick is going online-only - traditionally, shows have been ticketed real-world events, with all speedrunning showcases being streamed online - and the precautions established last year will remain in place to "ensure the continued safety of our attendees, runners, volunteers, and staff", according to organisers.
Even without the live-event element, there's still plenty to look forward to, with this year's show offering a full seven days of speedrunning, from Sunday, 4th July, to 11th July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, CD Projekt confirmed it had been hit by a "targeted cyber attack" that saw its internal systems compromised and sensitive information held to ransom. After CD Projekt said it would not comply with the group's demands, the hackers announced that source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent and an unreleased version of The Witcher 3 would be auctioned to the highest bidder, and source code for Gwent was publicly leaked. 
At the time, the hackers claimed they had received a satisfying offer for the information, and the auction was then closed with a condition of "no further distribution" agreed with the buyer. But that stolen data now appears to have resurfaced, with source code, assets and software development kits for platforms including the PlayStation 5 seemingly being shared online. Eurogamer has also seen internal development videos showing work-in-progress builds of Cyberpunk 2077. 
According to security blog DataBreaches.net, earlier this week a threat actor group decided to release CD Projekt's information in order to promote its new leaks platform. A note from the hackers was also discovered by security software provider Emsisoft back in March (via IT Pro), and an uncensored version of this was shared on 4chan yesterday (the link provided in the note no longer works, but the data is now being shared elsewhere). The note claims the release of the stolen information is part of a "charity fundraising" effort - although as the group is asking for payment in cryptocurrency, there's no way to guarantee that's actually going to a good cause.

The mobile version of NetherRealm's fighting game was accused of being "tone deaf" after an in-game challenge designed to celebrate Pride Month tasked players with defeating canonically bisexual character Poison Ivy hundreds of thousands of times.
Rewards for completing the community challenge included Harley Quinn tokens - a nod to Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn's romantic relationship in DC Comics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has once again turned its attention to virtual reality of the PlayStation kind, with another of its PSVR showcases - and if you missed its various announcements, you can catch up below.
First up, Sniper Elite VR - unsurprisingly a virtual reality spin on developer Rebellion's long-range FPS series - will be launching on 8th July. The studio is promising a "powerful World War 2 story" told through the eyes of an Italian Partisan, said to deliver a "new perspective" on the franchise's acclaimed stealth and sniping action.
Next up is a reveal for new game Wanderer, created by M Theory and Oddboy. This one's an immersive time travel adventure - melding narrative-driven exploration, puzzling, and mini-games - in which you're able to embody some of history's most famous explorers, inventors, and conquerors as you hop back and forth between ancient civilisations, war time, the hippie-hued 60s, even the far flung, post-apocalyptic future. Wanderer is due to arrive this summer.

        <link href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-03-rusts-new-contact-system-will-help-you-tell-friend-from-foe"/>
        <updated>2021-06-03T19:04:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust is infamous for having a pretty hostile player base - something I learned the hard way when I first started playing - but a change arriving this month could make it easier to avoid your worst neighbours. A new "contact system" is being rolled out as part of Rust's June update, and it will highlight those who have done bad things to you. 
"Upon meeting a new player they'll be logged into your contacts and the contact system will now keep a history of all interactions (good, bad, indifferent, rage-inducing etc)," Facepunch explained in a press release. "To help quickly identify friend from foe, players' nameplates will now display blue for friendly and red for hostile. Waving at players will reveal your name (it doesn't always pay to be nice...) and using binoculars will reveal if a player is unknown, hostile or friendly from large distances."
On the surface, it sounds similar to the way hostile players are marked in Red Dead Online with a red dot or star depending on their recent actions. With Rust, however, it seems like it will be up to the individual to categorise other players: you can designate someone as an enemy, for instance, and make notes on each player you meet. Seems like a handy way to keep track of all those nakeds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontier has released a second major update for space sim Elite Dangerous' poorly received Odyssey expansion, bringing a raft of much-needed improvements, ranging from UI enhancements and graphics optimisations to AI tweaks and many, many bug fixes.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched last month, quickly accruing a 'Mostly Negative' rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.
As the negative reviews continued, Frontier Developments boss David Braben stepped in, releasing a statement apologising "to those who have been suffering from these problems" and insisting that addressing Odyssey's myriad reported issues was the studio's "priority and focus."

Frostpunk, which launched to much acclaim in 2018, is a fascinating, if decidedly gruelling, experience. It's a sort of narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder, challenging players to stay alive and, as much as is possible in Frostpunk's desolate sub-zero world, thrive.
That's done by establishing a settlement with a vast generator at its centre, a precariously fuel-hungry device intended to provide some degree of warmth for your population as, at your command, they set about scavenging the land for supplies needed to expand their new home.

It's an MMO I've been following since it Kickstarted in 2015 (after which it raised more money via player investment and in-game property sales), and one I've played a bit of recently. It's a slightly tricky one to explain.
In general, it's an online fantasy game about fighting other players. That is the point. There's a bit of monster fighting, but only really to serve as a tutorial while you quickly level up. There's a level-cap of 30 which you can get quite close to in a few hours if you're speedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few months, Apex Legends players have increasingly reported problems with DDoS attacks in their games: one moment they've been sliding their way around World's Edge, the next, their game has frozen and they've been booted out. It's become a particular issue in Ranked games, where miscreants have used DDoS attacks to artificially boost themselves up the leaderboards. Hoovering up a bunch of disconnected opponents is easier than actually playing the game, after all. 
Respawn has already indicated it's taking the situation seriously - banning some behind high-profile cases, and mentioning that it's even considering legal action against those carrying out the attacks. But it seems progress is being made towards a more permanent solution, with security analyst Conor "Hideouts" Ford explaining on Twitter that significant progress has been made on a fix. 
"The DDoS situation is being addressed as we speak by our very own @ricklesauceur [lead software engineer Samy Duc]," Ford said. "It isn't the easiest fix in the world but huge steps are being made to take care of this."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bend Studio, perhaps best known as the developer behind 2019's post-apocalyptic bikes-and-zombies adventure Days Gone, has revealed it's working on a new IP.
Days Gone - which initially launched on PS4 before making it way to PC earlier this year - was the studio's first crack at a new IP since its acquisition by Sony in 2000; prior to that game, the developer was largely known for adapting the likes of Uncharted and Resistance for Sony's handheld consoles, the PSP and Vita.
Announcing its next project in a statement on Twitter,  Bend wrote, "We are beyond grateful for your support with Days Gone and are truly honoured by the amount of passion our community has shared with us for our world and characters. Your enthusiasm motivates us to continue to improve and create experiences that will last a lifetime."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Games' ceaselessly evolving exploratory space sim No Man's Sky has just received another free update on all platforms; it's called Prisms, and brings sweeping visual enhancements to the already striking sci-fi sandbox.
Prisms, No Man's Sky's 17th named update since its release back in 2016, touches up the game's visual presentation pretty much across the board. Planets, for instance, get enhanced weather effects - Hello Games highlights rain, which now refracts the light and causes surfaces to become slick and wet - while underground caves become more detailed, with improved lighting and volumetric fog.
Planetary fauna, meanwhile, has been overhauled with proper fur effects and, as a bonus, flying creatures - which were sadly neglected in No Man's Sky's taming-based Companions update - can now be adopted and ridden through the sky.

Chief among them is the ability to shut the annoying narrator up. Biomutant's incorporeal narrator is certainly pretty chatty, commenting on pretty much everything you do and translating everything anyone says. Prior to the release of this patch, while you were able to tone the narrator down, you couldn't shut him up completely. Now you can.
Here are the relevant patch notes:

As officially released, Super Mario Bros. was 104 minutes. This new version - dubbed the Morton Jankel Cut in honour of its husband and wife director team - runs 125 minutes, with most scenes extended.

Announced last summer, New Genesis is described as the "next-generation" of Phantasy Star Online 2, and catapults the action forward 1,000 years after the Oracle's battle in PSO2.
Bundled alongside the base game, it includes a new graphics engine, enhanced character models, a new multi-weapon system, and, most notably, a "wide-open battlefield" with changing time and weather, traversable using new abilities like the Photon Dash and Photon Glide. There's also cross-platform play, plus fully localised text and character voices in English.

Tell Me Why, if you're unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the picturesque Alaskan town of Delos Crossing - a task that ultimately forces them to confront their traumatic past.
What follows is a deft blend of supernatural mystery thriller and earnest, character-driven homecoming drama - there's real beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists - that's arguably Dontnod's most assured, consistently enjoyable outing yet, even if its perhaps not quite as devastatingly memorable as its Life is Strange forebears.

This week the British developer announced it had wrapped up work on Total War: Three Kingdoms with the 1.7.1 patch. No more DLC or patches will be released for the game, which broke series records upon launch in May 2019.
Total War: Three Kingdoms saw seven DLC releases over the course of two years, but many fans feel Creative Assembly quit the game too early - and before the release of a promised expansion that would build out the north of the map.

In the patch notes for Sim Update 4, aka patch 1.16.20.0, the development team said it had performed optimisations for the initial full download of Microsoft Flight Simulator so the base game is 83GB instead of over 170GB.
It's good news to see the game's download halved, although 83GB is still a chunky old effort.

That's according to a single, and only mildly informative, slide found within publisher 505 Games' latest fiscal year financial results presentation (as spotted by Gematsu) - which, as well as noting that Bloodstained has now sold more than 1m copies, amassing over €30m in sales, confirms a "second version" is currently in development.
As Gematsu points out, "second version", although a somewhat unusual turn of phrase in this context, appears throughout the presentation in conjunction with other properties that have confirmed sequels, such as One More Level's action-parkour game Ghostrunner.

But, tellingly, GAME's terms and conditions for this offer make it clear that this is only open to the public - and not to "trade" resellers looking for a quick profit.
"GAME reserves the right to refuse any offer to anyone believed to be representing a trade buyer/customer," the chain states. In other words, if you manage a CEX, no telling your staff to go upgrade dozens of knackered Xbox Ones for Series S to just resell the newer consoles for profit. This may well apply if you're an organised scalper, too.

The social deduction game, which originally released in 2018 but became enormously popular during the lockdowns of 2020, is free as part of Epic's ongoing Mega Sale (which lasts until 17th June). Those who have an Epic Games Store account can grab Among Us for free until 3rd June.
Once you've claimed the free game, you'll have access to new map The Airship, and be able to play with friends on other platforms like Switch, Android and iOS. The game is due to arrive on PlayStation later this year, too, so hopefully there won't be any problems with cross-play there.

2013's Company of Heroes 2 is widely regarded as one of the best RTS games around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 has a new game director - and it's former creative director Gabriel Amatangelo. 
Amatangelo joined CD Projekt back in January 2020, and will now take over from former game director Adam Badowski. According to a report by GamesIndustry.biz, Badowski will now focus on other leadership duties within CD Projekt, including the company's new "strategic development framework" that will see the Cyberpunk and Witcher brands developed in parallel. 
Before becoming a creative director for Cyberpunk 2077, Amatangelo also worked as a design director on Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC, and lead designer on several expansions for Star Wars: The Old Republic. Cyberpunk 2077's roadmap indicates that we should see several free DLCs for the game over the next year, and Amatangelo certainly has some experience in this area.

Sonic fans soon poked around the trailer's innards on the hunt for clues. Thankfully, Sega itself stepped in with a press release that names the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as it promised, Sony has pulled back the veil on Guerrilla Games' highly anticipated Horizon Forbidden West, sharing 14 minutes of gorgeous gameplay running on PlayStation 5.
As you can see in the video below, it's an immediate feast for the eyes, beginning as Aloy scrambles through dense jungle foliage before stumbling out onto a oceanside settlement, all sandy beaches, deep blue water, and vast rock spires on the horizon, shrouded in clouds. These, Guerrilla later confirms, are the remnants of San Francisco, millennia into the future, and it's here that Aloy encounters machine-riding raiders, immediately embarking on some nimble combat, firing arrows and hurtling acrobatically around the environment to escape their attack.
This initial sequence ends beneath the waves as Aloy swims through gorgeous coral reefs, kelp, and exotic fauna, fighting the current as she goes. Eventually she reaches dry land and encounters the raiders once more, this time choosing to take a more stealthy approach as she attempts to liberate her kidnapped friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Techland's parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel, Dying Light 2, has - after a rather tumultuous few years of development - finally received a release date. It'll be coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 7th December, and Techland has released a brand-new gameplay trailer to accompany the news.
Dying Light 2 is set 20 years after the events of the first game, in a world devastated by a mutated version of the original virus. With over 98% of the population now lost, the remnants of humanity have congregated in the sprawling metropolis of Villedor, also known as The City, and it's here that new protagonist Aiden Caldwell finds himself while searching for his family.
To date, Techland has really only painted the ensuing adventure in broad strokes, talking up key points such as Dying Light 2's 2-4 player co-op, its returning day and night cycle, and its focus on choice and consequence. Today's developer livestream didn't go too much further than those core concepts, but did flesh them out with a few additional details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic's 30th anniversary livestream has come and gone, leaving a big blue streak in its wake, and while it wasn't perhaps the most revelatory of showings, Sega did at least confirm the previously rumoured Sonic Colors remaster and retro Sonic collection - as well as providing the tiniest teases of Sonic's next major game.
Starting with the remaster, it's called Sonic Colors Ultimate and will be heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (exclusively via the Epic Games Store) on 7th September this year.
As those who've played the 2010 original will know, Sonic Colors transports the iconic mascot to Dr. Robotnik's interstellar theme park for a familiar blend of appropriately high-speed into-the-screen and side-on platforming, with the hedgehog able to access handy new skills, such as a speed boost or the ability to drill underground, thanks to friendly Wisps.

Our first look at polished Aragami 2 gameplay lies in the new trailer below, which shows a new threat for the Rashomon Valley and various ninja-inspired fights.
The original Aragami sold 700k copies and helped grow Lince Works as a studio, the developer said in a release today, meaning Aragami 2 is now the work of a more experienced and larger team. Combat has been overhauled, and looks sneakier than ever. Here's a peek:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has said PlayStation cross-platform support has been cut from an upcoming Borderlands 3 patch - though without explaining why. 
In a tweet sent this afternoon, Pitchford said that while a Borderlands 3 update had been prepared for release "that includes full crossplay support across all platforms", PlayStation will ultimately not be included.
Pitchford did not detail why, upon submitting the patch for certification, Gearbox was then forced to remove crossplay by the game's publisher 2K. Did Sony suddenly decide to take issue with the game's long-promised crossplay becoming a reality? Or did Gearbox and/or 2K decide not to play by Sony's rules? Pitchford has so far chosen not to elaborate.

The 1.7.1 patch, which goes live today, marks the end of the British studio's post-launch support for the popular strategy game, which saw seven DLC releases over the course of two years.
The development team has transitioned onto another project based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel, Creative Assembly said in a video to fans, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot more to Sony's PlayStation investor relations document than confirmation Uncharted 4 is coming to PC.
The document, published as part of Sony's 2021 investor relations day, focuses on the company's Game & Network Services Segment. It's penned by PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, and includes a number of interesting bits of information that reveal Sony's masterplan for its money-printing video games business.
At the beginning, Sony mentions it's "building our biggest-ever platform" with PlayStation 5, and that it's working to ensure "our longest-ever tail" with the PS4. PS5 has delivered PlayStation's highest-ever launch sales, with 7.8m units sold as of the end of Sony's last financial year (ending March 2021).

This year, tickets for the two-day affair cost just £5 (or $5), a third of 2020's fee. Once again, there will be no physical event, and all players will be able to take part wherever they are. 
There will also be plenty to do for people who don't purchase a ticket.

That's the eye-watering amount EA made during its 2021 financial year from Ultimate Team modes across its sports games.
But - and this won't come as a surprise to anyone - FIFA Ultimate Team made the bulk of that money. Or, as EA recently put it in a regulatory financial document, "a substantial portion".

In a document published as part of Sony's Investor Relations day, Sony mentions Uncharted 4 under "more PC releases planned" (it's on page 26).
Sony is putting more of its PlayStation 4 games on PC. It's already released Guerrilla's Horizon: Zero Dawn on PC and, most recently, Sony Bend's Days Gone. It makes sense that Naughty Dog's five-year-old adventure game would be part of Sony's PC push.

I understand this is to ensure third-parties working on games which support the upgraded Switch are free to announce these projects at E3, and before Nintendo's own digital showcase later in that week. 
(Nintendo's event has yet to be formally dated but is currently set to slot in after other publishers towards the end of E3, though of course dates can still shift.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Quest celebrated its 35th anniversary in some style in the early hours of this morning, with a livestream from Japan heralding the announcement of a string of new entries and spin-offs for the much-loved RPG series.
Heading the lot was Dragon Quest 12, which will be the first mainline entry since 2017. Not much was shown beyond a brief trailer revealing a logo - though that logo did reveal a turn towards dark fantasy, and what series' creator dubbed a Dragon Quest 'for adults'. It's being primed for a simultaneous worldwide release - in what would be a first for a mainline entry - though the timing has yet to be revealed, while no platforms have been announced just yet. 
Elsewhere, a remake of Dragon Quest 3 was announced, taking on the 2D/3D stylings of the likes of Octopath Traveler - and being ushered into existence by Octopath Traveler producer Masaaki Hayasaka. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D, as it's somewhat clumsily called at present, again has no release date or confirmed platforms, though it is also slated for a worldwide simultaneous release and we were afforded a look at it in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a little over two weeks away from this year's attempt at an online-only E3, meaning everyone'll soon be sinking into the familiar swamp of showcase schedules and diary dates required to keep track of the event and everything around it. Wisely starting early to avoid the ensuing scramble, though, Microsoft has announced a 13th June air date for this year's E3-adjacent Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase.
It'll be a significant event for a number of reasons, not least because it's the first joint announcement show for the two companies following Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda last year, and things kick off at 10am PT on Sunday, 13th June - which, for us UK folk, equates to an entirely tolerable 6pm in the afternoon. It's a long one too, with Microsoft promising 90-minutes of announcements - hopefully that's a taut 90 minutes with none of the waffly filler it usually loves to pad out its livestreams with (hello Inside Xbox, I'm looking at you).
As you'd expect, there's little in the way of specific regarding the games we'll be seeing - all the better to retain that all-important element of surprise - and Microsoft is merely teasing a look at the "epic gaming lineup coming out of [the Bethesda] partnership, the incredible games coming to Xbox this holiday, upcoming releases on Xbox Game Pass, and more."

Last year's real-world BlizzCon was cancelled due to coronavirus-related "health and safety considerations", and its long-awaited digital-only replacement - formally titled BlizzConline - eventually took place in February this year. Since then, it's been unclear if Blizzard was still planning to press ahead with a proper large-scale physical gathering in 2021, perhaps around the early November weekend usually reserved for its BlizzCon shows.
In a new post on the BlizzCon website, however, show executive producer Saralyn Smith has now confirmed the 2021 event will not be going ahead.

Smith - whose other notable video game roles have included Ezio Auditore da Firenze in the Assassin's Creed series, Chris Redfield in the Resident Evil series, Batman in Batman: Arkham Oranges, and Mirage in Apex Legends - had voiced Sonic since 2010, even lending his vocal talents to the character in the Wreck-it-Ralph films.
However, back in January, Smith tweeted, "Welp, 10 years was an amazing run. Onward to new zones!", alongside an image of a broken blue heart. Sega later confirmed what fans had already suspected, announcing Smith's departure from the Sonic role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With little fanfare and less than a month until its release, Sega has confirmed Olympic Games Tokyo 2020: The Official Video Game will arrive on 22nd June 2021. 
An officially-licensed compilation of 18 Olympic sport mini-games, it will launch for PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Stadia and Xbox.
Of course, it's unsurprising Sega has left this news until so late. While the real-world Olympics are (currently) set to go ahead in July, a year later than originally planned, the debate continues on whether it is right to hold the games at all while many countries - not least its host, Japan - continue to struggle with the impacts of coronavirus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's normally a bit of tuning work to be done when a new legend is introduced to Apex Legends, and jetpack-wielding hero Valkyrie is no exception. Some of her flights are lasting a little longer than Respawn would like, it seems, and the developer has decided to clip her wings. 
As explained by associate live balance designer John Larson, players figured out that hovering with Valkyrie's jetpack currently costs very little fuel - and were using this to "take coffee breaks above the final fight in scrims". It reminds me a bit of when Fortnite players used planes to stay out of battles until the very last moment. 
In any case, the 10 percent fuel cost for hovering is now being removed entirely, and from Thursday onwards it will cost you the full 100 percent to hang around in the air. When asked why it was being removed rather than nerfed, Larson said that Respawn experimented with a 50-75 percent fuel cost, but found that this "didn't feel meaningfully different and still allowed Valk to stay airborne for too long in certain final rings.

And now there seems to be a western-themed PUBG game codenamed Project Cowboy on the way. 
South Korean media outlet Bloter spotted job adverts on Krafton's website for an "open-world shooting game" that will release on console and PC as an independent title (via Google Translate). Krafton apparently told Bloter that "Project Cowboy is a new IP game for Battleground developed by Krafton". PUBG dataminer PlayerIGN described it as "PUBG's western custom mode" with "old west guns only".   
Eurogamer contacted Krafton for comment, and was told the company has "nothing to share on Project Cowboy as of now".

Crimson Glow Valstrax, if the name sounds familiar, is a new variant of the Elder Dragon first introduced in Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, making its Rise debut with a new form and attacks. The beast is able to change the shape of it wings, notes Capcom, enabling it to fly freely through the sky and survive at unusually high altitudes.
As for the Apex Zinogre, it's a tougher version of the familiar Monster Hunter staple already in Rise, and features a striking new look with its golden fur and lightning. Capcom says it'll make an appearance in Rampage quests but can be tackled as part of a standard quest too.

The new games for Switch were announced back in February, and are essentially retro-style remakes of the original Diamond and Pearl games. In the overworld characters take on a chibi art style, but there are also full-size Pokémon battles. 
Another Sinnoh game arrives early next year, called Pokémon Legends Arceus, which sees players explore a more feudal version of the region with old school pokéballs - and you'll be tasked with creating the first ever Pokédex.

The first of these changes is the upcoming Miramar remaster, which is being rolled out in patch 12.1 (now live on PC test servers). Miramar has been tweaked and revamped before, but this time it's getting a "much larger remastering", using the technology used to improve other maps like Sanhok to tweak the "lighting, performance, graphical fidelity, topography, and of course special features". 
Players can also expect to find "overhauls to terrain and building textures and layouts, easier traversal with the removal of unnecessary obstacles, and even updated cliffs to better fit in the more vertical experience the game has become". PUBG Corp provided a helpful before and after so you can see exactly what the improvements will look like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve is reportedly readying to enter the hardware market once more, this time with a new "Switch-like" handheld gaming PC that could potentially launch by the end of the year.
That's according to a report by Ars Technica, which expands on the recent discovery of a new hardware-related code - referring to a mysterious device known as "SteamPal" - in the latest version of Steam. Citing "multiple sources familiar with the matter", Ars Technica claims this device (whose final name remains unconfirmed) is a new Valve-developed all-in-one portable gaming PC that features gamepad controls and a touchscreen in a similar form factor to Nintendo's Switch, albeit without detachable controllers.
SteamPal, or whatever it ends up being called (obviously, not calling it the Gabe Boy would be a serious missed opportunity), is reportedly designed to run a large number of games on the Steam PC platform via Linux, and can "dock" to a monitor via its USB Type-C port.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Magnificent Trufflepigs, a romantic first-person metal-detecting adventure from Andrew Crawshaw, lead designer on The Chinese Room's Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, now has a release date and will be making its way to PC next Wednesday, 2nd June.
Trufflepigs is the work of Crawshaw's Leeds-based studio Thunkd (which says it wants to become synonymous with "high-quality, short-form, 'evening-sized' games"), and tells the story of Adam - voiced by Doctor Who and Legends of Tomorrow's Arthur Darvill - as he returns to his childhood home in the heart of the English countryside.
What follows is a game of laid-back metal detecting and exploration with a "strong interpersonal narrative" as Adam reunites with old friend Beth (played by Safe House and Another Eden's Luci Fish) and joins her on a quest to find a local treasure connected to her past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axiom Verge 2, the sequel to developer Thomas Happ's acclaimed retro-styled Metroid-a-like, is delayed again, and is now expected to launch in the latter half of this year.
Happ had initially planned to launch Axiom Verge 2 on PC and Switch at some point in 2020, but ultimately opted to postpone release into the first half of this year for a variety of reasons. That window was later narrowed to "spring", but the developer has now announced an additional delay, pushing the game's release back to "Q3" 2021 - indicating it'll likely arrive between the start of July and the end of September.
"I could go into a long spiel about why it's taking longer than I originally forecast," Happ wrote in a post on his blog, "but I don't want to get too bogged down into technical details. Suffice it to say that the game will be better for the additional time, and I won't have to burn myself out crunching to hit a date that I set for myself."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wondering what Sonic's been up to lately? Well, it looks like Sega's poised to reveal all in a 30th anniversary livestream for the prickly blue icon, scheduled to take place this Thursday.
Sonic Central, as Sega's calling its digital showcase, gets underway at 5pm BST/9am PT this Thursday, 27th May, and promises a first look at a number of upcoming "projects, partnerships, and events" the company has been working on as part of its anniversary celebrations.
There's no hint as to what those might be as yet, but recent rumours have suggested Sega is prepping both a new collection of classic Sonic titles and a remaster of the hedgehog's 2010 outing Sonic Colors. Perhaps we'll also finally get a glimpse of Sonic's next major new game, which was confirmed to be in production back in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a busy day for developer Ion Lands; not only is its gorgeous Blade Runner-esque delivery thriller Cloudpunk's "sequel-sized" paid DLC, City of Ghosts, now available on PC, the studio has announced a new cyberpunk-themed life-sim spin-off too.
City of Angels, which seems as good a place as any to start, offers a brand-new, fully voiced story campaign that serves as a direct sequel to the original game. Main protagonist Rania and canine companion Camus return for another skyhigh HOVA-based jaunt around the neon-drenched metropolis of Nivalis, but this time there's a new hero - deadbeat gambler Hayse - with players switching between two interlinking stories as the adventure unfolds.
Ion Worlds says City of Angels is longer than the original story, as well as "darker, tenser, more complex", and promises new areas to explore, new characters and mysteries, HOVA customisation, street racing, and different endings depending on player choices. It's out now on Steam for £12.99/$14.99 USD, and there's a 10% launch day discount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember bird dating sim Hatoful Boyfriend? It's hard to forget, to be honest, but if you haven't yet bought it on iOS, Android or the PlayStation Store then your time is limited, as the game is being delisted from these platforms at the end of May. 
Manga artist and Hatoful Boyfriend creator Hato Moa announced the news on her Twitter account earlier this week, explaining that both Hatoful Boyfriend and its seasonal sequel Holiday Star will no longer be purchasable on these platforms as "publishing agreements on those platforms are coming to an end". Those who already bought the games through these platforms will still be able to use them, however, while the games will remain on sale via Steam. 
If you missed it the first time around, well, Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel about dating birds that was released back in 2014. I guess you can say it's been out for aviary long time. You play as the only human student accepted into a school for birds, where you must navigate classes and build relationships with talking birds. It's all pretty eccentric, but the game earned itself a cult following and critical acclaim for the quality of its character writing.

This morning, Fortnite received update 16.50, the last patch expected before its next season on 7th June. Eagle-eyed fans immediately noticed several changes around the island: a crashed helicopter near the dam, posters showing UFOs and friendly aliens at the beach, and flattened corn at the farm. 
3pm UK time today brought a new set of "Foreshadowing" challenges live, where you're asked to investigate that helicopter, as well as a series of smashed telescopes on the island. Does someone not want its inhabitants looking at the skies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A much-requested feature has finally been introduced to Apex Legends' Arenas mode, as the 3v3 team deathmatches now have a leaving penalty - something that should hopefully deter players from flaking on their squadmates. 
Several changes were announced via patch notes posted on Twitter, including the new abandon penalty for Arenas games. Respawn explained that this is similar to the penalty for Ranked Battle Royale games, and will apply to those who leave a full squad in the middle of a match. 
Unfortunately it seems a couple of people are currently getting unfairly punished by the new penalty, with some reporting being slapped with 10-minute sin bins for leaving during the end screen animations. Director of communications Ryan K. Rigney assured one player that the team was investigating the problem.

The gameplay, which you can see in the video below, is narrated by game director Jeff Lydell and design director Ian Christy from developer Gasket Games. We see a small group of Stormcast Eternals during a mid-to-late battle of the campaign against a modest Nighthaunt army.
The Stormcast Eternals' numbers are few, so Lydell makes smart use of his units' skills as well as knowledge of the environment (pushback, high ground bonuses, lethal hazards etc) to win the assasination mission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an agonisingly long hiatus Sega's much-loved fighting series Virtua Fighter is back, with a remaster of the most recent game coming to PlayStation 4 next month. 
Virtua Fighter: Ultimate Showdown looks to be a remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, the last installment which hit arcades way back in 2010. Final Showdown was itself the last iteration of Virtua Fighter 5, folding in new characters Taka-Arashi and Jean Kujo as well as introducing a more athletic moveset for its cast. We wrote some nice things about it in our Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown review upon its console launch in 2012. 
Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown saw the series bow out at its peak, although it's been kept alive in some way via appearances in the arcades of Sega's hugely successful Yakuza games. Is this the mark of a grand return for Virtua Fighter? The trailer - exclusively hosted on IGN - suggests perhaps not, declaring that the ultimate 3D fighter is back for the final round, with this remaster coinciding with Sega's ongoing 60th anniversary celebrations. Still, there remains hope and it's a delight to see the series back in any form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a trial that began with teens flooding the public phone line, gave us debates over the appropriateness of a naked banana, and asked the eternal question "what is Eurogamer?" Yes, the Epic Games v Apple antitrust trial has now concluded, and after three weeks of remarkable discussions the decision over who won rests with a federal judge.
The trial wrapped up yesterday with some closing remarks from both parties, with Epic reiterating that the case would have an impact on the wider mobile games market and other developers (via GamesIndustry.biz). 
"Epic acknowledges that this is an important case, that there's an important set of conduct, and that a remedy... of the sort that Epic has requested would be important and significant," said Epic's counsel Gary Bornstein. "But that is because the issue affects such a large number of consumers, such a large number of developers, and has persisted for such a long period of time."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two months ago, Pokémon Go added a tier system to its loot box-style eggs, which for the first time gave some visibility to the chances of their contents.
This made sorting which eggs to hatch much easier, as it was now clear which were from specific events, and it was also a welcome first step to indicating the likelihood of getting a specific creature, something fans have been loudly calling out for over the past few years.
Now, with weeks of data to test, a group of more than 50 hardcore players at top fan community The Silph Road has analysed thousands of egg hatches to see how well the tier system matches up to reality - and there are some surprising findings.

The project still sounds far-off, and there's no word on what has been holding up development - but the wheels now seem to be turning.
"We actually do have a script that's being written for the Portal movie now at [Warner Bros.]," Abrams said today (thanks, IGN) "We're really excited about the take and the pitch, so it feels like that thing's finally on the rails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mini Motorways, the acclaimed road-building strategy sim from developer Dinosaur Polo Club, is coming to PC and Mac via Steam on 20th July, with a Switch release to follow early next year.
If you weren't already aware, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club's equally excellent underground railway builder Mini Metro, and, despite its shift in focus, takes a similarly minimalist approach to its tactile strategy action.
This time around, your goal is to construct an efficient road network - traffic lights, bridges, motorways, and all - to ensure commuters can travel from their home to their (same-coloured) destination before the timer runs out. New building items are awarded each in-game week so your ceaseless march of urban expansion may continue, and just like in Mini Metro, things can quickly become as fraught as they are soothingly low-key.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Truck Simulator now has official - albeit experimental - multiplayer support, courtesy of developer SCS Software's latest open beta build, meaning digital truckers need truck the lonely trucking life no more.
Official multiplayer support, which SCS is calling Convoy for self-explanatory reasons, is available now as part of American Truck Simulator's experimental beta update 1.41, and will be making its way to Euro Truck Simulator 2 at a later date.
Once installed, this initial work-in-progress version of Convoy will enable players to set-up and host their own private multiplayer session for up to eight trucking pals. Everyone in a session will see synchronised time, weather, and AI traffic - as well as their trucking buddies' paint jobs and truck accessories - and can undertake the same contracts from the same companies, all heading to the same destination. In-game communication options, if you need them, include CB radio broadcast, quick replies, and text chat.

Samorost, which originally released in 2003, serves up an engaging, if brisk, blend of point-and-click puzzling and toy-like tinkering as players follow the delightfully surreal interplanetary adventures of an adorable space gnome.
Samorost has been free to play via web browser for quite some time, but it's now available as a free downloadable game on iOS and Android, as well as on PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io - meaning all three currently released Samorost titles (the latter two being more substantial paid offerings) are now accessible on the aforementioned storefronts for your amusement.

The post, published to Ubisoft's blog, comes in the wake of a French report in Le Télégramme this month that claimed the company had made only minimal changes. Ubisoft rebutted some of that report at the time, while today's statement from the very top of the company doubles down further.
"Last June, we faced the fact that not all team members were experiencing the safe and inclusive workplace that we had always intended Ubisoft to be," Guillemot writes. "Since then, we have engaged in a company-wide effort to listen, learn and build a roadmap for a better Ubisoft for all.

Word on the project initially began circulating over the weekend on Reddit and Resetera, and well-connected journalist and former Kinda Funny co-host Imran Khan has now lent further credence to the rumours, citing sources able to corroborate the news in a story on Fanbyte.
Final Fantasy Origins is said to take place "somewhere in or adjacent to the world of the first Final Fantasy game on the NES" and will slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja's own Nioh games and From Software's Souls series - albeit with a more accessible focus to appeal to a wider audience, according to Khan's sources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Street Fighter 2's most enduring myths has finally been proven true 30 years after it began.
The myth is that Street Fighter 2: World Warrior, which launched in 1991, contains a 10-0 matchup between Zangief and E. Honda.
The 10-0 matchup phrase is used by some within the fighting game community to describe a fight between two specific characters where one is so dominant that it always wins in a best of 10 match - no matter what the opponent with the weaker character tries to do.

Some players have complained about the sun glare being so intense in Verdansk '84 that it causes visibility issues. It's particularly problematic when looking outside of a building from the inside, in certain sections of the map.
Responding to an article on Dexerto, Raven Software's lead VFX artist Reed Shingledecker tweeted to say: "I can easily tone it down if needed."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A French retailer has seemingly leaked an "EU version" of Sonic Collection for PlayStation 4.
It's the same company that may have outed that Sonic Colors remaster a few weeks back, too.
French site Sogamely boasts no cover art or release date, and right now only lists the game as coming to PS4 "soon". While that can only put this firmly in the take-with-a-giant-bucket-of-salt category, we do know that Sega is currently busy celebrating 30 years of Sonic, so a game collection is certainly a possibility (thanks, VGC). We've reached out to Sega for comment, though, and will update as/when we hear back.

The feedback now aggregates over 3000 reviews, 2.2K of which are deemed "mostly negative", despite a second hotfix that rolled out on Friday in a bid to address the game's stability (thanks, NME).
