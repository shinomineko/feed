        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft chief Yves Guillemot believes cloud streaming will be as transformative to gaming in the coming years as Netflix was to TV. 


Speaking with the Financial Times, Guillemot looked back on Netflix's initial foray into streaming and noted the market's early scepticism. "Their shares fell a lot and they were widely criticised," he recalled. "Today, we see what they have become."


Guillemot said he believes the same will eventually ring true for video game streaming as well, but admitted it will likely take some time. "But when it takes off, it will happen very quickly," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 players have discovered a bug that gives player one a distinct advantage.


Certain combos executed by player one cannot be replicated by player two, a problem that persists across all playable characters and even in online multiplayer modes.


YouTuber mrAPchem uploaded a video that demonstrates the issue (thanks TheGamer), setting up a Mirror Match with Sub-Zero and attempting the same combo as both player one and player two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 launched last week, and fans have been poring over newly added content to find all the Easter eggs  CD Projekt Red has crammed in.
One of the latest discoveries is an arcade cabinet which lets you play a Doom and Wolfenstein inspired minigame called Arasaka Tower 3D. In it, you play as Johnny Silverhand descending the 120 floors of Arasaka Tower in 2023 after he stormed the building in a bomb attack on the corporation. 
Complete with Keanu Reeves' face at the bottom of the screen, tight corridors and downsampled tracks from Cyberpunk 2077's OST, it's got 90s FPS written all over it. That's not all though, as players have also discovered it relates to the long-running FF:06:B5 Easter egg present in other CD Projekt Red games.

<p>Rather than Apple, Google, and Citizen Lab coordinating and accurately reporting the common origin of the vulnerability, they chose to use a separate CVE designation, the researchers said. The researchers concluded that &#8220;millions of different applications&#8221; would remain vulnerable until they, too, incorporated the libwebp fix. That, in turn, they said, was preventing automated systems that developers use to track known vulnerabilities in their offerings from detecting a critical vulnerability that&#8217;s under active exploitation...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The games' removal was first noticed by X (formerly Twitter) user MauroNL3, who noted "every FIFA title from 14 up to 23 can't be purchased anymore".


I went and had a quick look for myself, and can verify this to be true.

The Bethesda space RPG's many planets still feature environmental hazards, such as extreme temperatures and radiation. But the impact these have on your character is now fairly minimal - whereas previously this system would have seen players having to swap spacesuits to meet local conditions.


Bethesda boss Todd Howard revealed the change during an episode of the Game Maker's Notebook podcast, which is well worth a watch. In it, Howard discusses the challenges of creating interesting planets, fun space combat, and what changed during Starfield's development.

Prior to his departure in 2016, Metzen, who had been with Blizzard for 23 years at that point, was head writer and lore guru at the company (more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) with a hand in all the studio's properties.


Since rejoining Blizzard, however, Metzen has been solely focused on Warcraft (in the role of franchise creative advisor), and his new executive creative director position will continue in much the same vein, seeing Metzen focus exclusively on developing the Warfraft universe, initially with an eye on "crafting the next generation of [World of Warcraft] adventures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three years after making its PC debut as an Epic Games Store exclusive, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is coming to Steam, with its release date set for 3rd October.


Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 - which originally launched for PS4, Xbox One, and Epic back in September 2020 - combines remakes of developer Neversoft's much-loved skating games into a single, critically acclaimed package. The end result was an experience that thoroughly reinvigorated the two-decade old classics, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman even going as far as to call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 "one of the best games of the generation".


In the three years since its record-breaking release, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has made the jump to Switch, and developer Vicarious Visions (the esteemed studio responsible for the superb remakes) was merged into Blizzard - a move that sadly meant a planned Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 ultimately never saw the light of day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Talos Principle 2, Serious Sam studio Croteam's follow-up to its acclaimed 2014 first-person puzzle adventure, will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 2nd November.


The original Talos Principle served up an often fiendishly cerebral bout of puzzle-solving that played out something like Portal, albeit with a hell of a lot more lasers, a little bit of time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophy. Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle 'rooms' that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress.


As for The Talos Principle 2, it sounds like players can expect more of the same, and generally more all round. Croteam is promising new abilities, including gravity manipulation and mind transference, on top of the mechanics seen in the first game, and it'll all take place across "more than a dozen" new environments - said to be hiding long-buried secrets and forgotten history - that range from a city on the brink of a paradigm shift to the landscapes of a mysterious island.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, the supernatural action-RPG from Life is Strange studio Don't Nod, has been delayed to 13th February 2024 to avoid an "intense release cycle for AAA titles".


Banishers unfolds in the frozen North American wilderness, in the year 1695, where ghost hunters (and lovers) Antea Duarte and Red mac Rait are working to protect the living from the spectral dead. Their situation becomes somewhat more complicated when Antea suddenly finds herself unexpectedly dead and also a ghost.


Don't Nod and publisher Focus Entertainment had, as confirmed back in July, originally intended to release Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden on 7th November, but, in a short statement posted to Don't Nod's website today, Focus has now announced a three-month delay.

The information comes from reliable leaker Billbil-kun, who claims The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 will be added to the Essential tier of games for all PS Plus subscribers. 
The Callisto Protocol only came out in December last year, so this is a much cheaper way for those of you on PlayStation to play the game and try it out if you haven't bought it yet.

The game's listing on the App Store has the game available for free but with in-app purchases. Scrolling down, those purchases are listed in full with "Resident Evil 4 (with bonus)" priced at £57.99.


This is more expensive than as currently priced on Steam (£49.99) and PSN (£54.99), but similar to Xbox (£57.98). That's practically unheard of for a mobile game.

This slither comes from Craig Mazin, showrunner and co-creator of HBO's The Last of Us  adaptation, who has said work on season two will resume "the second" that strike action is officially lifted.


As a reminder, the Writers Guild of America has been on strike for almost five months. However, it was recently announced that a tentative agreement has been reached between the relevant parties for a new three-year contract, something that looks set to end the 146-day strike (thanks, Variety).

Nomura said he felt negatively towards the term, while Kitase was more accepting of its use to highlight the different approaches taken by Japanese game companies.


"I'm not too keen on it," Nomura told The Guardian in a new interview. "Certainly, when we started doing interviews for the games that I started making, no one used that term - they just called them RPGs. And then at some point - I can't remember exactly when - people started referring to them as JRPGs. And I'm not really sure what the intent behind that is. It just always felt a bit off to me, and a bit weird. I never really understood it - or why it's needed."

Of course, catching chocobo is nothing new for the series, but a new social post on X (formerly Twitter) from the game's official account shows how it'll work in Rebirth for the first time, with a video of Cloud catching one of the iconic yellow birds. 


The method actually looks similar to Breath of the Wild, with Cloud sneaking through foliage (and some conveniently spiky yellow flowers) and throwing out some greens as a distraction before mounting the bird.

As reported by PC Gamer, making a particular choice during one of the earlier story quests will lock you out of any future main quests. You can still explore Dogtown, but you won't get to spend time with Idris Elba. Why would you deprive yourself of that opportunity?

The choice which will lock you out is towards the end of Lucretia My Reflection, the fourth main quest. It's a fairly obvious one, but spoiler warning for below if you want to know exactly where it occurs.

Developer Rockstar is yet to announce a Switch edition of its Wild West prequel, and it is unclear when the Brazilian ratings board updated its site to include this version. However, this recent revelation comes just one month after the studio added the first Red Dead game to the Nintendo Switch's library.

While this does not guarantee the union will call a strike, the next bargaining session is this week, and this ratchets up the pressure. The leverage of this authorisation could compel movement on either side.

What a journey so far!
Starting from the initial blog post “How we made Kubernetes insanely easy to install” in September 2016, followed by an exciting growth that lead to general availability / “Production-Ready Kubernetes Cluster Creation with kubeadm” two years later.
And later on a continuous, steady and reliable flow of small improvements that is still going on as of today.
What is kubeadm? (quick refresher)
kubeadm is focused on bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters on existing infrastructure and performing an essential set of maintenance tasks. The core of the kubeadm interface is quite simple: new control plane nodes
are created by running kubeadm init and
worker nodes are joined to the control plane by running
kubeadm join.
Also included are utilities…]]></summary>

That tiny nugget of information comes via a new Ask me Anything (AMA) Q&A session, held earlier today on Reddit, in which Poncle occasionally had the opportunity to answer questions that weren't variations on 'Where the bloody hell are the vampires anyway, please?'.


One such question inquired if there were any multiplayer plans for Vampire Survivors beyond the four-player couch co-op mode introduced alongside the Switch release last month, to which Poncle replied in the affirmative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog has announced it'll be celebrating The Last of Us Day - its annual hat tip to the community - again this year, but has warned fans not to expect any game or TV show news.


This year's The Last of Us Day (which, if you're unfamiliar, happens on 26th September to commemorate the in-game date the Cordyceps infection reached critical mass) coincides with the series' tenth anniversary, meaning some fans were hoping developer Naughty Dog might have a few extra-special reveals to mark the occasion. 


Unfortunately, in a tweet clearly intended to manage expectations ahead of time, Naughty Dog wrote, "We're celebrating with a The Last of Us Day stream tomorrow... featuring announcements focused on art, merch, and more. While we're honouring the series' 10-year legacy, we will not be discussing any future game or TV show projects."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two weeks after getting its first small update, Starfield has just recieved another, this one focusing on performance and stability, as well as remedying a number of gameplay issues.


All-in-all, it's not a particularly glamorous update, equating to a grand total of ten bullet points in Bethesda's patch notes, but if you've been experiencing the likes of characters not appearing where they should be, blurry textures, or a hitch-y hand scanner, this one's for you.


Full patch details can be found below, and for those wondering when Bethesda might have something more substantial to bring to Starfield, the developer says it's "continuing to work on [the] larger update" that - as we learned a couple of weeks ago - will introduce the likes of Nvidia DLSS support and 32:9 ultrawide monitor support on PC, a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, and a new "Eat" button for food when it eventually arrives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a tumultuous week for Unity, in which the company infuriated a significant portion of the development community by making dramatic changes to its engine licensing terms - only to then partially walk them back - at least one developer has had enough, announcing it'll no longer be porting its acclaimed game to Switch as a direct consequence of Unity's actions.


Last Tuesday, Unity announced changes to its licensing agreement that would have forced developers to pay an additional fee every time a user installed their game. After significant outrage from the development community, with many accusing Unity of a betrayal of trust, the company changed course, saying its new pricing plan would now only apply to developers choosing to use its next Long Term Support version - but, as highlighted by developer Neognosis in a post announcing the cancellation of a Switch port for its acclaimed F-Zero-inspired racer BallisticNG, many developers might not have a choice but to upgrade.
 

"Nintendo has a rolling Unity version requirement for game releases," the studio explained, "and we're already behind the threshold by two years. Two weeks ago this wouldn't have been an issue... [but] by the time we'll have a Switch version of BallisticNG ready, the threshold for Unity versions will exceed the new versions that Unity are pushing their TOS changes with, and we currently have no confidence that they won't try pulling another move or pushing back to their original plans under/beyond this new TOS."

The lawsuit was filed on 8th July, as spotted by The Gamer, by a singular plaintiff on behalf of himself and class members, defined as "all persons in the State of California who purchased KOTOR for Nintendo during the relevant statute of limitations period, i.e. four years prior to the filing of the Complaint until present".


KOTOR 2 released on 8th June 2023 for Switch. It was initially advertised with plans to add a fan-made mod which restores content to the original game as DLC. On 3rd June 2023, Aspyr announced it was cancelling the Restored Content DLC and offered a "complimentary" key from a selection of other Star Wars games to those who had pre-purchased KOTOR 2.

The layoffs come following a period of dramatic growth for the game, which now commands 250 million monthly active users - more than Fortnite and Minecraft combined.


Reporting on the layoffs, Techcrunch said it believed the changes reflected a greater push within Roblox - which operates at a net loss - to focus in on its bottom line, which is heavily affected the growing sums it pays developers on its platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The arrival of Payday 3 has been plagued by server problems, leaving the game inaccessible at various times across its launch weekend.


Payday 3 was released on Thursday last week for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But as player numbers climbed, the game quickly got into problems. 


Now, in a statement issued this morning, the boss of Payday 3 developer Starbreeze said he was "disappointed" in how his company's big new launch had landed - and largely pointed the finger at an unnamed third-party matchmaking service for causing the game to fall over.

The kubeadm tool now supports etcd learner mode, which
allows you to enhance the resilience and stability
of your Kubernetes clusters by leveraging the learner mode
feature introduced in etcd version 3.4.
This guide will walk you through using etcd learner mode with kubeadm. By default, kubeadm runs
a local etcd instance on each control plane node.
In v1.27, kubeadm introduced a new feature gate EtcdLearnerMode. With this feature gate enabled,
when joining a new control plane node, a new etcd member will be created as a learner and
promoted to a voting member only after the etcd data are fully aligned.
What are the advantages of using etcd learner mode?
etcd learner mode offers several compelling reasons to consider its adoption

Despite recovering from persistent DDoS attacks that took down servers earlier this week, Destiny 2 is now experiencing a host of other errors and bugs, as well as possible further DDoS attacks that have players flocking to Bungie's social media channels to report in-game oddities.

As spotted by PCGN, the issues are numerous and wide-reaching, affecting everything from PvP scores to broken doors to enemies failing to see Guardians, let alone engaging with them.

As spotted by the fine folks at Gematsu, whilst the action horror game is free to download and lets anyone try out the opening sequences for free, you'll need ¥4990 – that's around £27 – to unlock the full game, and another ¥2000 (£11) to experience the "Winters' Expansion" DLC. 

And yes, the Resident Evil 4 Remake iDevice port is also still on track, too, although Capcom will only commit to a vague "2023" release. Unlike the older Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4 Remake will set you back ¥7990 (£44) and the newly-released DLC, Separate Ways, ¥1000 (£5.50). Again, you can download the game for free and give it a try before you buy.

While it's in no way indicative of an upcoming release date or anything like that – sorry – the changes to the storefront graphics are at least a sign that work is still underway behind the scenes, with the team twice uploading "capsule art" – that is, the artwork you see on the game's storefront – in the last week, the most recent of which was uploaded earlier today.

<blockquote><p>New research on fossils has revealed that a vampire-like ancient squid haunted Earth&#8217;s oceans 165 million years ago. The study, published in June edition of the journal <i>Papers in Palaeontology</i>, says the creature had a bullet-shaped body with luminous organs, eight arms and sucker attachments. The discovery was made by scientists in France, who used modern imaging technique to analyse the previously discovered fossils. The ancient squid has been named Vampyrofugiens atramentum, which stands for the &#8220;fleeing vampire&#8221;. The researchers said that these features have never been recorded before...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten days after Unity successfully enraged huge swathes of the development community by announcing sweeping, and wildly unpopular, changes to its Unity Engine business model, the company has said it's "sorry" and walked back on significant aspects of its new pricing plan.


Last Tuesday, Unity announced that, as of 1st January 2024, developers would be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install on top of their existing licence subscription after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash was immediate and intense, resulting in minor revisions to Unity's initial plan.


Now though, Unity's Marc Whitten has outlined significant changes to last week's announcement in a post on the company's website, beginning with another apology. "I want to start with this: I am sorry," he wrote. "We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback before announcing our new Runtime Fee policy. Our goal with this policy is to ensure we can continue to support you today and tomorrow, and keep deeply investing in our game engine."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Total War: Pharaoh next month, on 11th October, there's a bit of bad news - for some purchasers, at least: developer Creative Assembly has announced it's delaying the title into "early 2024", but only on the Epic Games Store.


It's a bit of an unusual one this, but Creative Assembly says the situation has arisen because it was "recently asked to help support the integration of social functions before we can launch on the Epic Games Store, and we'll need additional time to help make that happen".


Importantly, though, Total War: Pharaoh's 11th October release will remain unchanged on Steam - and all pre-orders made on Epic have been automatically cancelled, should you want to take your business elsewhere. Creative Assembly says all affected customers should receive an email confirming this cancellation directly from the Epic Games Store support team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has once again dropkicked the dreams right out of anyone hoping a whizzier, more powerful Steam Deck might be happening soon; it's now provided a clearer timeframe for what it considers to be the current Steam Deck's minimum life span, saying not to expect any kind of performance upgrade "in the next couple of years".


Valve has, of course, tempered expectations for a souped-up Steam Deck sequel previously; in December, Deck designer Pierre-Loup Griffais said the company would likely keep a single performance spec, ie. the current one, for its handheld gaming PC "a little bit longer", noting any initial hardware improvements would probably focus on screen and battery capacity.


But now, speaking to The Verge, Griffais has indicated that "little bit" will likely be a lot longer, and that any Steam Deck performance upgrades are still some considerable way off. "It's important to us that the Deck offers a fixed performance target for developers," he explained, "and that the message to customers is simple, where every Deck can play the same games."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you cast your minds back to 2020, you may recall Spider-Man being a hot topic of conversation. This was not because he had just used his web-tastic athleticism to save a school bus of children from careering off the side of the road, or swept MJ off her feet (literally) before kissing her while upside down. 


Rather, he was a topic of conversation because Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games remastered its original 2018 game for the PlayStation 5, and at the same time changed up the look of its unmasked hero, Peter Parker. 


While Insomniac said this new model was a better reflection of actor Yuri Lowenthal's facial capture, it caused a certain amount of upset for fans of the original. In fact, when the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man released last year, mods were made to bring Peter Parker's original face back into the game. But, perhaps we should all be less concerned about the two different facial models for Peter and move on. After all, that's what his actor wants. In fact, he just wants people to "get over it".

Players can now change their character's appearance by finding the Magic Mirror in camp. Everything other than race and subrace of your character can be altered - though it also can't be used to get rid of any "cosmetic modifications that are a consequence of your gameplay choices". Also, origin characters, hirelings and full illithids can't use the Magic Mirror.
Patch three has also added full support for the game on Mac, with Larian Studios recommending any players on Mac remove any mods and reinstall the game fresh before playing.

Scheduled to release in February 2024, Part 2 will debut its new storyline on Mars, a new location for Impact 3rd, which previously contained its galactic adventures on Earth and its moon. Previously thought uninhabitable in Honkai lore, Mars actually offers a "unique civilization and nature"  where "there may also be mysteries hidden behind the daily lives of residents that have yet to be discovered".
In addition to expanding its reach further into the solar system, Part 2 debuts a cast of "new partners from different cultures", introducing brand new main characters and NPCs alongside our shiny new playable character, a Martian native team supporter named Dreamseeker.

Tales of the Shire was announced to celebrate Hobbit Day, and promises to provide a snuggly "heart-warming" experience set in Tolkein's Middle-earth universe. It's coming from Wētā Workshop and Private Division and will arrive sometime next year. Needless to say, I am more than a little bit excited.


To accompany this announcement, a small teaser was also released. It is short and suitably charming, showing a young person humming as she sits at a table strewn with flora and art supplies. There are also modern bits and pieces, such as headphones. She is painting in a book, and while I have nothing to base this on other than my hunch, she looks to be painting herself as a hobbit. Could this be Tales of the Shire's soon to be pint-sized protagonist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a positive development for Microsoft, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has "provisionally concluded" the company's revised deal to purchase Activision Blizzard will be enough to grant approval.


Back in April, the CMA made the shock decision to block Microsoft's proposed deal to acquire the Call of Duty maker. At this time, the regulatory body cited concerns relating to the cloud gaming sector, stating that the deal risked "stifling competition in this growing market".


In August, Microsoft submitted a revised proposal in a bid to appease the regulator, saying it would now sell the streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard games released in the next 15 years to Ubisoft should the new deal be accepted.

News of The Division 3's existence comes not via a flashy announcement trailer or Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot bellowing the news through a megaphone while sat astride a glitter cannon, but instead tucked away in a press release announcing something else entirely.


Specifically, Ubisoft today disseminated a press release among news outlets announcing that Julian Gerighty - the creative director of next year's eagerly anticipated Star Wars Outlaws - has been appointed new executive producer of its Tom Clancy's The Division brand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seeing everything there is to see in developer Larian Studios' ludicrously vast Baldur's Gate 3 is already something of an impossible task, but Astarion actor Neil Newbon has now raised the stakes even higher, claiming it features a two-hour secret section that no-one's yet found.


During one of Newbon's regular Twitch livestreams, aired at the end of last month (thanks GamesRadar), the voice of everyone's favourite perfectly coiffured glampire teased that, "There's even something I know about that you can't get to unless you do something that I don't think anyone's going to work out".


Sadly, Newbon - who was told about the mysterious "two hours of content" in confidence and is likely "one of the few people that knows about it" - wouldn't even offer a "vague clue or hint" when asked. He did, however, tease that "at some point, somebody will find it for a very specific reason" - so it seems like getting to the bottom of this one will be squarely in the Baldur's Gate 3 community's court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its Tokyo Game Showcase, Capcom has shared nine minutes of new Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay footage, this time focusing on vocations - basically the series' version of classes - as well as offering a little look at some of the major locations in its world.


At the game's outset, Dragon's Dogma provides a choice between four vocations - fighter, mage, thief, and archer - each determining a player's style of play, but more will become available as events progress - and vocations can be changed by visiting Vocation Guilds, should you want to mix things up.


The fighter, for instance, specialises in one-handed sword and shield combat for short-range attacks and defensive manoeuvring. The archer, meanwhile, is better suited to taking down enemies - which are said to be behave organically out the world - from a distance using their bow and arrow, which can support the likes of exploding and blighting arrows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five and a half years and endless requests from the community later, Rare has announced it'll finally be adding private servers to Sea of Thieves - meaning a single crew of up to four players can explore the world without fear of PvP encounters - starting this December, as part of the multiplayer pirate adventure's Season 10.


Season 10 itself gets underway on 19th October, and will introduce a major new feature each month ahead of 2024 - essentially meaning all content originally planned for 2023 will arrive before the end of the year, despite a painfully protracted, seven-month-long Season 9.


First up, on 19th October, Sea of Thieves will introduce Guilds, described as a "new way for players to form meaningful bonds beyond their immediate crew". Essentially, any player that's reached Captain status and has their own ship can start a guild - picking a name, logo, and emblem when then do so - which can then support up to 24 invited players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Now, the latest free-to-play Pokémon Go-style augmented reality creature-battler from developer Niantic, made in collaboration with Capcom, has officially surpassed 5m downloads in its first week of release on iOS and Android.


Monster Hunter Now, which was announced back in February and got its full launch on 21st September following a series of closed beta tests, employs a similar real-world exploration and interaction system to the ones seen in the likes of Niantic's Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom, albeit with an obvious Monster Hunter twist.


Here, players are able to gather useful resources and fight monsters they encounter while out on their real-world travels - including the Barroth, Tobi Kadachi, Jyuratodus, Paolumu, Anjanath, Rathian, Rathalos, and Diablos - then combine their spoils to create better equipment that'll enable them to take on tougher challenges.

This closed alpha will be accessible to players who sign up for an account at Everywhere.game.


A new trailer for Everywhere, released today, shows some of the biomes you can explore and play around with in the game, as well as some swooping camera pans through its Ready Player One-style hub. There's also a glimpse at some of the types of mini-games you can build and a brief look at the game's editor mode, which lets you tweak creations you've made on the fly.

Confirmed sale dates include the usual Spring Sale, the next edition of Steam Next Fest, and a number of themed events.

This upcoming release is a time-looping action game from Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro and Goichi "Suda51" Suda, two legends of game development. It promises to serve us all up some "2.5D slasher film parodic action".


So, what's it actually all about? Well, Hotel Barcelona is where America's serial killers have all decided to reconvene. And, according to the official trailer blurb, players will need to defeat this murderous bunch and "check out before all the blood is spilled".

This all stems from the game's description of its offline (and online) multiplayer, which originally read: "Paw it out with your friends both online and offline".


But Party Animals does not have an offline mode. As a result, many owners have left negative comments about the release.

It also revealed email exchanges between Microsoft's execs, where Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond and others discussed potential games for the company's Game Pass subscription service. 


One such game was Baldur's Gate 3, the recent hit from developer Larian. As we previously reported, Microsoft estimated it would take $5m to get Baldur's Gate 3 on Game Pass, with the company dubbing the game a "second-run Stadia PC RPG".


Needless to say, given the huge success of Baldur's Gate 3, Microsoft underestimated its potential. But Larian isn't mad about this. Rather, it has said it understands the situation, with the studio's director of publishing Michael Douse saying it "comes with the genre".

It's now receiving more criticism thanks to the official trailer posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel, which seemingly includes PC gameplay to advertise the Switch version of the game.

"A handful of sequences depict more intense acts of violence," the ESRB writes, including a mission which includes "terrorists (dressed as police officers and paramedics) shooting/killing fleeing civilians inside a stadium concourse".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After two rip-roaring outings, Sea of Thieves' wonderful Monkey Island adventure will soon reach its end; Rare has now confirmed its third and final instalment will launch next Thursday, 28th September - clearing the way for the pirate game's tenth season on 19th October.


Sea of Thieves' three-part The Legend of Monkey Island adventure got underway back in July, sending players on a quest to Mêlée Island where, thanks to the mysterious power of the Sea of the Damned, Guybrush Threepwood had become the mightiest pirate of all. It was a wonderful opening episode, managing to capture the magic (if perhaps not the humour) of the point-and-click classic, and things only got better in last month's vastly more open-ended part two.


Episode three, titled The Lair of LeChuck, whisks players away to an absolutely gorgeous rendition of Monkey Island itself - which you can see a bit of at the 4:49 mark in Sea of Thieves' latest news update below - spanning everything from dense jungle to lava-filled catacombs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glen Schofield, the co-creator of Dead Space, is departing his Striking Distance Studios following the commercial failure of its first game, sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol. 


Schofield founded Striking Distance Studios in 2019, under the wing of a Korean publisher Krafton Inc., which was looking to create a narrative-based game that would expand its PUBG: Battlegrounds universe - although, notably, all connections to PUBG had been excised by the time The Callisto Protocol launched in December last year.


Unfortunately, The Callisto Protocol's critical reception was mixed and the game was met with lower-than-anticipated sales. In January, it was reported that Krafton had expected to shift five million copies of The Callisto Protocol - whose three-year development had cost it £132m - but that it was unlikely to hit its target, given just two million copies had been sold at the time.

Bloodlines 2 has, of course, had a tumultuous journey since its unveiling back in 2019; original developer Hardsuit Labs was ditched following a number of controversies, almost resulting in the cancellation of the game, but Paradox eventually confirmed development had been handed to a new studio, now known to be The Chinese Room, sometime in 2021.


Bloodlines 2's re-reveal earlier this month was fairly light on detail, but Paradox did say the game would cast players as an Elder vampire in the "dark underbelly of Seattle, where vampires struggle for survival and supremacy". It also confirmed there'd be characters for players to chat with, combat, a need to keep a low profile to ensure vampire society stays hidden from humanity, and "complex political relationships".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UK regulatory body the Competition and Markets Authority is reportedly preparing to share its preliminary judgement on Microsoft's revised Activision Blizzard deal next week.


The CMA is, of course, Microsoft's last remaining hurdle in getting its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard over the finish line after the UK regulator made the shock decision to block the deal in April, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk "stifling competition in this growing market". 


Following the CMA's decision - and the Federal Trade Commission's failure to secure a temporary halt on the deal in a US court - Microsoft returned to the UK regulator with a revised proposal, saying it would sell the streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard games released in the next 15 years to Ubisoft should the new deal be approved.

A smaller "core group" within Criterion will continue on with Need for Speed, meanwhile.


Criterion has of course worked on Battlefield before, and contributed bits to DICE's Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 (it also helped out on Star Wars Battlefront 2). The talented team will now turn its efforts back to improving 2042, and to the future of the Battlefield franchise overall.

The adaptation was revealed a year ago byCapcom, along with a few stills from the show. Its protagonist is Musashi Miyamoto, whose likeness is modelled after prolific Japanese actor Mifune Toshiro (best known for his roles in Akira Kurosawa's films including Seven Samurai). The series is directed by Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer, 13 Assassins).

The new trailer shows snippets of action sequences and reveals hints of the plot. Netflix describes the first episode as "the beginning of an intense series full of realistic action in which Musashi's blade slices through evil as he traverses a land plagued by poverty".

Thanks to the huge leak of documents accidentally uploaded by Microsoft to the US FTC, we now know why the PS5 version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon was released later than its Xbox next-gen counterparts. 
In a series of emails dated 1st June 2020, Xbox execs Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond, and Damon Baker (who has since left Microsoft and joined publisher Kepler Interactive) discuss how the company essentially ended up with a timed exclusive on next-gen consoles thanks to a number of caveats with certain deals struck between itself, Sega and Sony.

Bluey the cartoon follows the adventures of the eponymous Blue Heeler dog, her sister Bingo, mum Chilli, and dad Bandit. All are along for the ride in Bluey: The Videogame, which promises an "interactive sandbox adventure" for up to four players, featuring fully explorable recreations of some of the show's most recognisable locations.


There's talk of "story-driven episodic gameplay", split into four parts, that'll include activities and mini-games inspired by the cartoon - Keepy Uppy and Magic Xylophone are mentioned - with players able to unlock new costumes, stickers, episodes, and locations as they go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saber Interactive has announced it's ending development of last year's Evil Dead: The Game - meaning no new content will be produced and the planned Switch version is now cancelled.


Evil Dead: The Game - which launched onto Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last May - is another entry in the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre that's already bought us the likes of Dead by Daylight and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this one pitting a cast of familiar faces from the Evil Dead movies, including Bruce Campbell's Ash Williams, against the Deadite hordes.


Since its release, sporadic post-launch support has introduced a castle map inspired by Army of Darkness, new outfits, a number of characters, the new Plaguebringer class, and a new Splatter Royale mode. April saw the previously Epic Games Store-exclusive title make the jump to Steam on PC, but content updates fizzled out after that - and now Saber Interactive has confirmed development has reached its end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 20/9/23: Following the release of Xbox boss Phil Spencer's public statement on social media addressing recent leaks, The Verge has obtained a copy of a more substantial internal memo circulated among Microsoft employees:


"Today, several documents submitted in the court proceedings related to our proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard were unintentionally disclosed. I know this is disappointing, even if many of the documents are well over a year old and our plans have evolved.


"I also know we all take the confidentiality of our plans and our partners’ information very seriously. This leak obviously is not us living up to that expectation. We will learn from what happened and be better going forward. We all put incredible amounts of passion and energy into our work, and this is never how we want that hard work to be shared with the community. That said, there’s so much more to be excited about, and when we’re ready, we’ll share the real plans with our players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following today's mega-sized Xbox leak - which has given us word of a planned digital-only Xbox Series X/S refresh and new controller, a tantalising Bethesda release roadmap, first details of a brand-new Xbox in 2028, confirmation Xbox boss Phil Spencer is awfully keen to buy Nintendo, and more - the US Federal Trade Commission has stepped forward to quell any bubbling conspiracy theories and emphatically state it was not responsible (it was Microsoft).


Today's barrage of Xbox news all came from confidential Xbox documents, dated April 2022, that were originally shared by Microsoft as part of the FTC's case against the company's proposed $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. These documents then surfaced publicly last night, providing access to a treasure trove of fully unredacted internal details.


Predictably, internet conspiracy theories have ebbed and flowed throughout to the day regarding who might be have been responsible for the leak and why - but the FTC has moved to make it abundantly clear it wasn't involved, begining with a statement from Douglas Farrar, the commission's office of public affairs director, on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8's Closed Network Tests are regrettably no more (regrettable if you too find unintended joy in unfortunately selected acronyms), as Bandai Namco has announced it'll be launching the fighter's first Closed Beta Test this October. 


So while we must sadly bid a fond farewell to the publisher's eye-catching Tekken 8 CNT graphic, we do at least get to snicker at its replacement (I'm assuming nobody at Bandai Namco thought to run 'CBT' through the internet first either) when the next bout of testing gets underway at 8am BST on 20th October. Proceedings will run until 9am on 23rd October, with three hours of downtime scheduled between 9am and 12pm on the 21st.


Once again, players across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Steam can get involved (Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus subscriptions are not required), and once again places are limited, so those interested in participating will need to register their interest beforehand. Registration closes at 8am on 11th October and successful applicants will be notified starting at 8am on the 18th. Additionally, Bandai Namco notes successful CNT entrants can play without re-registering.

For instance, Microsoft estimated it would take $300m to get Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on Game Pass, or $250m for either Mortal Kombat 1 or Suicide Squad.


As we reported earlier today, a 2022 email thread initiated by Phil Spencer had Microsoft scrambling to fill the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield's delay and included a long list of potential third-party games.

He continued: "I expressed my concerns at the end of June because video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks. It is this violence that I condemn, not video games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're discussing what feels like the biggest leak of Xbox gaming news in history, which has left Microsoft's plans to launch new hardware in 2024 and a new console generation in 2028 exposed. 
Next year's redesigned Xbox Series X is digital only, according to documents from 2022 that Microsoft presented to the FTC this year. It does not appear to boast a bump in processing power - something that gels with what Xbox boss Phil Spencer told me at Gamescom last month - but also ditches the ability to play older games on disc. How does that square with Microsoft's push for game preservation?
Looking further ahead, Microsoft has pinned 2028 as the year we'll finally see the Xbox Series X's proper successor arrive. Is that too late? And what does it mean that the console will support "cloud hybrid" games?

The entire thread has since been deleted, though developer Gaijin Entertainment confirmed the information had been posted onto its forum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phil Spencer admitted the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield's delay was a "disaster situation" and suggested FromSoftware's Dark Souls games to plug the gap following the success of Elden Ring, among other third-party releases.


Today's enormous leak of internal Microsoft documents includes a particularly candid email from Spencer sent in May 2022, revealing his frustration around "a huge hole with our games lineup". That was due to Starfield's delay, "not a tonne of clarity on the launch date of Redfall", and Stalker 2 development impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.


"We keep talking about a big AAA a quarter in the service [Game Pass] and it feels like we are likely to go through a gap of almost 16 months between big exclusive launches on our platform," Spencer lamented.

Larian noted last night that "some PS5 players" were "experiencing sudden Baldur's Gate 3 crashes in what appears to be a PSN-related issue".


"We're investigating the problem," Larian continued, via a post on X, formerly Twitter. "But for now, the workaround is to disconnet your PS5 from the internet."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadows of Doubt, the ambitious procedural detective noir sandbox from developer Cole Jefferies, is introducing new cases themed around infidelity on 25th September, as part of its first major update since entering Steam early access in April.


Shadows of Doubt, for those in need of a quick refresher, is a first-person, open-world detective sim set in a noirish sci-fi city. Its unique selling point, however, is that procedural generation governs virtually every aspect of it in a bid to create an endlessly replayable crime-solving caper - from the layout of its city streets to the schedules of its citizens, right through to the cases you'll need to solve through stealth, subtrefuge, and sleuthing.


And from next Monday, 25th September, come the arrival of its Cheats and Liars update, Shadows of Doubt will have another trick in its toolbox - as players might just find themselves asked to investigate cases of infidelity, should it suit the procedural generation's whims.

The Home Chef Hustle Stuff Pack essentially features four components: there's new kitchen decor, new cooking attire, new small appliances, plus the ability to cart all your culinary creations out into the street to sell at a food stall and make some Simoleons along the way.


In terms of decor, you get counters, cabinets, and matching home appliances (oven, fridge, and dishwasher to be specific), all taking a cue from European designs, while the new small appliances come in the form of a Stand Mixer, Waffle Maker, and Countertop Pizza Oven - the latter also capable of cooking focaccia bread if pizza isn't your thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week after Unity announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model - drawing immediate and widespread condemnation from the development community - the company has reportedly told staff it'll be making adjustments to the controversial new pricing plan.


As reported by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, Unity leadership addressed employees in an all-hands meeting held earlier today (a meeting originally planned for late last week was cancelled following a "potential threat" from an employee), saying the company was "considering" introducing a cap on its hugely unpopular new per-install fees.


Unity initially caused an outcry last Tuesday, when it told developers that, on top of their existing Unity Engine licence subscription, they'd be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee each time a user installed their game, starting on 1st January 2024. This would apply to all games, including those already on the market, that had made $200k USD or more in the last 12 months and had at least 200k lifetime game installs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In news that isn't likely to be much of a surprise to anyone at this point, a newly unearthed Microsoft court document has confirmed The Elder Scrolls 6 won't be making its way to PlayStation when it eventually shows up in 2026 or beyond.


Microsoft submitted the document (thanks The Verge) as part of its court battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard - the same court proceedings that saw Xbox boss Phil Spencer answer an FTC attorney's questions about The Elder Scrolls 6's Xbox exclusivity by saying, "I think we've been a little unclear on what platforms it's launching on, given how far out the game is. It's difficult for us right now to nail down... It's so far out it's hard to understand what the platforms will even be at this point."


Despite Spencer's noncommital answer back in June, Microsoft's newly released court documents make it explicitly clear The Elder Scrolls 6 won't be coming to a PlayStation console.

Emails between Activision executives - made public as part of the FTC's court case with Microsoft and published today by The Verge, albeit with many redactions - show that the company's controversial boss Bobby Kotick spoke with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa about Switch 2 at the end of 2022.


Activision exec Chris Schnakenberg noted that the console was expected to be weigh in with a "closer alignment to Gen 8 platforms in terms of performance", referring to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's quite hard to believe it, but yes - yesterday marked 10 years since GTA 5 first released on PS3 and Xbox 360. 


It's undoubtedly become a milestone of recent gaming history, driven by an impressive figure of over 160m lifetime sales, critical reception, and endless controversies from developer Rockstar Games and its parent company Take-Two. The popular multiplayer mode, GTA Online, continues to stand the test of time as Rockstar continually adds new updates and content. 


As Rockstar works on GTA 6 and Take-Two suggests it might be released as early as next year, now feels like an appropriate moment to take stock of the achievements, missteps, and musings that surround GTA 5.

In fact, the version available on Nintendo's hybrid console has been widely panned, with many wondering how the developer can ask the same price on Switch as on other platforms. 


Fans have taken to the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok to question NetherRealm's decision to market Mortal Kombat 1 as a $70 Switch release. It has been called "robbery" and "disrespectful" to users.

This morning, Unity said it was sorry for the "confusion and angst" its changes had caused, and promised it would make unspecified "changes" to its plans.

For a long time, however, very little was done for Titanfall 2's small but dedicated fanbase, but now it seems Respawn has not only addressed the server issues, but also got Titanfall fans excited that something new may be on the horizon, too.

"As of now, 15 September 2023, the comic book property called Fables, including all related Fables spin-offs and characters, is now in the public domain," Willingham wrote on his substack. "What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time. It’s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible."

Wondering why Willingham has done this? You're not alone. The author said he's made the decision to move everything into the public domain for "a number of reasons", including "practicality" – Willingham feels much has changed since he first signed his contract with DC Comics – and "philosophy", as his "thoughts on how to reform the trademark and copyright laws in this country (and others, I suppose) have undergone something of a radical transformation".

The patch notes reveal that for both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, improvements include "fleshed out" accessibility options – see below – as well as character "polish and tuning", "improved and refined" UI, and the addition of "numerous finishing moves".

There are also some tweaks to the online system, including improvements to the matchmaking and "online mode bugs", with the story campaign getting a little TLC, too, including movie player improvements, 4K resolution, the tuning of "story finale and final boss", plus a liberal application of "visual polish" to a number of cinematic sequences.

"Asking direct questions to look forward and build a better, progressive future for women in games and esports around the world", the online conference will take place on 10th October, 2023. Tickets cost £30.

"From questions based on original research about representation such as 'What's going wrong with women's dialogue in video games?', to questions from returning innovators about pay such as 'Salary Transparency: Breaking the Game or Path to Success?', the Women in Games Annual Global Conference will offer abundant challenges to the prevailing lack of fairness, whether that be in work or play environments," a press release says.

In a concise update posted to Steam, Starbreeze simply said hello to its heisters and revealed in no-nonsense terms that "Denuvo is no longer in Payday 3".

The update comes a few weeks after fans shared screenshots within the Payday subreddit that intimated Payday 3 would feature the controversial anti-piracy software. Two months later, however, the Steam storefront has been updated, and Denuvo is no longer listed (thanks, PC Gamer).

Well then Sony might just, depending on your idea of tasteful, have what you're looking for: three new metallic console covers (and matching controllers) that are almost certainly not going to match your existing decor!


Sony's newly announced Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue, and Sterling Silver cover/controller combos are, according to a post on the PlayStation Blog, inspired by the "beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth" - all of which have then bee "elevated" with a metallic finish for a "touch of sophistication."


Those interested in giving their PS5 a "Deep Earth" makeover can, when the appropriate time comes, pick up each of the three shiny new covers for £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 USD, while the DualSense controllers (sold separately) will each cost £64.99/€74.99/$74.99 USD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frictional Games fans could be forgiven for thinking the horror-focused studio has been getting a little soft in recent years, having introduced death-free and monster-free modes in post-launch updates for its acclaimed SOMA and Amnesia: Rebirth. This year, though, it's going in completely the opposite direction, and its recently launched WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker will be getting even more nerve-frayingly horrifying, just in time for Halloween.


As spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun, Frictional's creative lead Fredrik Olsson has recently been using social media to detail some of the delightfully sadistic new features coming to Amnesia: The Bunker soon in what will known as Shell Shocked mode.


For starters, players who've been relying on the comparative tranquility of The Bunker's Admin Office safe room to emotionally, physically, and mentally regroup will, in Shell Shocked mode, be a little bit screwed. Now, its reassuringly sturdy steel doors will be replaced wood, which, you know, isn't all that resistant to scrambling, pounding, shredding monster claws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Montreal - the studio behind the likes of Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Far Cry 5 - has been accused of leaving staff in "turmoil" after it reportedly reneged on promises that "100% remote work would be possible", forcing all 4,000 of its workers back to the office for a "minimum" of two days a week, as of 11th September.


Back in June 2021, Ubisoft announced it would be adopting a "hybrid and tailored approach to work arrangements" where staff would be able "to balance in-office work with work from home". However, according to a new report by IGN, Ubisoft Montreal staff were repeatedly told they could remain 100% remote long-term, leading many to make significant life decision or accept jobs at the company based around these assurances.


"100% remote work will be possible depending on various criteria," reads an internal Ubisoft document seen by IGN and detailed in its report, "such as productivity and impact on the team, as well as the nature of the work being done."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Truck Simulator trundles ever-onward, and developer SCS Software has now confirmed its next stop (after the already announced but not-yet-released stops of Kansas and Nebraska, that is) will be the state of Arkansas.


This marks something of an interesting (I realise your mileage may vary on this point) deviation for SCS, which has so far been making its way across the US map in a bottom-to-top, left-to-right fashion, starting with California. This latest news means once Kansas and Nebraska are released, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Louisiana will be missing from the expected progression.


Arkansas, the so-called Natural State (mine is "asleep"), will be American Truck Simulator's 16th state when it arrives at some currently undisclosed future point, and SCS Software's rendition promises everything from "stunning mountain vistas to towering forests".

A new release date trailer for the game was shown at last night's PlayStation State of Play, which included a shot of Cloud and Sephiroth together in battle. In a follow-up interview on the PlayStation Blog, creative director Tetsuya Nomura confirmed Sephiroth will be playable.


"If you played the original Final Fantasy 7, I'm sure you can guess which scene I'm talking about," he said. "You will be able to control Sephiroth in the same scene in this title as you did in the original."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As revealed in PlayStation's recent State of Play, Honaki: Star Rail is coming to PS5 on 11th October, 2023.


Developed by HoYoverse, the company behind Genshin Impact, Star Rail is an anime-styled turn-based RPG with a gacha system, and has already been in the hands of PC and mobile players for five months.


While Star Rail is a free download, you can purchase its PS5 "pre-order" bundle for £9.49 to get some in-game items when it releases, and the ability to pre-download the game on PS5. But these in-game items are fairly unhelpful in the grand scheme of getting and building characters, especially when compared to its battle pass, the "Nameless Honor", which upgrades its free track to premium for £9.99 and offers far more helpful materials and weapons.

We've had a couple of glimpses of Rebirth since its announcement back in June 2022, and we know it'll unsurprisingly be picking up the story from 2020's Final Fantasy 7 Remake and later InterMISSION DLC - although "preparations" are being made to help you catch up if you can't be bothered to play through either of those beforehand.


"After escaping from the dystopian city of Midgar," developer Square Enix explains, "Cloud and his friends set out on a journey across the planet. New adventures await in a vibrant and vast world – sprint across grassy plains on a Chocobo and explore expansive environments."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During this evening's Sony State of Play, Insomniac Games revealed some more information about next month's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ahead of its release on 20th October.

The game's map has almost doubled in size, with the addition of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City. To help Peter and Miles swing across the larger map, they can now use web wings to traverse faster. The game uses a new fast travel system which is unlocked through the district progress systesm, and Insomniac says players will experience "very little downtime" when using fast travel.
The HUD for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 looks more organic, as markers for activities and quests players have already discovered will appear across New York City. This is explained in-game as AR technology in the lenses of the Spider-Masks which, given the technology already used by characters in the Spider-Man universe, Peter and Miles probably sorely need.

Separate Ways, if you're unfamiliar, was introduced to Resident Evil 4 when the game made the jump from GameCube to PlayStation 2 in 2005. It focuses on enigmatic spy Ada Wong, who briefly pops up in the Leon S. Kennedy-starring main campaign - filling in the blanks of her whereabouts over the course of the story.


A Resident Evil 4 Remake version of Separate Ways was first spotted by dataminer Gosetsu back in March, and Capcom has now made it official, confirming it'll release for $9.99 USD - alongside a free update to Resident Evil 4's wave-based Mercenaries mode introducing Ada Wong and Albert Wesker - on 21st September.

Cyberpunk 2.0 aims to address some of the criticism levied at the game since its controversial launch at the tail-end of 2020, promising completely redesigned skill trees and perks, revamped cyberware, a new capacity system, vehicle combat and car chases, combat AI improvements, and a new police system. It also brings changes to loot, items, and crafting, as well as UI and UX improvements, and a new selection of radio stations.


In other words, Cyberpunk's 2.0 update touches on a broad range of core systems in a significant fashion - and CD Projekt has been attempting to explain how these changes will impact the experience across a recent series of developer streams.

Today's State of Play is focused on "previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles", including PlayStation VR2, Sony said yesterday - so don't expect any big new reveals. Specifically, these will be for third-party games - so don't plan for any of Sony's own internal studios to pop up either. 


There's still plenty that could feature, though - including Square Enix games such as Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth and also Foamstars. What are you hoping to see?

News of the temporary closures first began circulating earlier today as Unity employees shared the news on social media. "Hey y'all, just a reminder to think before you target Unity employees," senior XR product designer Javier Busto wrote. "This morning we learned that law enforcement notified several Unity offices of credible threats."


Bloomberg's Jason Schreier later elaborated on those initial reports, writing that a "credible death threat" had resulted in the closer of two Unity offices - in San Francisco and Austin, Texas - as well as the cancellation of a town hall meeting that would have seen Unity CEO John Riccitiello addressing staff following Tuesday's widely lambasted pricing changes.

MobileGamer sources say Unity has already offered some studios a 100% fee waiver - if they switch over to Unity's own LevelPlay ad platform. 


The report quotes industry consultants that say this move is an "attempt to destroy" Unity's main competitior in this field: AppLovin.

The Direct's line-up, including an F-Zero 99 announcement,  and big finale, a port of the beloved Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, were fan-pleasing additions to the Switch's bulging catalogue.


And they are perhaps the kind of smaller announcements we'd expect at this point, for a platform widely-expected to be replaced next year. Still, as we saw, there's plenty of life left for the next six months at least - and beyond?

A enhanced version of Luigi's Mansion 2 (originally titled Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon when it launched for 3DS back in 2013) was initially unveiled in June, but today's Nintendo Direct offered a substantially longer look at its spooky ghost-hoovering action.


The twist in Luigi's Mansion 2, if you're unfamiliar with the original, is that it plays out across not just one ghost-infested haunted dwelling, but five - starting with the kind of classic spook house seen in its GameCube predecessor, and continuing through the likes of a former research lab, run-down clock factory, snowy mine, and more.

The goal each level is to retrieve a key and get it to the exit, requiring both observation and brain work to navigate the obstacles using levers, platforms, and other wrinkles to grab the mini-Marios and progress to the next area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stig Asmussen, the director behind the acclaimed Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, is leaving Respawn Entertainment and EA to "pursue other adventures".


Asmussen, whose career in the games industry spans close to 25 years, worked on all three original God of War titles at Santa Monica Studio prior to his move to Respawn - serving as lead environment artist, then art director, and, finally, creative director on God of War 3. 


He joined Respawn Entertainment as a game director in 2014, and his first released project at the studio was 2019's well-received Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. A follow-up, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, also helmed by Asmussen, released earlier this year, proving to be a commercial hit.

Proceedings get underway at 6pm in the UK/1pm EDT, and viewers can expect around an hour of chat - which will include "on-the-horizon news and updates" - covering both Minecraft and this year's action-strategy spin-off, Minecraft: Legends.


As for this year's community mob vote (mobs, if you're unfamiliar with Minecraft parlance, are basically enemies), it'll offer a choice between three new mobs - which Mojang will reveal at the "beginning of October" - and take place via the Minecraft Launcher, Minecraft.net, or the special event server on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

As detailed on Bethesda's website, the studio is initially targeting a "few top issues" in a small hotfix out today, after which it'll be turning its attention to various community requested features, which will arrive in updates at a "regular interval".


Specifically, it's confirmed Nvidia DLSS Support on PC following its controversial partnership with AMD, as well as 32:9 ultrawide monitor support on the platform. Additionally, players can expect a range of quality of life improvements, including a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, plus brightness and contrast controls. Oh, and also, more convenient, efficient consumption through the power of a new "Eat" button for food.

The company has subsequently softened its stance slightly on a couple of aspects - but fury across the industry remains.

Behind the scenes, CEO John Riccitiello shifted 2000 shares last week on 6th September, as noted by Yahoo Finance, which noted this move was part of a trend over the past year where the exec has sold more than 50,000 shares in total and bought none.

That's according to a new report from Bloomberg, detailing a recent drop in stock value of the company compared to its closest rival Capcom, though stock over the past couple of years has fluctuated but appears relatively stable. It's claimed this recent drop is due to underwhelming sales of Final Fantasy 16, though it also follows the disappointing Forspoken and a number of smaller games released at the tail-end of last year that failed to make much of an impression.


Bloomberg sources include current and former Square Enix employees who remain anonymous, but stated the company's approach is to give each project a single producer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to feel old? Yesterday Steam turned 20. Sorry.


To celebrate this huge milestone, Steam has launched a new anniversary page detailing major games and events from the past 20 years. There are some big discounts too.


"Valve launched Steam on September 12, 2003, and we're super proud and incredibly grateful for what we've been able to do in the 20 years since," reads the page. "Steam's success is a direct result of the players and developers around the world who use it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yesterday's news that Unity will begin charging per game install, indie developers have taken to social media to make their fury heard.


Unity shared a blog post detailing plans of a new business model where a monthly fee per new game install will be set from 1st January next year. In a statement following the blog post, the game engine creator insisted the change will "only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users".


However, a huge number of games are built using Unity tools, so the reaction to this change has been met with widespread criticism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game development engine Unity has U-turned on some parts of its hugely controversial plan to enforce fees on game creators every time someone downloads their work, following widespread backlash. 


Unity told Axios last night it had "regrouped" to further discuss some of the issues raised by game developers, and made some concessions.


Initially, Unity planned to charge game developers a small fee every time a user installed a Unity game (beginning at the start of 2024, subject to the project meeting certain thresholds). Now, Unity said, this charge would only come after a user first installed a game.

Belle will be accompanied by her furry boyfriend Beast, and both will be introduced though a new Realm adventure set in the Beast's castle, with new Friendship Quests and items becoming available once the pair move village-ward.


Additionally, players who've been progressing through Dreamlight Valley's overarching story will be able to settle The Forgotten into the Valley over a series of quests, and - good news for the completionists out their (hello, it's me) - the spooky candy event is back from 24th October to 1st November, meaning you can tidy up any seasonal Dreamlight Duties you missed last year.

Kubernetes v1.25 introduced support for user namespaces for only stateless

done in 1.27.
The beauty of this feature is that:
it is trivial to adopt (you just need to set a bool in the pod spec)

improves security by drastically enhancing the isolation of containers and
mitigating CVEs rated HIGH and CRITICAL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has launched another of its Behind the Sims showcases at the internet, this one bringing confirmation that The Sims 5 - or codename Project Rene as it's officially known at present - will indeed be a free-to-play game, as previously leaked, and will coexist alongside The Sims 4. Oh, and there was also some news on The Sims 4's first Stuff Pack in over two-and-a-half years.


First, though, Project Rene and the news it'll definitely be free-to-play - or as EA is more insistently phrasing it, "free-to-download". Either way, the important thing here is that no core game purchase will be required, and EA is also keen to add there'll be no subscription and no "energy mechanics" - so that's at least one predatory mobile monetisation tactic off the table.


As to what a new mainline Sims game designed from the ground-up to be free-to-play might look like, a Project Rene job listing hastily removed from EA's website earlier this year pointed to an in-game marketplace featuring official and user-generated content (both free and paid) - something else EA has now more or less confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has revealed its new iPhone 15 line-up, bringing the news that its ray-tracing-enabled iPhone 15 Pro will be getting native versions of some AAA titles - including Capcom's Resident Evil 4 Remake and Ubisoft's upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage - over the next 12 months.


The newly unveiled iPhone 15 starts at £799 with 128GB storage, and features a 6.1" Super Retina XDR display (bumped up to 6.7" if you opt for the £899 "Plus" model), an aluminium body, the A16 Bionic Chip with 5-core GPU, and a 4x optical dual camera system capable of taking photos at up to 48MP. It'll also ditch Apple's proprietary Lighting port in favour of USB-C to comply with upcoming EU regulations. 


The pricier iPhone 15 Pro model (starting at £999 with 128GB storage) is where things get a little more interesting for gaming. Its specs are broadly similar to the standard model (the £1,199 Pro Max even has the 6.7" screen), but it switches in a 10x optical "telephoto" camera zoom, titanium body, and the A17 Pro chip with 6-core GPU.

        <updated>2023-09-12T17:47:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model which will see it introduce a monthly fee per new game install beginning on 1st January next year - a move that has drawn considerable criticism from the development community.


Unity - the engine behind countless acclaimed games including Tunic, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Citizen Sleeper, RimWorld, Outer Wilds, Fall Guys, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Cities: Skylines - was previously licenced to developers using a royalty free model built around subscription tiers. Anyone whose revenue or funding was less than $100k over the course of the year (and who didn't want access to features such as the ability to remove the Unity splash screen) could stick to the free Unity Personal licence, while a Unity Plus subscription was required up to $200k in revenue, and a Unity Pro or above subscription was needed for more.


As of 1st January, 2024, however, developers will be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install - seemingly including re-installs and installs across multiple devices - on top of their existing licence subscription, with those fees kicking in for titles that have made $200k or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200k lifetime game installs. Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers, meanwhile, will see the fees applied after passing the $1m revenue and 1m lifetime installs threshold.

Whilst the front shell is a deep purple, the back is white (similar to the design of Velocity Green which was released earlier this year). 
This is your standard Xbox controller, and has all the features you'd expect including textured bumpers and triggers, a dedicated Share button, and 3.5mm jack.

However, a backlash from PC players has resulted in an influx of negative reviews. Now, according to Steam 250, it ranks just behind Overwatch 2 in the list of worst reviewed games on Steam.

More information on what fans can expect is "coming soon", as stated in the announcements from The Pokémon Company, though the teaser video for the event has some glimpses of what we might see. 
Pikachu and Eevee are shown running through a field of sunflowers, against a backdrop of countryside and windmills, before the animation transforms into the art style of an oil painting with Vincent Van Gogh's signature brush strokes. Pikachu and Eevee turn to see the sunflowers have all turned into beaming Sunflora, and then we get a quick look at Van Gogh's famous Sunflowers painting but with Sunflora taking centre stage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its release, Baldur's Gate 3 has gained praise for its execution of D&D systems and the freedom allowed to players in roleplaying. And, like a reluctant DM, the game will warn you if you're about to do something very silly, before watching you do the very silly thing and then say "I warned you".
In Act 3, there are some important items required for the main storyline. You're not supposed to get rid of these and there are some restrictions in place to prevent players from losing one of them, but as BOB_BestOfBugs on YouTube has discovered, that won't stop a resourceful D&D player. 
Warning: This article contains story spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3, so turn back now to avoid those. Perhaps you'd prefer to read our combat tips guide or check out Digital Foundry's impressions of the game on PS5 instead!

The Kubernetes development cycle is an evolving landscape with a myriad of tools seeking to streamline the process. Each tool has its unique approach, and the choice often comes down to individual project requirements, the team's expertise, and the preferred workflow.
Among the various solutions, a category we dubbed “Local K8S Development tools” has emerged, which seeks to enhance the Kubernetes development experience by connecting locally running components to the Kubernetes cluster. This facilitates rapid testing of new code in cloud conditions, circumventing the traditional cycle of Dockerization, CI, and deployment.
In this post, we compare three solutions in this category: Telepresence, Gefyra, and our own contender, mirrord.

XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division initially announced as Tom Clancy's XDefiant back in 2021 before dropping its prefix - has had a number of closed Insider tests and open sessions throughout its development and was expected to get its full launch for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC some time this summer.


However, writing in a post on Ubisoft's website, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin explained the game's continuing lack of a release date can largely be blamed on complication arising during Microsoft and Sony's certification processes for their respective consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last time you got up from playing Xbox in your Xbox-branded onesie to grab yourself some food made with your Xbox-branded cookbook from your Xbox-branded mini-fridge, did you by any chance say to yourself, "Gee, I really wish I'd been able to buy all this Xbox tat with an Xbox-branded credit card"? Well, guess what? Anything is possible in this darkest of timelines.


The official Xbox credit card will soon be a thing, albeit only in the US for the time being, having been conjured into existence through a partnership between Microsoft and Mastercard. It'll initially be available exclusively to Xbox Insiders (it's expected to expand to all US-based Xbox players starting next year) and offers one of those reward-based scheme things, which - and I'm not sure there's a nicer way of putting this - essentially incentivises people to increase their debt, so, you know, please use responsibly and all that.


Basically, everyday purchases made on the card will steadily accrue points that can be spent on games and add-ons via Xbox.com, but an initial purchase using the card will also reward cardholders with 5,000 points (equating to $50 USD), plus three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Only new members are eligible for that three-month deal, incidentally, but it can be gifted to other people if you're already a Game Pass subscriber yourself.

"The base case is that Gearbox remains a part of Embracer," Gearbox chief communications officer Dan Hewitt told staff in an email seen by Bloomberg. "However, there are many options under consideration, including Gearbox's transfer, taking Gearbox independent, and others. Ultimately, we'll move ahead with whichever path is best for both Gearbox and Embracer."


"Nothing has been decided yet," Hewitt added, "but there will be a lot of speculation in the coming weeks."

Sony announced a limited edition bundle for the upcoming Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which includes a custom PS5 cover. The cover features black tendrils on a red background to represent the battle between Venom and Spider-Man, complete with a white spidey logo in the corner.

Dbrand's version is aptly called Arachnoplates and is a close copy of Sony's design, albeit with more intricate webbing in the design and no spiders in sight.

Corden made the claim in the latest edition of his podcast, The Xbox Two Podcast, in a broader conversation about the pros of established studios sticking to the development blueprint that made their games so special versus the cons of taking risks and innovating, only for it to instantly crash and burn.

YouTuber Maka91Productions has released a full guide about their clever way to maximise your XP. Admittedly, you won't be able to get to it immediately – you'll need some skill points and the Outpost Engineering skill to set it up, as well as be pretty comfortable with the game's mechanics – but once you've a few hours under your belt, make sure you research power generation and resource extractors at a Research Laboratory.

How you configure your ship is just as important, too. As The Loadout notes, you should ensure your ship can carry 2000-3000 cargo space, and then make a beeline for these resources: Adaptive Frames (18), Aluminum (124), 2Beryllium (24), Copper (30), Fiber (2), Iron (99), and Tungsten (24) from Jemison Mercantile and the store on ship.

"Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition" popped up on the IMDA's website, having been approved for a "M18" – that's a mature 18 – given its "sexual references". The bundle includes both the base game and its expansion, Burning Shores.

"Set on post-apocalyptic Earth, the protagonist, Aloy, travels to the west to discover the source of a mysterious signal and to find a way to restore Earth," the extended classification information explains (thanks, TryHard).

Whilst Vincke has been incredibly taciturn about the possibility of additional Baldur's Gate 3 content - not least because Larian is currently occupied developing another title as well as managing Baldur Gate's 3 post-launch activities and console ports – he did acknowledge that he'd been thinking about how DLC could complement Baldur's Gate 3, going so far as to hint that it didn't even have to be constrained to an "end-game" event. 

In an interview with Dungeons & Dragons' Todd Kenreck (embedded below), Vincke said that the idea of appending DLC could be "very hard" for the team, but conceded that it was "not undoable".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia, the acclaimed survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is shaking off the shackles of Epic Games Store exclusivity and coming to Steam this October - and ahead of its launch, a 40-minute demo is now available on Valve's platform.


Saturnalia - which Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin called a "horrible nightmare in all the right ways" in his Recommended review last year - whisks players away to the ancient, ever-shifting village of Gravoi, for an adventure heavily inspired by Sardinia folklore.


The goal here is to solve the mystery of the village and escape its confines, exploring and avoiding its horrors along the way. To aid in that atttempt, players can switch between four different characters at will, but should all of them die, the town will reassert itself, reconfiguring its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game creation platform Roblox will belatedly launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5 in October. 


The hugely-popular title arrived for Xbox in 2015, following earlier releases on PC, iPhone and Android. A PlayStation launch has taken far longer to materialise, however, reportedly due to concerns from Sony's Jim Ryan around the game's popularity with children.


Comments made by Ryan in 2022 - surfaced this year as part of the FTC vs Microsoft trial - stated that PlayStation had historically been cautious around Roblox due to its millions of young users and "anything that could potentially exploit them". However, Ryan also signalled a thawing of the company's attitude to the game, noting that he had a "hope" the situation would change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Underground Blossom, the latest instalment in developer Rusty Lake's surreal puzzle saga, has a release date: it'll be careening through the tunnels of time and rolling into a distinctly Steam-shaped station on Wednesday, 27th September.


The Rusty Lake games, if you're unfamiliar, meld casual point-and-click puzzling with room-escape-style conundrums to tell a deliciously weird, loosely interconnected tale orbiting (to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the title) the lives of the Vanderboom family. The series generally falls into two camps; shorter, free-to-play offerings under the Cube Escape banner, and longer premium offerings that tend to be more substantial and more creatively ambitious.


Underground Blossom - which follows last year's wonderfully inventive co-operative puzzler The Past Within - falls into the latter camp, this time taking players on a journey, via the Rusty Lake underground system, through the life and memories of Laura Vanderboom, who was introduced all the way back in the series' first outing, Cube Escape: Seasons.

At the start of the week, the Hero Pass was added to the MMORPG, which Jagex previously described as an "always-on reward system". However, the reaction from players was overwhelmingly negative, in particular for pay-to-win options like purchasing Underworld Emblems or levels in the Hero Pass. This is in addition to other changes around content buffs and the Daily Challenge system.



Jagex yesterday released an update promising change. However the severity of player feedback meant the developer has now swiftly released another update, admitting: "We messed up".

So, as it is Friday, here is a little collection of amusing ways Starfield has star-failed, to put a smile on your face ahead of the weekend.

Touch down on one of Starfield's many planets and there are miles of planet to explore in each direction. But you'll be doing this on foot, aided by your trusty jetpack. You can't slide into a waiting dune buggy or landspeeder and jet across the Jundland Wastes, Luke Skywalker style.


This is by design, Bethesda's Todd Howard has said, as it makes for a more authored experience.

The suggestion is that a Bethesda game has never hit six million players in so quick a timeframe. On the one hand, it has done so with the help of Xbox Game Pass. On the other, it has done so without the PlayStation audience.

But for those that do, and that hold the game (and indeed the cartoon it was based on) in high regard, Disney has confirmed its previously announced remaster will be coming to PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on 19th October.


Of course, if you're not someone with fond memories for Gargoyles, that might be because it only ever officially released in North America, slapping onto the Sega Genesis (AKA the Mega Drive everywhere else) around the middle of the cartoon's run. Wikipedia also tells me the well-received game was originally planned to release on Super Nintendo, before getting the chop.


Anyway, 28 years later, Gargoyles the game is returning in the form of Gargoyles Remastered, by Empty Clip Studios, featuring the ability to toggle between the original's wonderfully characterful 16-bit visuals and a new art style said to be inspired by the cartoon, but which, to my eyes at least, doesn't look to have anywhere near the same kind of charm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 is gearing up to be a bit of a celebrity fest - what with the likes of JK Simmons, John Cena, and Megan Fox all putting in an appearance - but perhaps its most perfect addition is 80s action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, cameoing as Johnny Cage, whose in-game likeness has now debuted online courtesy of series co-creator Ed Boon and a bunch of chicken wings.


Boon, in an interesting marketing nuzzle-up, has appeared in the latest episode of First We Feast's Hot Ones, in which famous folk attempt to gorge themselves on chicken wings dipped in an increasingly fiery selection of hot sauces without the tops of their heads flying off.


Boon's 14-minute appearance includes (alongside some sweating and surprised mouth sounds) some breezy chatter about Mortal Kombat 1 and the history of the series, interspersed with bits of gameplay footage. Some of that takes the form of a brief - and by brief I mean barely five-seconds-long - in-game look at Van Damme, who appears around the 5:52 mark. To summarise, he pumps the air, flips the bird, and looks reasonably like a young Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Well, we can now sling those reports onto the 'correct' pile; testing for the tech giant new feature is officially underway.


The gist of Google's new initiative, known as Playables, is that it'll enable users to instantly play online games via YouTube's website or iOS and Android apps - and now, as confirmed on its YouTube test features and experiments list (thanks 9to5google) testing is now live.


"Playables are games that can be played directly on YouTube on both desktop and mobile devices," the company explains. "If you're part of this experiment, you'll see a section on YouTube called 'Playables' that will appear alongside other content on the home feed."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss today's report by Eurogamer that Nintendo is showing Switch 2 tech demos to developers, including at Gamescom last month. The new hardware from the Big N now feels closer than ever - but when exactly will it arrive?

More importantly, perhaps - for any Nintendo console - is what Nintendo game will it launch alongside? Will Switch 2's beefier specs be a smart time to finally launch Metroid Prime 4? Or does Nintendo go with the more mass market approach, and tap up its 3D Mario team? 
Finally, since it's out and it's probably going to be the biggest game of the year, we discuss the opening moments of Starfield - beyond the hour we all spend in the character creator. Joining me this week to share their thoughts on all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

Last month, Nintendo announced that Martinet, the exuberant voice of Mario, will no longer be the English voice actor behind Nintendo's most recognisable mascot, after almost 30 years in the job. Instead, new voice talent will take over this role, starting with the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder later this year. Martinet, meanwhile, was announced to be starting a new position as a Mario Ambassador. 


Now, in a new video message, both Miyamoto and Martinet have shared more on this new role.

The ESA has also informed the Los Angeles Convention Centre, E3's long-held home, it will not turn up there in 2024 - following an earlier report which stated the LA City Tourism Department did not expect the show to run there for the forseeable future.

Last night, NetherRealm announced Nitara will return to the series as a playable character for the first time in almost 20 years. In a new video showcasing the blood-thirsty fighter, Fox said the character resonated with her, perhaps acknowledging her own penchant for a few drops of the red stuff. 


Nitara is "evil but also good," Fox explained in the video, adding that she is "trying to save her people". Fox said she had a lot of fun bringing her talents to Mortal Kombat 1, calling the series a "staple" on the gaming landscape. "We did all grow up playing the game... it is one of the greatest video games of all time".

Developer presentations for Switch 2 took place behind closed doors, Eurogamer understands, with partners shown tech demos of how well the system is designed to run. 

One Switch 2 demo is a souped up version of Switch launch title Zelda: Breath of the Wild, designed to hit the Switch 2's beefier target specs. (To be clear, though - this is just a tech demo. There's no suggestion the game will be re-released.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 is far from a difficult game. There's no time limit you need to worry about, most resources can be perpetually collected, and the game is extremely forgiving about your ever-growing Pikmin death toll.


It's easy enough to see Pikmin 4's story properly to the end, with the toughest challenges being its platinum badges for Dandori side-missions. (It can be particularly tough with some of the Dandori battles against the AI, and especially tricky in that one, very long cave.


Tom is going through and collecting all of the platinum badges, to which I say godspeed, but ever since I finished Pikmin 4 I've been thinking about other ways I could challenge myself in the game. At time of writing, the speedrunning record for getting Pikmin 4's true ending is just under two and a half hours, but it doesn't take advantage of any area skips - it's an exercise in Dandori mastery because there aren't really any major glitches to take advantage of to begin with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve's never-ending tinkering with Steam will soon see support for PlayStation's DualSense and DualShock controllers bought to the fore, their compatibility set to be clearly listed on store and library pages starting this October.


That's according to a developer-focused blog post revealing, among other things, that of the 87m Steam users who've played a game using a controller at least once, around 27 percent of those - up from 11 percent in 2018 - 
utilise either PS4's DualShock or PS5's DualSense.


To cater for these users, developers are now being asked to complete a questionnaire that'll automatically rate a game's DualShock/Sense compatibility based on the answers given.  Players can expect the results of these questions to clearly manifest as store-page guidance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All eyes might currently be on BigOl'Spacegame, but there's plenty more happening behind-the-scenes at Bethesda, one of those things obviously being MachineGames' Indiana Jones project - which, depending how you choose to interpret four words from Bethesda's Todd Howard, might just be gearing up for a proper reveal next year.


Bethesda announced it had an Indiana Jones game in the works - with Wolfenstein studio MachineGames at the helm - all the way back in January 2021, warning, "It'll be some time before we have more to reveal." And, true to its word, the project has remained shrouded in secrecy since - although we do at least now have confirmation, thanks to an FTC hearing testimony from Bethesda's Pete Hines, that it'll be releasing exclusively on Xbox and PC.


So with Bethesda's Indy announcement steadily approaching its third anniversary, a persistent question has been, "When will we see more?", and Todd Howard has now maybe teased - in an interview with Esquire - that the project will be getting a proper reveal sometime next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Gunfire Games has confirmed it's readying a new update for its celebrated (and million-selling) Souls-like shooter sequel Remnant 2, promising that more quality of life updates, bug fixes, performance improvements, and a "potato mode" will be with players "soon".


That news comes via Remnant 2 principal designer Ben Cureton, who shared a list of the upcoming patch's headline features on social media. The aforementioned "potato mode" is, alas, unlikely to fulfil all your wildest, possibily erotic potato-slaying fantasies, more likely being some under-the-hood changes Gunfire has made to push Remnant 2's settings below those previously allowed - hopefully meaning improved performance on lower-spec PCs.


Performance improvements have, of course, been a focus for Gunfire following Remnant 2's slightly wobbly launch, and Cureton's post makes it explicitly clear the incoming patch will include more. That comes alongside the introduction of toggle aim and hold sprint, "dozens" of enemy updates, material refund changes for weapon deconstruction, PlayStation icon selection, and proper EXP rewards for instances where Summons make the kills.

Each new expansion of Square Enix's MMORPG has extended its meme-worthy free trial to include more and more of the game. As announced recently at the Las Vegas Fan Fest, that free trial will be expanded to include Stormblood up to level 70 when next expansion Dawntrail is released next year.



But will the company ever reach a point where that free trial is extended to the full game? Director Naoki Yoshida told Eurogamer it won't, though the free trial will likely be expanded further.

The Sims 4's Poolside Splash Kit, obviously enough, is all about appropriate attire for those lazy afternoons spent lounging with a margarita in one hand and a 700-page tome about the history of biscuits in the other (or, you know, whatever). That means the likes of shorts, trunks, vests, sandals, and bathing suits, sporting, as EA puts it, a "plethora of patterns, colors and trendy cuts" designed to compliment a variety of skin tones and body shapes.


Finishing touches come in the form of various aquatic accessories, including sunglasses, sandals, rainbow nails, floaties (including at least one rubber ring), and more.

Eurogamer spoke to the ex-Bethesda producer at Gamescom and discussed the current state of RPGs: why they're so popular and how the success of Larian's latest game was raising expectations of the genre.


"I am thrilled, not threatened by great RPGs," said Gardiner, when asked about Baldur's Gate 3. "I love playing them. I would never be upset by this. I think it brings more people into the fanbase of RPGs. As an RPG creator and player I really believe in RPGs - I always have since I started playing them when I was a kid until now... I will celebrate their success, I'll be their biggest fans forever. I am absolutely thrilled by it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having sex in Starfield will give you an XP boost.


For those looking to increase their XP, it looks like it would be worth setting yourself up for a romantic experience. 


As highlighted on the Starfield reddit (via VG247), players will get a 15 percent XP boost when they sleep with a companion. This little buff is called "Emotional Security", and lasts for 24 minutes. It is similar but better than the 10 percent well-rested condition, which you can get by sleeping without a companion by your side.

On 29th September, players will take on the role of a brand-new Bond in Cypher 007. This top-down mobile title comes from Tilting Point, and promises a return to some classic Bond locations, as well as the chance to relive some of the series' "iconic moments" from the past 60 years. 


This will, of course, mean Her Majesty's best agent will also come face to face with several of his known-nemesis, such as Blofeld - along with Spectre - and Jaws. And, as every Bond fan knows, this means gadgets galore, including Little Nellie, Bond's gyrocopter from You Only Live Twice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross-play is apparently already on the development roadmap for Baldur's Gate 3. This means players on PlayStation 5 and PC - and at some point, Xbox - will all theoretically be able to play together online in the future.
Confirmation comes from Larian's director of publishing, Michael Douse, who told me the studio always intended to do cross-play but it was one thing too many to get working for launch. The PS5 version comes out today, remember; the PC version came out at the beginning of August; and the Xbox versions will arrive at some point this year.
"It was always in the planning," Douse told me, "but we knew it wouldn't be for launch. It's in the roadmap, and though we have an idea of when we'd like to get it ready for, we don't want to put a date on it until we're sure."

Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujibayashi agreed, and said that while he was already thinking about what the "next fun experience" for the Zelda series should be, he did not know yet what form this may take.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More Baldur's Gate 3 fixes have spilled forth from the depths of developer Larian Studios' ceaseless patch factory, this latest update - officially known as Hotfix #5 - remedying some previously acknowledged Minthara progression issues, as well as bringing a number of improvements specifically targeting the newly released PlayStation 5 version.


Starting with Minthara, Hotfix #5 aims to address some behind-the-scenes weirdness that was blocking certain lines of her dialogue, as well preventing player romances with the character from progressing in Act 3. There'd been some concern in the community, you might recall, that Minthara had been a victim of last-minute content cuts to meet Baldur's Gate 3's shifted deadline - but Larian had instead blamed her silence on a bug, promising an imminent fix, which, now here, should hopefully reinstate all missing Minthara content.


"This hotfix takes care of a bug that blocked access to some of Minthara’s lines of dialogue, including some hot takes from your companions about your decision to date the ruthless Oath of Vengeance Paladin," Larian explains in today's release notes. "If approval is high enough, your romance with Minthara will progress in Act 3. This unlocks several new dialogues allowing you to explore and deepen the relationship, and discover more details of Minthara's backstory. Alongside many lines of interactive dialogue, many more non-interactive voiced lines are available with Minthara as a romantic partner."

Xbox voice reporting, meanwhile - another feature that made headlines on its Xbox Insiders debut - enables players to easily capture a 60-second video clip of an in-game voice incident they believe violates Xbox Community Standards then submit it as evidence for review.

News of Stray's animated adaptation comes via Entertainment Weekly, and while specifics are limited at this seemingly early juncture, there's a least a of hint at what Annapurna Animation will be trying to achieve in its own "respectful" adaptation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Payday 3's  closed beta in August, developer Starbreeze has announced a three-day "technical open beta" for its co-op heist shooter  - running from this Friday, 8th September to Monday's 11th September - ahead of this month's full launch.


The goal, once again, is to stress test Payday 3's servers ready for its 21st September arrival on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, only this time Starbreeze is throwing open the doors to anyone that fancies getting stuck in - as long as they're on Xbox Series X/S or Steam.


As for what'll be available this time around, it's very much the same story as before; the Payday series' clown-masked original quartet - Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf - will all be playable, as will be the No Rest for the Wicked bank heist, which can be tackled either stealthily or guns a-blazing, depending on your own particular whims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wondered why, when you're having a lovely stroll around the world of Baldur's Gate 3, there are so many bodies without heads lying around? No it's not because the inhabitants of the world have faulty necks - it's because developer Larian is doing something sneaky.
You see, offering people the ability to speak with any corpse via the spell Speak with Dead created a lot of work. It meant writers not only had to write lines for all the living people, but for the dead ones too. And okay, there's a limiting factor in how Speak with Dead only allows you to ask five questions, but that's still an array of questions to write answers for. And in a war-torn world filled with dead people... That's a lot of answers to write.
What to do? Simple, albeit gruesome: cut their heads off. "The trick that we use is [you can speak to] 'any dead that still has their head'," Vincke told Wizards of the Coast interviewer Todd Kenreck, in a really lovely interview actually. "So you will see a lot of decapitated people in the game - that's literally how we solved that."

There are a variety of suits in Starfield, obtained in various ways. Some you can buy from vendors, others can be found by exploration and looting. Your usual video game fare. However, if you are canny and take the time to place your cursor in just the right place, you can nab one of Starfield's better suits as early as the second mission. 


The suit in question is the Mark 1 Spacesuit, which comes with the accompanying Helmet and Pack. It is all kept in a glass cabinet, under lock and key, in the basement of The Lodge. You can try to unlock this case in the traditional way, but unless you are a Master lock picker, you will be informed it is too difficult to do this right now.

Patch notes state players should now see a smoother performance when in this mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, over on PC, this Jedi: Survivor patch has introduced support for Nvidia DLSS, which the team said can "massively improve performance" for some users.


The patch also includes the usual bug fixes, such as fixing an issue where players could not retrieve XP if they died under a specific set of circumstances.

Molyneux has become known for describing his games in interviews only for the end product to not live up to those words, something which he has repeatedly apologised for in the past, describing his behaviour as over-excitement and lies to stop bored journalists falling asleep. 

In the latest episode of the podcast My Perfect Console with Simon Parkin, Molyenux said the games he described in interviews were the product of a "half-insane, creative mind" designing games on the fly whilst trying to show passion for his work.

Developer Pieces Interactive said it is "gracefully" stepping away from the "chaotic" October release window, to "avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man".

The developer continued: "Horror games thrive on the delicate balance of tension, exploiting our vulnerability and the eerie embrace of solitude. Envision yourself traversing a dimly lit house in the dead of night, where faint whispers and unidentifiable noises send shivers down your spine.

<blockquote><p>Shedding Light on CVSS Scoring Inconsistencies: A User-Centric Study on Evaluating Widespread Security Vulnerabilities</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a popular method for evaluating the severity of vulnerabilities in vulnerability management. In the evaluation process, a numeric score between 0 and 10 is calculated, 10 being the most severe (critical) value. The goal of CVSS is to provide comparable scores across different evaluators. However, previous works indicate that CVSS might not reach this goal: If a vulnerability is evaluated by several analysts, their scores often differ. This raises the following questions: Are CVSS evaluations consistent? Which factors influence CVSS assessments? We systematically investigate these questions in an online survey with 196 CVSS users. We show that specific CVSS metrics are inconsistently evaluated for widespread vulnerability types, including Top 3 vulnerabilities from the &#8221;2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses&#8221; list. In a follow-up survey with 59 participants, we found that for the same vulnerabilities from the main study, 68% of these users gave different severity ratings. Our study reveals that most evaluators are aware of the problematic aspects of CVSS, but they still see CVSS as a useful tool for vulnerability assessment. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for inconsistent evaluations and provide recommendations on improving the consistency of scoring...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Nintendo said this new position will see the actor continuing to "travel the world sharing the joy of Mario and interacting with you all!" Other than that, it did not go into specifics on the job's actual requirements.

Ratatan, if you're unaware, is a collaboration between Ratata Arts, Tokyo Virtual Theory, and pH Studio, with Patapon creator Hiroyuki Kotani at the helm and original Patapon musician Kemmei Adach also returning. It's described as roguelike blend of rhythm and side-scroller action in which players, either battling alone or with friends, build an army of 100 Cobun to take on foes as their march across the world of Redo continues.


Its crowdfunding campaign launched onto Kickstarter on 31st July, with the goal of raising ¥20,000,000 (approximately £109,000), but a little over a month later, it's now wrapped up with ¥219,314,335 (around £1.2m) in the bank after contributions from 14,598 backers - apparently making it the  36th most funded video game Kickstarter of all time.

Along with the game's thorough character creator, which has already birthed the likes of Walter White from Breaking Bad and Tony Soprano, people have also been flexing their creative muscles on the ship front. 


Starting with perhaps one of the most famous sci-fi properties, here we have a selection of Star Wars-inspired ships. Of course, Han Solo's Millennium Falcon has popped up several times since Starfield's early access release.

Most obviously, if we follow the timeline setout by the developer, humans will be able to gallivant around in space and planet hop as casually as popping across The Channel for a quick visit to France. In fact, possibly even more casually than that. 


But, one thing that also apparently changes between now and 2330, is that dogs seem to go extinct. Or at least, labrador retrievers certainly do.


As shared by the prolific Can You Pet The Dog? social media account, it appears that man's best friend is a thing of the past for those members of Constellation.

Last week, fans spotted a note on Nintendo's Japanese website which stated that you could pick between different options for the flowers' voice and speech bubbles, raising the possibility you could ignore them completely.

The Sinistcha "pretends to be tea, trying to fool people into drinking it so it can drain their life-force" – although the ruse is "generally unsuccessful" – and is thought to be from the same line as Poltchageist, as it looks like a Poltchageist, albeit with a different container.

"Today, we permanently banned 90,000 smurf accounts that have been active over the last few months," the team explained (thanks, PC Gamer).

<blockquote><p>The transparent squid is a genetically altered version of the <a href="https://www.mbl.edu/research/research-organisms/hummingbird-bobtail-squid">hummingbird bobtail squid</a>, a species usually found in the tropical waters from Indonesia to China and Japan.

<p>The see-through version is made possible by a gene editing technology called <a>CRISPR</a>, which became popular nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>Albertin and Rosenthal thought they might be able to use CRISPR to create a special squid for research. They focused on the hummingbird bobtail squid because it is small, a prodigious breeder, and thrives in lab aquariums, including one at the lab in Woods Hole...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive's medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is celebrating its three-year anniversary by trumpeting 3m copies sold since launch and by releasing a bunch of statistics gleaned in that time, suggesting players' conflict resolution skills may need some work - or at least, a little less of a preoccupation with murder.


According to Paradox, a grand total of 50,159,539 murder schemes have been successfully carried out since Crusader Kings 3's arrival back in 2020. That's nearly 16m more murder plots than wedding celebrations, which currently sit at 34,480,042. And, of course, more than a few chaotic sorts have thoroughly muddied the waters between the two, with Paradox reporting a total of 7,790 bloody weddings have been msaterminded by players who cleary weren't going to let a bit of murder get in the way of anyone's big day - or possiby vice versa.


Paradox's other shared stats don't open up quite such a fascinating window on player behaviour, but we do know 1,325,198 grand tournaments have been bravely fought since launch, and 1,037,787 grand weddings have also been held. In total, player have amassed more than 317m hours in-game, with nearly 1.4m players having joined this year alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gunbrella, the 2D platform-shooter from developer Doinksoft and publisher Devolver Digital that very much lives up to its title, finally has a release date and will be unfurling onto Switch and PC with a dramatic fwap on 13th September.


Doinksoft's "gritty noir-punk action-adventure" follows the adventures of a gruff woodsman armed with the high-calibre brolly of the title as he embarks on a request for revenge. Soon, because this is very much one of those games, players become embroiled in a conspiracy involving ghouls, gangsters, cops, cultists, and, of course, a corporation run amok.


In more practical terms, that manifests as a side-scrolling action-platformer in which players take on the might of their foes using a brolly that's simultaneously a gun - enhanceable with munitions and upgrades fashioned from gathered scrap - plus a handy all-in-one shield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of last week's splendid Echoes update, No Man's Sky has now launched its latest limited-time expedition, Voyagers, giving players approximately six weeks to complete its objectives and secure some very nifty rewards - including an adorable HoverDroid companion, looking very much like a flying Roomba with eyes.


Voyagers - which, like all previous expeditions, starts players afresh on a completely new save - begins aboard a freighter in No Man's Sky's Oishida system, where Travelers will embark on a journey to complete exploration-focused objectives, discovering new creatures, braving extreme planets, digging up ancient treasures, and more along the way.


If you're new to all this, expeditions are something like No Man's Sky's stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. Completing all objectives within a tier unlocks a new reward exclusive to the expedition and completing all tiers awards one final prize.

Today, the jet-loving team announced the Back to the Future collaboration for its beloved clean-it-up game (which is a bit of a Eurogamer favourite). FuturLab has said this DLC pack, which will retail at £6.49/$7.99/€7.99, will be a faithful homage to Marty and Doc's time travelling escapades. 


So, what can you expect to clean on this DLC's release? Well, of course, you will have to get your watery-jets into every nook and cranny of the series' Time Machine. It really wouldn't be a Back to the Future collaboration without it. Additionally, Doc's van, Hill Valley Clock Tower, the Holomax Theatre and Doc's Time Train will all need to be sprayed to perfection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NES released in Japan 40 years ago, but a new Rugrats game is on the way to Nintendo's old console next year.


Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland is a classic mascot platformer based on the 90s Nickelodeon TV series coming to PC, consoles, and the NES.


The game is presented in retro 8-bit graphics, though modern versions will also include a HD graphics option to toggle on a smooth hand-drawn look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield has only been out in early access for a matter of hours, but fans are already taking matters into their own hands to alter the game's FOV.


While Bethesda may yet provide an official option in future, there's no way currently to alter Starfield's FOV for yourself within the game. 


But, already, there are a number of downloads available on NexusMods for players to tinker with the FOV, via a new text file added to the game's folder on your PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield may be Microsoft's big Xbox console exclusive for the year, but it's already off to an impressive start on Steam.


The game released overnight for those who purchase its pricey £85.99 premium edition, which allows access ahead of the release on 6th September.


Already, Starfield has reached a peak of 234,502 concurrent players, according to SteamDB. At the time of writing it's the sixth most played game on the platform, behind only heavy hitters like CS:GO, Dota 2, and Baldur's Gate 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Bethesda described Starfield as having a "NASA-Punk" aesthetic. This term was coined by the development team to describe "a sci-fi universe that's a little more grounded and relatable". Essentially, Bethesda wants its game to have a sense of realism meets grit, and it is doing this by combining the practicality of real-life space technology with the aesthetics of Punk culture. 


Now, this design decision has got the European Space Agency's approval, with its head of branding and partnerships Emmet Fletcher telling me he believes Starfield's NASA-Punk aesthetic "humanises" the game.


"This is the aesthetic where you basically have worn and loved futuretech? Actually, if you look at some of the things we have, it's a little bit like that already," he told me from his office in Paris earlier this week. "We have things that if it works, it carries on working. And there's no need to change it. It's about reliability, and if it's reliable, it carries on."

On August 15, 2023, the Kubernetes project announced the general availability of

at pkgs.k8s.io. The new package repositories are replacement for the legacy

the future.
Today, we're formally deprecating the legacy package repositories (apt.kubernetes.io

the repositories as of September 13, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearbox's Borderlands series is readying for a busy few months; a six-game digital-only Borderlands bundle is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC tomorrow, 1st September, and Borderlands 3 will be making its Switch debut on 6th October.


Starting with the Borderlands Collection: Pandora's Box, as the bundle is officially known, it packages up every game in the series so far, excluding last year's Tina Tina's Wonderlands spin-off - so, Borderlands 1, 2, The Pre-Sequel, 3, Tales from the Borderlands, and New Tales from the Borderlands - and then crams in every bit of accompanying DLC.


It's a significant amount of Borderlands, then, and the bundle comes with a correspondingly sizeable price tag, weighing in at $149.99 USD (or your local equivalent). The happier news, though, is that publisher 2K is offering a range of discounts, starting with a far more affordable $59.99 limited-time launch price. Additionally, 2K has announced a number of upgrade paths for existing Borderlands players, making the cost of entry more manageable still.

Volition, which celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this year, announced the closure in a statement shared on social media, writing, "This past June, Embracer Group announced a restructuring programme to strengthen and maintain its position as a leader in the video game industry. As part of that programme, they evaluated strategic and operational goals and made the difficult decision to close Volition effective immediately."


The statement adds that Embracer is "working to provide job assistance and help smooth the transition for our Volition family members". The move is likely to effect around 340 people based on the studio's most recently shared employment figures.

We sat down this week to chat about what we saw and ended up honing in on some of our personal favourites - games which may not have caught the headlines as much as that big new RPG everyone's going on about. Games which appealed specifically to us - because they felt authentically British - like the wonderfully Yorkshire Thank Goodness You're Here and the North Sea oil rig horror Still Wakes the Deep. 
I adored The Plucky Squire. Ed loved Black Myth: Wukong. Together with Victoria Kennedy, who held the news fort brilliantly back home in Blighty, we chat about the best of what we saw last week in Cologne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow puzzlers, there is good news. Not only has the second expansion for The Case of the Golden Idol been announced, but it is actually available now. 


Known as The Lemurian Vampire, this expansion connects the game's previous expansion Spider of Lanka directly to the main game. "The only thing that stands in your way, is the mysterious Tower Dweller and its powerful Golden artefact," developer Color Gray Games teased. 


The Lemurian Vampire consists of three new scenarios to mull over, as you "follow the perilous journey of the Lemurian delegation to Monkey Paw Island". These delegates are on the search for the fountain of youth (aren't we all?), and of course any riches that may be hidden along the way.

This new console edition is, as you can see in the header image above, very red. It features a little Mario silhouette tucked away on the back corner of the base, as well as some hidden coins inside its back panel.


This new Switch OLED will be available to scoop up from 6th October. While Nintendo hasn't shared specifics yet, it has said to keep an eye out for more information on pre-orders, and presumably a price, "soon".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon's Prime Gaming offers several free titles throughout the month of September, including Football Manager 2023 and the winemaking sim Hundred Days.


In our Football Manager 2023 review on PC, we described it as "the best sim of its kind", however contributor Phil Iwaniuk felt the "lack of major improvements shows an annual release schedule taking its toll".


As for Hundred Days, our Bertie spoke to Yves Hohler, lead designer of the game, back in 2021, to learn more about how his experiences shaped the winemaking sim. It's a cute and cosy game that never feels bogged down by the management aspect, instead presenting a whimsical love letter to Hohler's earlier life.

<blockquote><p>So how was this van turned into a mobile spying center? Well, let&#8217;s start with how it has more LCD monitors than a Counterstrike LAN party. They can be used to monitor any of six different video inputs including a videoscope camera. A videoscope and a borescope are very similar as they&#8217;re both cameras on the ends of optical fibers, so the same tech you&#8217;d use to inspect cylinder walls is also useful for surveillance. Kind of cool, right? Multiple Sony DVD-based video recorders store footage captured by cameras, audio recorders by high-end equipment brand Marantz capture sounds, and time and date generators sync gathered media up for accurate analysis. Circling back around to audio, this van features seven different audio inputs including a body wire channel...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Well, they take me by surprise - I bet you're much more savvy than me. Just in case you aren't, though, and you're a kindred spirit, here's what I stumbled upon.
The tip that really took me by surprise is this. Did you know that you can initiate combat during an interaction cut-scene to affect the outcome of it? It means you can potentially save a character scripted to be attacked - and maybe killed - during the cut-scene before it actually happens. 
The tip comes from content creator ESO Danny. As the video points out, you can interrupt a cut-scene by selecting the "Attack" circular button/option in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red has said its decision to only develop one expansion for its ambitious sci-fi role-player was based solely on "technological" factors. 


The drama around Cyberpunk 2077's initial launch and subsequent withdrawal from sale on PlayStation, as well as the game's overall sales figures, all had nothing to do with it, the developer has stated. 


"As we have announced a long time ago, we're not going to make a second or third expansion," CD Projekt exec Michał Nowakowski said in an investor Q&A held last night (thanks, VGC). "This is the only expansion of the game, and it has nothing to do with the numbers and how satisfied or not we are with sales or anything of the kind."

Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden - which is due to launch for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 on 7th November - sees Life is Strange and Vampyr developer Don't Nod heading to the frozen wilderness of North America, circa 1695, for a tale of ghost-hunting lovers, one of whom is (rather awkwardly given their profession) recently undead.


It's the pleasingly spooky set-up for an action-RPG that promises a "mystical, lore-rich world plagued with supernatural creatures and ancient secrets", and Banishers' extended gameplay trailer follows our heroes Red and the spirit-y Antea as they investigate a haunting at the behest of a New Eden villager - an investigation that leaps between the physical and spectral worlds, and somehow manages to involve quite a lot of gun.

Call of Duty's new voice chat moderation system will employ AI-powered technology from Modulate to identify and enforce against toxic speech in real-time, with flagged language including hate speech, discrimination, and harassment.


An initial beta for Call of Duty's new voice moderation system is being rolled out across Warzone and Modern Warfare 2 starting today, 30th August, in North America, and a global release will coincide with Modern Warfare 3's arrival in November. Activision notes the tools will only support English at first, with additional languages coming "at a later date".

The game will be published by Humble Games and is being developed by Squid Shock Studios, comprising members of the AM2R team - an unofficial fan remake of Metroid 2.


Bō: Path of The Teal Lotus is, understandably, a Metroidvania, but with a beautiful Japanese art style reminiscent of Okami. Check out the new trailer below.

It's unclear when the remasters will now launch, though a statement from Konami simply reads "as soon as is possible".


"Regarding the planned release of Suikoden 1 and 2 HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, we have reached the conclusion that despite the very best efforts of our dedicated development staff to release the Remasters in 2023, additional time is needed to ensure the quality performance and gameplay experience our users deserve," reads the statement.

It's an impressive number for the indie game from The Messenger developer Sabotage Studio. It's doubly impressive when the game was released simultaneously on both Game Pass and PlayStation Plus - the first game to do so. 


The sales announcement, made on X (formerly Twitter), specifies copies sold rather than the game's overall players, meaning that 100k number reflects Steam and Switch sales.

In an interview with Games Radar at Gamescom, Iizuka discussed the future of the Sonic franchise and the need to maintain both 2D and 3D Sonic games in parallel.


"When we talk about the brand, we definitely need to have a modern Sonic 3D game," he said. "We also feel we need to have a classic Sonic 2D game. Those are our fundamental pillars that we need to have. We're expanding into movies and TV, but we still need to have both the 3D and the 2D line up for our gaming audience."

Patch 2's headline features include Baldur's Gate 3's first "substantial performance improvements" and better closure to its story. Starting with performance, Larian is promising improvements across the entire game, but says "Act 3 [is] where you'll feel it the most".


Specifically, Patch 2 will target the city of Baldur's Gate itself, which Digital Foundry's recently highlighted as a serious rough spot in an otherwise impressive game. Larian, for its part, calls the area "ambitious technically, narratively, and in scope", saying, "One of the biggest issues with creating games is that technology is always trying to keep up with your ambition, and here we've been hit pretty hard by some setbacks."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pioneers of Pagonia, the intriguing new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich and his team at Envision Entertainment, is launching into Steam early access on 13th December, with a public demo and closed alpha planned before then.


Pioneers of Pagonia, for the uninitiated, whisks players away to the procedurally generated islands of Pagonia, where they'll need to establish a presence - steadily increasingly their reach and influence among the islands' many fantastical, not always friendly inhabitants - through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover along the way.


We got a first taste of Pioneers of Pagonia's city building action back in June - via an extremely adorable in-game reveal trailer - and Envision has been sharing occassional gameplay details in posts on Steam too. Soon, though, it'll be time for players to get stuck in, starting with a closed alpha in September - which will be available to selected subscribers of the studio's newsletter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jupiter Corporation - the studio behind Nintendo's long-running Picross series - has unveiled a new Picross-style puzzler, Logiart Grimoire, which launches into Steam early access on 11th September and Switch sometime next year.


The Logiart Grimoire of the title is a magical book formerly used to solve Logiart mysteries before its power waned, and it comes into players' possession along with its custodian, a helpful wizard-y companion called Emil. That whole fanciful framing device is, of course, secondary to the real business at hand: solving 'picture logic puzzles' that feature horizontal and vertical rows of numbers used as hints to place dots on a grid and form illustrations.


If that sounds familiar, it's because Logiart Grimoire is essentially Picross in all but name (Nintendo owns the 'Picross' title, while Jupiter owns its systems), albeit with an added magic twist hooking into a new "fusion" system that challenges players to figure out how to combine materials gained through solving puzzles to unlock new ones.

We are thrilled to announce the v0.8.0 release of Gateway API! With this
release, Gateway API support for service mesh has reached Experimental
status. We look forward to your feedback!
We're especially delighted to announce that Kuma 2.3+, Linkerd 2.14+, and Istio

Service mesh support in Gateway API
While the initial focus of Gateway API was always ingress (north-south)
traffic, it was clear almost from the beginning that the same basic routing
concepts should also be applicable to service mesh (east-west) traffic. In

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't think I've ever been quite so enamoured by a menu screen. Spinning wheels and pressing buttons to make selections. Picking up figurines with my hands to inspect them closely. Looking down at the dusty library below me from my cosy attic - a library Moss fans will certainly be familiar with.


That's the power of virtual reality, something developer Polyarc is particularly adept at harnessing. Moss and its sequel remain two of the best adventures playable in VR; now there's Glassbreakers, a game set in the same world but with totally different gameplay.


Polyarc describes the game as a live service 1v1 real-time battler. In practice, it's you against another player online aiming to take control of a hex board using three champions who auto-battle in real time. You strategically manoeuvre your characters across the board to destroy your opponent's tower. It looks a bit like holochess in Star Wars, but with woodland creatures instead of aliens.

The announcement comes shortly after the release of real-time strategy stealth game Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew two weeks ago. Other games under Mimimi's belt include Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperados 3.

The statement regarding the studio's closure, attributed to co-founders Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth, was posted on Mimimi's website which, at time of writing, returns a 403 error but can be viewed as a cached version via Google.

The design has taken most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her dual pistols, tank top and braid all taking pride of place in the promotional shots released so far (see header above, and image below). 
This version of Lara also wears the necklace from the Tomb Raider reboot games, perhaps giving us a look at how Lara might appear in the series' future, unified timeline. She certainly looks older than the 'Survivor' timeline Lara, who we last saw in 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

Although a core appeal of the game's mechas are the fun guns and lasers you can outfit your robot with, you can still have a great time without them.
This is what YouTuber ZeroLenny set out to prove by beating Armored Core 6 without any weapons - no guns, no rockets, just pure force and punches.

This new trademark, spotted by WellPlayed, covers a range of categories, including "downloadable game software; computer game software downloadable from a global computer network; downloadable computer game software for use on mobile devices",  and more.  


As a quick reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release on PC back in March. However, in a bizarre series of events, it transpired that developer Fntastic had failed to trademark the game's name, which had subsequently been contested by a company behind a calendar app.

I jest of course. The Armored Core series is very much its own thing. But the inclusion of this iconic weapon is a fun Easter egg present through most FromSoftware games.


The weapon first appeared in the studio's 1994 game King's Field as the Moonlight Sword and has since appeared in most of its games in various guises, from Dark Souls to Bloodborne, Elden Ring, and past Armored Core games.
