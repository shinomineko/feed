        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld is now the sixth game to ever hit more than a million concurrent players on Steam.
Palworld – described as "Pokémon with guns" – has been breaking records left and right all weekend, and it has now sold more than four million copies since it released in early access on Friday on Steam and Xbox Series X/S.
All weekend, the monster-collecting survival game has been climbing the charts, and not only is it now Steam's most popular game all weekend – with a 1.2m concurrent players peak in the last 24 hours alone (that's more simultaneous players than PUBG, Counter-Strike 2, and Dota 2) – it has also surpassed the concurrent records for games like Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3, and Elden Ring.

This time, the full-screen advertisements – which players currently cannot opt-out from – were to raise awareness about last week's Developer Direct showcase.
"The Xbox consoles are not and never were advertised or sold as a subsidised device, but the ads are sure making it feel like one," posted one irate player. "This feels akin to getting an Amazon Kindle at a discount because its ad supported.

Talking on The Infinite Podcast, Nick didn't claim to know when the hitherto PlayStation 5 console exclusive would make the jump to Xbox-flavoured consoles, but given Final Fantasy 16's PS5 exclusivity doesn't expire until June 2024, you probably shouldn't expect it any sooner than Q3 2024 at the earliest.

Pre-orders for the 80cm long Psyduck, known as Kodak in Japan, are now live, but will close on 19th February or whenever it sells out – whichever is sooner. The toy itself is expected to ship in mid-July, and costs ¥30,800, which is around £165 / $207.
Sadly, the plushie will only ship internally in Japan, and there's no sign of the larger-than-life version in either the UK or US Pokémon online stores just yet.

Right now, players who use the "Memory Reset Drug" may see a permanent reduction in their capture power, and whilst the development team says is investigating the issue, it suggests players "please refrain from using it until the investigation/correction is complete".
"Currently, using the item 'Memory Reset Drug' that resets the player’s status may reduce the player’s capture power and make it impossible to recover," Pocketpair's Kei told the Discord community (thanks, PCGN).

"We’ve been laying the groundwork for the return of some fan-favourite features in upcoming seasons, which has required a degree of preemptive setup in our live environment," Raven explained on X/Twitter.

"Pokémon with guns" survival game Palworld  – which released as an early access title yesterday, 19th January, and has already sold over 2m copies – but it's now facing claims that the similarities between it and Pokémon are too great to be coincidental.
"Reminder not to support Palworld," wrote one unhappy user on X/Twitter. "It's not even subtle about its rip-offs, how much else has it stolen?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans think they've spotted a reference to a new Quake game hiding in plain sight in Microsoft's latest Developer Direct presentation.
As spotted by ResetEra's JigglesBunny – in a segment about puzzles in the newly-announced Indiana Jones and the Great Circle game – players think they can just make out the Quake symbol and a little text: "AKE 6" written in the foreground on a whiteboard.
No, it's not concrete proof – for one thing, it's hard to imagine there'll be a Quake 6 before a Quake 5 – whilst the letters themselves could be coincidental, it's unlucky that the logo itself is there by accident. And though it's plausible that the game could be on the board simply as an inspiration for puzzle design, that still wouldn't explain the "6" next to the letters and logo, too. Curiouser and curiouser.

Operations will run for just four to six weeks at a time, and their accompanying battle passes will sport just 20 tiers. It's a significant change from the free-to-play shooter's typically weighty, long-running seasons, and could be a sign that 343i is now scaling back on the 2021 game.

Thankfully, that's where the curse of the video game sevens ends, with no sign of the number across the remaining seven PlayStation 4 titles currently listed under the 'Last chance to play' section of the PlayStation dashboard. Oh.


Alongside the zombie, fight-y, plane-y departures mentioned in the opening paragraph, Sony has revealed Playstation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers will soon be losing access to sci-fi narrative adventure Tacoma, colour-based platform-puzzler Hue, ageing indie darling Thomas Was Alone, and Lost Words: Beyond the Page.

<p>I wrote to Zelle about it. Or, at least, I wrote to a company called <a href="https://www.earlywarning.com/">Early Warning</a> that owns Zelle about it. They asked me where the ads appeared. This seems odd to me. Podcast distribution networks drop ads in podcasts depending on the listener&#8212;like personalized ads on webpages&#8212;so the actual podcast doesn&#8217;t matter. And shouldn&#8217;t they know their own ads? Annoyingly, it seems time to get attorneys involved...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eye-catching 'Pokémon with guns' survival game Palworld has already sold a staggering 1m copies according to its developer Pocketpair, just hours into its early access launch on Steam and Xbox Series X/S. That's as the studio addresses the lack of 32-player dedicated servers on Xbox and PC Game Pass, saying the situation is "not up to us".


Palworld's whole thing, if you're unfamiliar, is that it combines Pokémon-style creature catching with open-world survival and crafting, giving players the option to exploit (or eat) their Pals in the name of completing tasks more efficiently if they so choose.


It's a proposition that's evidently resonated with  players in a big way; Pocketpair has taken to social media to announce that Palworld "has sold over 1m copies in about eight hours since release". That's an astonishing number, particularly given that Palworld's day-one inclusion on Game Pass means plenty of people can play right now without directly purchasing the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2024, our first look ahead at the year to come from one of the big three console makers. 
The big draw was Indiana Jones and The Great Circle from Wolfenstein maker MachineGames, a blockbuster action adventure clearly set up to be Microsoft's answer to Uncharted. But there was also the brilliant-looking Hellblade 2, the eye-catching sequel from Ninja Theory we've been looking forward to for years. 
Then there's Avowed, a fantasy RPG to satisfy those waiting patiently for the next Elder Scrolls and who might prefer a bit more colour to their role-playing than in Starfield. Finally, we saw Visions of Mana from Square Enix and Ara: History Untold for PC. But was this enough to make for a satisfying show - and more importantly, set the tone for what is hopefully a better year of Xbox first-party launches than in 2023? I'm joined by Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan to discuss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As The Elder Scrolls Online thunders toward its 10th anniversary this April, Zenimax Online Studios has whipped back the sheet to reveal the fantasy MMO's latest expansion chapter, Gold Road, which launches for PC and Mac on 3rd June with a PlayStation and Xbox release to follow a few weeks' later on 18th June.


Gold Road gives players the opportunity to explore the bountiful region of West Weald (split into temperate, woodland, and highland zones) as well as the city of Skingrad, first seen in the The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Unfortunately, the region has now been "beset by Daedric incursions and the encroaching jungles of Valenwood", meaning there's heroing to be done.


As players journey across West Weald, they'll encounter new quests, challenges, rewards, and stories, with Gold Road's new main storyline - said to offer around 30 hours of quest content - focusing on Daedric prince Ithelia, and the chaos their followers may bring to Tamriel.

Palworld developer Pocketpair has said that the game is proving so popular, its servers are struggling to keep up.

To be clear, if you have been playing as the same character since Destiny 1, this will be the first time in a decade that you will have been able to update your Guardian's basic appearance. 


The ability to do so has been a long, long-requested thing from fans. Now, Bungie has said the option will be implemented this year, ahead of its climactic (and delayed) expansion The Final Shape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu believes the company needs to diversify its gaming output, but also focus on fewer releases.


Kiryu's comments are from an investor Q&A from November just recently published in English, in which he addressed multiple questions - in particular regarding the company's medium-term business plan and what Kiryu described as "the limited diversity of our title portfolio".


"Because we possess strong IPs like the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy franchises, I believe that we have tended to be overly reliant on certain gameplay styles or genres," he said. "Meanwhile, the tastes of customers in the gaming market have diversified, and customers have come to enjoy content from a variety of genres."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pablo Schreiber, the face (quite literally) behind Master Chief's helmet in Paramount's Halo adaptation, thinks it was a "huge mistake" to introduce a romantic relationship for the Spartan warrior. In fact, he pushed back against it. 


As a reminder, in the first season of Halo, Schreiber's John-117 has sex with human-turned-Covenant agent Makee, as Cortana watches on. They were Cortana in the act, if you will. 


While the intercorse itself wasn't actually shown, with the two lovers merely seen touching scars and so on before waking up in bed together, it is very heavily implied. Many felt this was a mistake for the series, along with Master Chief showing both his face and his naked derriere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8 will be making some changes to its accessibility features after players and specialists raised concerns when playing the demo.
Last month, players using the game's colour blind options reported falling ill with vertigo and migraines, and many people spoke about the need for changes on social media.
Tekken 8 director Katushiro Harada responded and said people had "misunderstood" the accessibility options, which developer Bandai Namco had "never claimed or publicised" would be useful to all colour blind players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[35 percent of game developers have been impacted by layoffs in the last 12 months and half are concerned more job cuts are on the way. That's according to GDC's newly published 2024 State of the Game Industry report, which highlights current sentiment among developers based on a snapshot of 3,000 industry professionals polled.


According to the report, while 54 percent of developers canvassed said there had been no layoffs at their company over the last year, 35 percent said either they or their colleagues had lost their jobs. Quality assurance positions are said to have been hit the hardest, with 22 percent of QA workers saying they'd been laid off compared to seven percent of all developers.


56 percent of those polled said they were concerned their company could announce more layoffs in the next 12 months, with many citing post-pandemic course correction, studio conglomeration, and economic uncertainty as possible explanations.

MachineGames' Indiana Jones was the biggie of course, showcasing first gameplay and featuring confirmation of a 2024 release, but there was more besides, with Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, Avowed, and Oxide Games' Ara: History Untold all putting in an appearance.


And if you missed the showcase - which included a surprise visit from Square Enix to offer another look at this year's Visions of Mana - you'll find a brisk round-up below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MachineGames has given us our first look at its Indiana Jones game, now officially called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (as suspected). And that's not all! We officially now know it is coming this year. Get your fedoras at the ready, our beloved professor will be whipping his way onto Xbox Series X/S and PC, including Game Pass, in 2024.


Thanks to the new footage, which was shared at this evening's Xbox Developer Direct, we also have some nice background bits about the upcoming game, which we will play through the eyes of Indy as a lot of it is first person (it's the "ideal perspective," the developer said). Oh, and Todd Howard also popped up to compliment how accommodating Lucasfilm has been. 


Now, let's talk new footage. It, of course, all started with Nazis, with the Great Circle taking place between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade (and yes, Indy looks like Harrison Ford complete with scar on chin). Oh, I really want this to be Xbox's Uncharted but more. The new footage provides plenty of little gameplay snippets that are also in the films, such as a hole filled with spiders that I assume has a lever inside. Indy is shown reaching in as a spider pops out, anyway.

Via a deeper dive into the game, Oxide showed some of its world leaders and infamous players in history whose skills you'll be able to use as you build your own version of history on an alternate Earth. Jeanne d'Arc, Boudica and Genghis Khan are all on the list.


You win games by competing against rivals, taking turns simultaneously while trying to gain Prestige - such as by constructing Triumphs, monuments from throughout history such as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Daemonhunters originally launched for PC back in 2022, delivering what Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a "brutal but graceful and comprehensible mix of ideas from Warhammer, XCOM and Gears Tactics". Also, Andy Serkis is in it.


The whole thing is focused on the Grey Knights, a mysterious Chapter of the Space Marines, who go up against the Death Guard and the forces of Chaos god Nurgle in a story told across a cinematic, narrative-driven campaign. It features a fully customisable squad of units - which can be tailored with different skills, psychic abilities, equipment, armour, class specialisations, voices, and facial options - and is, all in all, a jolly good old time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar has announced it's removing Grand Theft Auto Online's clips editor on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from 20th February this year, explaining it's making the move as it approaches the "limits of what's possible" on previous-generation consoles.


The clips editor - officially known as the Rockstar Editor - was introduced back in 2015, enabling players to create, edit, and share videos of Grand Theft Auto 5 and Grand Theft Auto Online. However, from 20th February, the editor, including all clips and projects saved within, will no longer be available to PS4 and Xbox One users.


"As we begin to approach the limits of what's possible within the technical capacity of previous-generation consoles," Rockstar explained in a post on its blog, "we are taking necessary steps to allow for future GTA Online updates on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One." It added that removing the editor from last-gen consoles will "help to ensure the stability of these platforms and keep them updated with GTA Online additions for as long as possible."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker, the duo that co-founded  acclaimed Batman Arkham studio Rocksteady before departing to "start a new adventure together in games" in 2022, have set up a new AAA London development studio, Hundred Star Games.


Hundred Star Games' existence certainly isn't a secret - it already has a website and a detailed Great Place to Work listing - but its connection to Hill and Walker has only just started to become more widely known thanks to a new report by Polygon, which spotted the duo were named as Hundred Star's directors on corporate data website Endole.


Hundred Star hasn't yet announced itself to press, and only a limited amount of information is currently available. On Great Place to Work, the East London studio says its ethos is to create a "small team of only 100 industry veterans and emerging talents, who are committed to crafting cutting-edge gaming experiences that inspire and captivate players worldwide."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft's long-in-the-works movie adaptation continues to pick up steam, with the news White Lotus star Jennifer Coolidge has now joined its cast.


Word of Coolidge's arrival on the project comes via Deadline, but the publication offers no word on the role she'll be playing. That's to be expected, given story details are being kept under wraps - although a report last year suggested it would focus on a "malevolent Ender Dragon who sets out on a path of destruction".


Coolidge - who strode back into the spotlight with her widely acclaimed two-season portrayal of Tanya McQuoid in HBO's stellar 2021 series White Lotus following an already impressive decades-long acting career - joins a cast including Game of Thrones' Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Jack Black.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Supermassive's acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game Until Dawn is being turned into a movie by the writer and director of 2017 horror hit Annabelle: Creation.


Until Dawn, if you're unfamiliar, released for PS4 back in 2015, delivering an interactive spin on the teen slasher genre - with a cast including Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere - where players could influence who lived and who died through the choices they made along its branching narrative. It was a cheesy, atmospheric, and hugely enjoyable romp, establishing the template Supermassive would later revisit in its recent Dark Pictures Anthology series.


Given that much of Until Dawn's appeal came from the novelty of navigating through a whole bunch of knowingly trope-y slasher conventions (who hasn't pondered if they'd have what it takes to survive a horror movie and become Final Girl), it's perhaps an unexpected choice for a big screen adaptation - but the film's being described as a "R-rated love letter to the horror genre", suggesting it'll retain some of the meta elements of its inspiration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has vowed more legal action against Apple, just days after the US Supreme Court dismissed both parties' further attempts to appeal a 2021 California court ruling on the Epic vs. Apple antitrust lawsuit.


Epic initially launched court proceedings against Apple back in August 2020, after the company revoked Epic's Fortnite developer account, preventing the game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees.


A decision on Epic's lawsuit came in September 2021, when Judge Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. Gonzalez-Rogers did, however, side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers from linking out to alternative payment methods from within their apps - a practice known as "anti-steering" - as that would constitute "anti-competitive conduct" under state law.

Mazin's comments come after Bill actor Nick Offerman said a The Last of Us spin-off following the two survivors had been pitched to HBO. "I think we pitched a whole mini-series of a prequel of their lives before they met each other," Offerman said, before joking: "It could be a musical. We're not short on ideas. We'll just, we'll see what Craig [Mazin] and Neil [Druckmann] come up with."
Speaking with Deadline, Mazin reiterated that Offerman was joking with his previous comments, which were made following the actor's Emmy win. "I'm very proud of the episode we did with Bill and Frank," Mazin said, later adding: "We are very happy with what we achieved."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, Paradox Interactive has increased the price of its expansion subscription to Europa Universalis 4 in multiple regions, but not to the extent some players were worried about. 
Yesterday, several Canadian players shared emails they received from Steam which said the monthly price for their subscription had gone up to $122, a 21-fold increase on its initial price of $5.70. 
The price in Canada was quickly updated to $10.99, a much more sensible figure.

The director was asked by VGC his thoughts on the backlash remakes and remasters - such as Naughty Dog's upcoming native PS5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 - are often met with. After all, the original game came out less than four years ago. 


"I don't understand some of the consternation about what The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered offers," Gallant replied, adding he believes this release is "the best way to play The Last of Us Part 2, if you're a new PlayStation owner and new to the franchise".

The fundraising event is currently underway, having begun on Sunday. As previously reported, streamer JSR_'s pet dog Peanut Butter was scheduled to be the first pet, and the first dog, to complete a speedrun for AGDQ.
Peanut Butter speedran Gyromite, a puzzle platformer released on the NES, in 26 minutes and 24 seconds, which is around a minute slower than his own world record, but well within the 30 minute slot he'd been allocated. Frankly, every Peanut Butter run is a PB record.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI&#8217;s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants&#8217; language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Christian made the comments on X, formerly Twitter, following the latest trailer for Rebirth shared by Square Enix. Longtime fans of the original Final Fantasy 7 game (as well as Remake) have plenty of opinions on who Cloud's love interest should be in the Tifa/Aerith love triangle, which has caused plenty of heated online debates.



"'Shippers' crumble under the idea that a character is allowed to have significant relationships with MULTIPLE characters. This provides overarching depth," said Christian (thanks Games Radar). "The need to overtly sexualize every relationship can ruin great story development."

In a thread on X, formerly Twitter, Vincke shared his views on subscription models in response to yesterday's news that Ubisoft is evolving its service. Ubisoft's director of subscription Philippe Tremblay said players need to be "comfortable" not owning games when discussing the range of consumer behaviour.


"Whatever the future of games looks like, content will always be king," said Vincke. "But it's going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not. Direct from developer to players is the way."

First off, that new mode. Embark calls Solo Bank It both "experimental" and a "fast-paced all-in-action" experience, so you are sure to be kept on your toes. It pits 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. Those taking on Solo Bank It need to scoop up a total of 40,000 Cash to claim victory. 


The developer notes strategy is a key factor in this mode, as you won't have a squad backing you up for you to rely on. You can see a little tease of what's in store via the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Baldur's Gate 3's save bug woes on Xbox Series X/S might finally - fingers crossed - be at an end. The long-awaited fix that developer Larian Studios recently promised would arrive this week is now available to download.


Xbox players have suffered save game woes ever since Baldur's Gate 3 made its delayed debut on the console at the end of last year, with reports soon emerging that hard-earned progress was being wiped after crashing. Unfortunately, the issue has persisted as the weeks have gone by, and Larian recently confirmed a permanent fix would require a console update from Microsoft, which was still in the works at the time.


Finally though, after an agonising five-and-a-half-week wait, Microsoft's long-promised fix is now here. Its arrival was confirmed by the official Xbox Support account on social media, which tweeted, "An Xbox System Update will be rolling out from today to address the Save Game issue on Baldur's Gate 3." All Xbox Series X/S players should automatically receive the update within the next week, it noted, but those wanting it sooner can manually force the update immediately via their console's Settings menu.

"Ancient forces threaten Sanctuary," the studio writes in a bout of scene-setting over on its blog. "Aided by your Seneschal Companion, hazard the many traps and devastating Constructs beneath the deserts of Kehjistan." Here, it continues, "elemental forces are amassing for malicious whims of the demon Malphas. Only by descending far below the surface will you be able to cull this cursed threat from its root."


Breaking that down into more specific terms, Season of the Construct introduces the seasonal robotic Seneschal Companion - available during the Seasonal Questline - a new dungeon type Blizzard is calling Vaults, weekly leaderboards in The Gauntlet, and a number of "key" new quality of life features, including WASD movement support on PC.

Writing in a new post on the PlayStation Blog, Aspyr explains it wanted to focus on "additions instead of revisions" when developing Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered, saying it believes the "gameplay of [the originals] is timeless."


To that end, it's adding the option to toggle between the three games' "classic" tank-like controls and a more modern alternative, which takes inspiration from Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld; here, full camera control is mapped to the right stick, while Lara moves directionally based on the camera position.

Final Fantasy 14 has been a long time coming to Xbox; it launched for PC and PlayStation back in 2013, but it wasn't until last summer that Microsoft and developer Square Enix confirmed it'd finally be making the leap to Xbox - specifically Xbox Series X/S consoles - in "spring 2024".


At the time, Microsoft said Final Fantasy 14 Online's full Xbox arrival would be preceded by an open beta, planned to coincide with the game's patch 6.5X. And with Patch 6.55 out today, 16th January, signs suggest Final Fantasy 14's Xbox open beta is imminent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves' 11th season is right around the corner, and it looks like its arrival next Tuesday, 23rd January, could very well bring the most radical overhaul for the multiplayer pirate adventure since its launch back in 2018. Behold the advent of fast-travel.


As per Rare's latest video update, Sea of Thieves' Season 11 makes sweeping changes to the way voyages are accessed and activated. Previously, voyages - essentially self-contained quests directing players to specific themed activities, if you're familiar - could only be purchased from trading company representatives at one of the game's starting outposts. That meant a whole lot of time spent engaged in often wholly uneventful sailing as you traversed back and forth across the map to pick up new voyages, drop off loot, and on.


From Season 11 onward, however, all voyages will be immediately accessible at any time from the updated Quest Table on your ship. Here, you'll get on-demand access to trading company voyages (ranked by length), Tall Tales, and more, meaning you can dive straight into any voyage type you fancy without first needing to take a lengthy trip back to an outpost to buy it.

Speaking with VGC, Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani said the team had "dabbled" with AI program Midjourney - a known AI tool that converts text into art - but the majority of the game has been crafted by hand.


"All of the core elements in Foamstars - the core gameplay, and the things that make the game enjoyable - those are all made by hand," Okatani said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has revealed a release date for the survival horror sequel of 5th September, 2024.
This marks a further delay to the game, which was intially meant to release in April 2022. Since then, the game has been delayed several times for polishing and due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Most recently, Stalker 2 was rumoured to be releasing in December 2023 before GSC Game World pencilled in a launch window of Q1 2024.
"While there is absolutely no way to make another delay sound less dim," GSC Game World said in a press statement, "we decided to be clear about our reasons to postpone the game for the sake of yet another wave of polishing." GSC stated the game contained "certain technical imperfections" at the beginning of the year, making it clear the game "needed more time in the oven".

"I can say that Persona 3 Reload's promise is undeniable," wrote Henry Stockdale in Eurogamer's preview of the game. "Remaking an RPG with such a vast legacy would prove daunting for many, yet even with the omissions, Atlus is building on the original game's foundations well. After many years of waiting, I'm excited to dive in properly next month."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take Two Interactive has entered a trademark dispute with Remedy Entertainment, and says the latter's logo resembles the R* of Rockstar Games.


Remedy revealed this logo in a blog post back in April last year. "The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old," it wrote at the time. "It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today's Remedy."


The new logo is a stylised R, but as reported by RespawnFirst, this has been opposed by Take-Two as "there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public".

In a statement on the latest holdup, publisher Soma Games said the decision was a "tactical move" to aim for a different release window. 


The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology was previously set to arrive on 30th January for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. It's a linear, story-based action adventure set in the world of Brian Jacques' brilliant children's fantasy books, collecting three acts previously sold separately.

Ubisoft+ will now feature two revised tiers. Ubisoft+ Premium (£14.99/$17.99 per month) will include all new releases and - in some cases - early access to games alongside premium editions, monthly rewards and more. Ubisoft+ Classics on PC, meanwhile, is a brand new curated selection of popular back-catalogue and live games (£6.99/$7.99 per month).


Director of subscription Philippe Tremblay told GamesIndustry.biz there is "tremendous opportunity for growth" for subscription models, but the mindset of consumers needs to change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The director of Warner Bros' upcoming Minecraft film adaptation wants to avoid any kind of fan reaction akin to that 'Ugly Sonic' reveal. 


As a reminder, 'Ugly Sonic' was the original design for Sonic from the 2020 film, starring Jim Carrey and James Marsden. On Sonic's initial full reveal in the first trailer, many were left unimpressed (to put it mildly) by the direction the designers had gone. But even before that there was concern, when posters teasing Sonic's cinematic release showed the hedgehog's oddly lithe silhouette and his nightmarish legs.


In fact, the criticism surrounding Sonic's seemingly final look was so loud, the team went back to the drawing board and redesigned the titular blue hedgehog to a less controversial model. If you need a reminder, you can see the Sonic designs in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raven Software was at one time working on a standalone live-service version of Call of Duty's popular Zombies mode, ex-Raven Software lead designer Michael Gummelt has revealed, but it was cancelled after its IP originator - presumably Treyarch - "wanted it back".


That small revelation comes via Gummelt's LinkedIn page (as spotted by MP1ST), which explains he was lead designer on an "ambitious new Call of Duty: Zombies live service project" between 2011 and 2012, but that the whole thing was canceled "when the [Activision] studio that 'owned' that part of the Call of Duty IP wanted it back."


Gummelt doesn't explicitly state the name of the studio, but it seems reasonable to assume he's referring to developer Treyarch, who created the mode for 2008's Call of Duty: World at War.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller caused controversy among players by revealing major gameply changes that'll see tank and damage heroes receive a "modified, tuned-down version of the Support self-healing passive" in Season 9 - and Keller has now admitted it was a "mistake" to make the announcement "out of context".


In his original announcement on the Overwatch blog, Keller explained the changes - part of a wider gameplay overhaul intended to reduce 'frustration' when teams aren't working together - should "give non-Support players more options in terms of sustaining themselves" and "take some of the pressure off Support players to keep everyone alive since individual players now have more control of their own health pool." The idea, he explained, was to shift the balance "between the power of a team and the power of an individual hero or player."


Since that announcement, there've been concerns among the Overwatch community that the changes might fundamental undermine the team-based spirit of Overwatch, while others have worried the shift may risk making Support characters redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Wildcard has announced revised release dates for Ark: Survival Ascended's The Center and Scorched Earth expansion map remasters following a delay for the latter last year, confirming they'll arrival in February and April respectively.


A spruced-up version of Scorched Earth was originally due to launch alongside Ark: Survival Ascended - the controversial full-price remaster of Wildcard's 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved - last year. However, in July, the studio announced that not only was it pushing the launch of the base game back to October, its expansions would be delayed too.


As per its revised plans, Scorched Earth was now targeting a December launch, with Ascended's remastered Ragnarok and Aberration maps due in "Q1 2024". Unfortunately, it became apparent Wildcard's propensity for delays had struck again when a updated roadmap released in December showed Scorched Earth was now due in March 2024, with Aberration aiming for July 2024 and Raganarok not unexpected until September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rebel Wolves - the studio formed by a number of ex-CD Projekt staff, including Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - has confirmed its first project will be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker, after the title was reported online toward the end of last year.


When Rebel Wolves announced its existence in 2022, the studio said its mission was to "evolve the cRPG genre by creating unforgettable stories and stirring deep emotions", confirming its first project would be a then-unnamed "AAA dark fantasy built inside the Unreal 5 engine".


Since then, official word on Rebel Wolves' debut game has been limited, although CEO Tomaszkiewicz - who also served as a secondary director on Cyberpunk 2077 while at CD Projekt - did tease it wouldn't "be as gigantic as The Witcher" but could well have a "greater" number of quests. In the same interview, he also suggested the project would be around the same size as the Witcher 3's Blood and Wine expansion.

The update was shared by Ziostorm on X, after the user noticed Elden Ring's DLC category had been amended on SteamDB. The update in question doesn't have a name, and is merely listed as "SteamDB Unknown App 2778580" for now. However, many have speculated the developer will be making an announcement regarding the expansion's release date in the near future. We will keep you posted. 


Other DLC listed in this section of Elden Ring's Steam page includes the game's digital artbook and soundtrack, as well as its Adventure Guide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're just a week away from the launch of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for PlayStation 5, and the studio has now announced it'll be marking its arrival with Grounded 2 - an official making-of documentary that'll be free to watch on YouTube.


Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, to give it its full name, is the sequel to Naughty Dog's 85-minute making-of documentary for the original Last of Us, which launched back in 2015 and charted the "dogged development and unique philosophy" of the first game.


Filming of the newly announced follow-up - as per the spoiler-y trailer below - started in 2016 but was abandoned when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020. However, the existing footage has now been revisited and assembled into a making-of documentary that doesn't look like it'll entirely shy away from the more negative aspects of development at Naughty Dog, including crunch - a practice said to be particularly brutal at the studio in a report back in 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Bethesda looking to ramp up the frequency of its Starfield updates in 2024 - it recently committed to a "roughly every six weeks" schedule starting in February - the studio is kicking off the new year by putting its latest patch into Steam beta next Wednesday, 17th January, with the promise of "over 100 fixes and improvements".


Bethesda says it'll share the full update notes when the Steam beta goes live on Wednesday but, ahead of launch, it's teased a number of included improvements in a series of posts on social media. Next week's update will, for instance, introduce improved textures, lighting, and shadows - the accompanying screenshots point to far more natural illumination on character's faces, for instance - as well as additional widescreen support and stability improvements. 


Bethesda is also promising a "multitude of fixes" to quests, remedying the likes of docking and data transfer problems in Eye of the Storm, as well as preventing exploration blockers caused by missing temples in Into the Unknown.

News that development on Missouri is now underway brings the total list of explorable states released or announced for American Truck Simulator since its launch in 2016 all the way up to 16. So far, players can trundle their way across California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma, with Nebraska, Arkansas and Missouri still to come (presumably in that order).


Announcing the Missouri expansion on Steam - which actually happened just before Christmas but I was off and likely in an extended brandy butter stupor at the time, so sorry for the delay - SCS wrote, "Nestled in the heart of the American Midwest, Missouri beckons with a blend of historical significance, natural beauty, and vibrant urban landscapes. Known as the Show-Me State, Missouri invites visitors to explore its diverse offerings."

Yoshida was interviewed by Sony's Shuhei Yoshida on the Game Maker's Notebook podcast (Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences) and candidly discussed development of Final Fantasy 14 and 16, as well as the future of the series.


When jokingly asked if he's directing Final Fantasy 17, Yoshida replied that nothing has been decided yet. "I've had the chance to work on two of these, 14 and 16, so maybe it's time for someone new, instead of having the same old guys handle the next one," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, the well-received Three Kingdoms-era Soulslike from developer Team Ninja, is bundling its base game and all DLC into a single Complete Edition, launching for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and PC on 7th February.


Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which originally launched last March, serves up a challenging - but surprisingly approachable - action-RPG adventure build around a faster, more aggressive style of combat compared to Team Ninja's previous Nioh games.


"A new setting may suggest a new chapter," Eurogamer contributor Alan Wen wrote in his Recommended review, "but I'd almost prefer to call Wo Long a Nioh-like, or rather the sequel that Nioh 2 should have been, further refining its systems and customisation, cutting back some if not all bloat, and adding an exciting evolution of its foundations that makes its masocore challenge more approachable on its own terms."

Both Portal 64, a demake to port the original Portal to the N64, and Team Fortress: Source 2, an effort to "recreate a new [Team Fortress] experience" in the Source 2 engine, were targeted by Valve.
On 10th January, the creators of each project released statements confirming the end of development and that each will no longer be available to download.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land, the upcoming game based on Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama's manga, will release on 26th April across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.


Sand Land, for those unaware, is set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply for everyone. Yes, demons and humans. Obviously, something needs to be done about that, and so a rag-tag team sets off in search of the Legendary Spring to bring an end to this thirst.


Sand Land was first announced last year at Summer Games Fest, where we got a look at its arid setting and gorgeous art style. You can see it again now thanks to its new release date trailer, below.

<blockquote><p>Smart Device Manufacturer Liability and Redress for Third-Party Cyberattack Victims</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Smart devices are used to facilitate cyberattacks against both their users and third parties. While users are generally able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and yet un-remediated bug in the smart device&#8217;s code, this lacuna is unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway, which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer of the smart device is proposed...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has rolled back a recent update to 11-year-old game Resident Evil Revelations which added a DRM called Enigma Protector.
The DRM was noticed after Steam players began reporting errors when launching Revelations last week, including a reduced and unstable framerate, as well as broken mods.
Steam users review bombed Revelations with complaints about Enigma, which prompted Capcom to roll back the game on 9th January (which can be seen on its history via SteamDB).

"We've implied this before where we say we need to run it sustainably," said Clancy, "but I'll be blunt: we aren't profitable at this point."

The upcoming 2.5D Metroidvania game features the regular human-voiced cast you'd expect, bar one character: a tree spirit named Kalux. Kalux only has a small handful of lines throughout the game, but these have been left with work-in-progress generated dialogue.


Ubisoft has said it plans to add human-recorded dialogue at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that feels a little like being catapulted back in time several decades, Ubisoft has released a free playable Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown demo - for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC - ahead of the game's full launch next week.


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown revives Ubisoft's shamefully long-dormant action-platforming series for a new generation - a new generation that wouldn't even have been born when the last game came out in 2008, thanks to Ubisoft's dallying - this time sending the prince's protector Sargon on a Metroidvania-style quest packed with side-scrolling combat and platform action.


Early word on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - which has been developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the wonderful Rayman Legends and Origins - is reassuringly positive, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman calling it a "supremely polished, ultra smooth game that perfectly leverages every platform it has shipped on."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well here's one way of getting yourself some free publicity: casually announce your product will be releasing alongside Switch 2 this "September" so everyone excitedly thinks you might have just accidentally splurged Nintendo's big secret, then, when you're confronted about it, give a little shrug and admit you were just "guessing".


That's pretty much what happened today when audio company Altec Lansing shared a press release unveiling a partnership with GameShark (now AI Shark) that'll see it release a new AI-powered GameShark successor - an announcement casually tossing in the sentence, "The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024."


Unsurprisingly, Nintendo fans desperate for Switch 2 news following persistent reports the console is launching this year (hello, I am one of these people) immediately began to wonder if Altec Lansing - not a small company by any stretch of the imagination - might have just inadvertently shared some highly confidential information they shouldn't have.

As reported by The Verge, employees at Discord were informed of the job cuts today by CEO Jason Citron in an all-hands meeting and accompanying internal email.


"Today we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to reduce the size of Discord's workforce by 17%," Citron wrote in the email shared by The Verge. "This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one that we have conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our mission over the long term."

However, creator Poncle isn't done yet, and it's now share a revised development roadmap (of sorts) for its perennially vampire-free minimalist survival RPG, which includes an update on cross-saves and a potential online co-op mode.


All this comes in a new goodbye 2023/hello 2024 post shared over on Steam, which begins with a recap of the year just gone and a thanks to players before moving onto matters in Vampires Survivors' near and not-so-near future.


That includes a word on the progress of online co-op support for the game, which Poncle confirmed it was "investigating" back in September last year. A little over three months on and the studio says it's "still investigating" the feature, explaining that to "retro-fit online multiplayer in a game as simple as this, but with so much content, is still a huge challenge."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're big of years but small of shelf space, you might be interested in the newly announced 400 Mini, an officially licensed scaled-down version of Atari's four-and-a-half decade old home computer, the Atari 400, which launches on 28th March this year.


Created by Retro Games Ltd - the company previously responsible for the C64 Mini and Amiga 500 Mini - the 400 Mini sports a similar design to Atari's 1979 8-bit computer (albeit approximately half the size) but can do a little more beyond its inspiration.


As per Retro Games' announcement, the 400 Mini (styled THE400 Mini) doesn't just emulate the Atari 400 hardware, it's also emulates the entire 8-bit Atari range, including the 400's pricier sibling the Atari 800, plus the XL and XE series, and the 5200 home console.

He said players would be able to make his in-game character "play certain themes" during the then-unannounced remastered's release. 


Now, we have a closer look at just what Santaolalla was talking about, thanks to a new marketing beat for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.


Santaolalla's cameo will actually be part of the game's Guitar Free Play mode. Although, rather than playing the guitar as we have seen Joel doing in promo shots for the upcoming release, he will play the banjo.

This release will be a souped up version of IOI's 2006 title Hitman: Blood Money. It promises a host of improvements across 12 "highly-replayable" missions, including new features such as Instinct Mode, an ever-present minimap, and an array of gameplay improvements inspired by later games in IOI's Hitman series. Of course, outfit changes and using as many different weapons and/or methods as you can is fully encouraged.


Here is a little trailer for it all, showing off some shenanigans across the globe. While I have no interest in becoming an assassin myself, I am rather jealous of Agent 47's travel opportunities.

New Cycle is described as dieselpunk by Core Engage, as the player is tasked with rebuilding society following a "global catastrophe" caused by solar flares. Settlements begin as very basic and players must progress into industrialisation, then capitalism, all whilst tackling the challenges thrown at them by the environment.
The gameplay overview takes us through each of these stages briefly, showing the transformation from a small hunter-gatherer settlement, to a larger industrial town with electricity and factories, before expanding and building a railway to enable trade and tourism.

Befitting their powerful status and space-time warping properties, the pair will debut a new feature for Pokémon Go named Adventure Effects. These are gameplay-changing abilities unlocked by interacting with the creature itself that can also be boosted further using in-game resources.

The new trailer reveals multiplayer will come in the form of local co-op, and it looks like a second player will get to control Toad. Take a look at what's in store for Mario in the trailer below.

Season of Blood - the game's current season - is set to come to a close soon, with the next season then starting up on 23rd January. So, in just under two weeks.


While Blizzard itself has not 'announced' this date at the time of writing, a message has been spotted in Diablo 4 itself proclaiming it to be so. As you can see in the image below, when players boot up the game, they are met with a notice on the character selection screen that reads: "Season 3. Next season begins January 23, 2024".

The odd-looking and robotic-sounding Mario was the work of Proto Hologram, a company that creates holograms held within large box-like structures that you can talk to and interact with. 


More bizarre still, the Mario hologram was supposed to be a collaboration with the AARP, an American advocacy group for people over the age of 50 - apparently to demonstrate how AI holograms could combat loneliness in the elderly. But with Mario? And more to the point - with a poorly-voiced, dead-eyed broken 3D model of Mario?

This assumption comes from social media user @Kurakasis, who shared their discovery on X last night. The user revealed that Lucasfilm has been registering a number of domain names that are variations on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle over recent days.

The V2 DualSense will have an "exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge" according to the Best Buy listing, and also includes the DualSense charging station (which usually must be bought separately).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's shares have hit a record high as expectations around Switch 2 continue to grow, and amid speculation Saudi Arabia is set to further invest in Japanese video game stock.


That's according to Nikkei Asia (thanks VGC), which reports shares of Nintendo temporarily hit a record 7,902 today on Japan's Nikkei stock index - up 5% from yesterday - pushing its market capitalisation over 10 trillion yen ($69bn) for the first time since November 2007.


The publication notes the reason behind the recent surge in Nintendo's share price is two-fold. Firstly, growth expectations for the company are high in general, thanks to the success of its intellectual property related business, which recently announced a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, alongside the expected launch of Switch 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's shares have hit a record high as expectations around Switch 2 continue to grow, and amid speculation Saudi Arabia is set to further invest in Japanese video game stock.


That's according to Nikkei Asia (thanks VGC), which reports shares of Nintendo temporarily hit a record 7,902 today on Japan's Nikkei stock index - up 5% from yesterday - pushing its market capitalisation over 10 trillion yen ($69bn) for the first time since November 2007.


The publication notes the reason behind the recent surge in Nintendo's share price is two-fold. Firstly, growth expectations for the company are high in general, thanks to the success of its intellectual property related business, which recently announced a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, alongside the expected launch of Switch 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to May last year and you might remember EA canvassing The Sims 4 players to see if they'd prefer to see the game receive a Medieval Castle or High Tech Futurism themed building pack at some nebulous future point. Well, Medieval Castle (wrongly) won the vote, and some eight months later it looks like the DLC is ready for an imminent release.


That's according to a presumably premature reveal on the EA App (thanks SimsCommunity), which provides full details and screenshots of the The Sims 4 Castle Estate Kit, as the new DLC is officially known. It also offers up a release date of 15th October, 2099 - which is almost definitely a placeholder, unless EA really is in it for the long haul where The Sims 4 is concerned.


Weird date aside, everything else in the listing looks accurate. Alongside two screenshots featuring the new DLC pack's various building bits in action, we get some blurb explaining the Castle Estate Kit will enable The Sims 4 players to "capture the classic grandeur of a castle".

Those areas, specifically, are driver AI, car progression, and race regulations, and it sounds like fixing AI issues - which, as per Turn 10's update, include "abruptly braking and slowing down; not accelerating out of exits, braking too hard on mild corners, and following racing lines too strictly" - is first on its to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mojang and developer Blackbird Interactive have officially brought development on Minecraft Legends to a end today with one final content update, wrapping up a little under nine months of post-launch support for the real-time strategy spin-off.


Releasing in May last year, Minecraft Legends unfortunately didn't especially impress, proving to be a decidedly average RTS that failed to do much to justify its use of the Minecraft licence. "It feels too overwhelming and poorly explained for kids," Eurogamer contributor Caelyn Ellis wrote in her review, "too rudimentary for older players and too frustrating for both. Minecraft is, at least for me, about creativity and experimentation, but there's no room for that here."


Still, Mojang and Blackbird Interactive have continued to support Minecraft Legends with a series of post-launch content updates since its arrival, but Mojang has now confirmed today's Snow vs. Snouts update - initially announced during last year's Minecraft Live event and originally planned to launch in December - will be its last.

Elsewhere, there's an opportunity to revisit the PS4 version of the utterly wonderful LEGO City Undercover, developer TT Fusion's wildy imaginative and genuinely hilarious open-world take on the familiar Lego game formula, which plays out very much like a family friendly GTA.

Michelle, a woman of Chinese and Native American descent, appeared in the first Tekken game. Michelle was included in the next games until Tekken 3, which introduced her adoptive daughter Julia. Since then, Julia has appeared in the main series instead, with both making appearances in various Tekken spin-offs. 
Since their first appearances, Michelle and Julia have frequently been brought up in discussions of Indigenous representation in video games. Harada took to X (née Twitter) last week to acknowledge the characters' importance within the topic, explain the history of their designs, and ask for the opinions of Native American Tekken fans.

It is a fairly standard marketing beat, with others such as Insomniac and Nintendo doing the same thing for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom respectively. But what Insomniac and Nintendo didn't have (or who they didn't have) was Succession's Brian Cox to talk us through the story so far. 


Yes, the man that brought Logan Roy to life is here to tell us all about the Devil gene and more. "Every single fight, no matter how big or small, has a story behind it," the Scottish actor states as dramatic music starts to pound in the background. "There's one hell of a story to tell."


We then get told more about that aforementioned Devil gene, some cliff chucking exploits and the Tekken series' patricidal puzzle. You can have a watch for yourself below. I don't think it is meant to be funny, but it has made me chuckle.

"While crafting this new collection of DualSense controller and PS5 console cover colours, we drew inspiration from the beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth. We elevated the colours by adding a metallic finish for a touch of sophistication," designer Satoshi Aoyagi said at the time.

The news was shared in a new blog post from CEO Dan Clancy, including a copy of the internal email sent to staff. "We greatly value the employees we're saying goodbye to today as people and professionals and are grateful for all their efforts to support all of you," he wrote in the post. "Please know that Twitch remains focused on serving our streamers and ensuring that this is the best place to livestream for many years to come."
The included email confirms just over 500 people will lose their jobs. "This will be a very hard day. Our service exists to empower communities to create, together, and every single one of you has played a vital role in fostering our community and furthering that mission," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a day after Unity announced it would be laying off 1,800 employees as part of an ongoing "company reset", it's being reported that live-streaming site Twitch is now poised to cut 35 percent of its workforce - equalling around 500 jobs - later this week.


That's according to Bloomberg's Cecilia D'Anastasio, who, citing "people familiar with the plans", reports the cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday.


While Twitch declined to comment on the story when approached by Bloomberg, the publication claims the job cuts come amid continuing struggles for the live-streaming site. According to Bloomberg's sources, Twitch still remains unprofitable nine years after Amazon acquired the company for $970m.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld, the open-world survival and crafting adventure from developer Pocketpair that looks a lot like Pokémon with guns, is launching into early access on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass next Friday, 19th January.


Pocketpair describes Palworld as a "monster-catching, survival and crafting game" over on its Steam page, but notes it also features "a variety of mechanics from other genres in order to provide a completely new experience for everyone." And while harmonious living alongside the Pals you catch (initially totalling over 100) is certainly possible - with the likes of idyllic farming, land and sea exploration, dungeon crawling, battling, building, and breeding all featured - it also looks to have a darker side too, and not just because of those guns.


Players that choose to take on the game's ruthless poaching syndicate might, for example, find themselves traversing perilous climes where limited resources could mean they're forced to eat their Pals. Meanwhile, Pals can be put to work making fire, generating electricity, or mining ore, or sent to a factory line where they can be made to automate different tasks - until they drop dead, that is. Then, there's poaching, with players able to do crime, sneaking into wildlife sanctuaries to capture rare Pals that can be sold for cash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrowhead Game Studios has shared more information on the PC version of its satirical sci-fi shooter sequel Helldivers 2 ahead of its PlayStation 5 and PC launch on 8th February, alongside confirmation of crossplay support between platforms.


Helldivers 2 follows the same basic template as its well-received predecessor (which earned a Eurogamer Recommended badge back in 2015), sending players - either working solo or in teams of up to four - on procedurally generated missions across hostile alien worlds to complete objectives, subjugate the locals, and orchestrate their escape. The likes of customisable loadouts and stratagems return in the sequel, but the major difference is a shift from a top-down perspective to third-person one this time around.


And now, Arrowhead has confirmed players across PlayStation 5 and PC will be able to experience all the above together, courtesy of Helldivers 2's crossplay support. "Community and teamwork are the most important pillars of Helldivers 2," it explained, "and so it is essential to ensure players can work together regardless of the system they choose to use. Together we can celebrate victories, mourn losses, and liberate the galaxy without platform boundaries."

Xbox fans rejoiced when Baldur's Gate 3 surprised-launched at the end of last year following an extended delay related to split-screen co-op, but things got off to a bumpy start, with some players soon reporting their saves were being lost after crashing - a frankly horrifying prospect for a title as lengthy and involved as Baldur's Gate 3.


Unfortunately, the issue has continued to persist in the weeks since; Larian recently offered a workaround to help players avoid the save issue, but noted that a permanent fix would require a firmware update from Microsoft, which was still in the works.

This free update is known as Sins of the Flesh, and is coming (no pun intended, but, hey, as it is there anyway let's just roll with it) to platforms on 16th January.


Developer Massive Monster calls the upcoming content its "biggest and most wicked" update yet. It will include new progression systems, which will add more complexity to the gameplay. The Cult of the Lamb team also boasts about the arrival of "shiny poop, baneful brooms, and bigger, better buildings," so plenty to keep an eye out for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 10/01/24: The Apex Legends crossover event with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is live, meaning the cost of event packs is now confirmed.
As per the official Instagram video shared previously, the cost of event packs is 100 coins - reduced from the standard 1000 coins. 
However, the cost of packs actually increases depending on the number of items owned, as per the screenshot below. If players own 16 to 35 items, the cost of packs increases back to 1000 coins. It means if players want to own all 36 items (including the death box), it won't cost the full £360 but they'll still need to shell out a considerable amount.

The event begins later today in celebration of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth arriving next month, and includes a number of themed items, skins, and events. 


This is the first in-game crossover of its kind in Apex Legends and the potential cost of items is eye-watering for fans. On social media, the high cost has sparked fury in the game's community, although this is based on the current cost of packs that could be reduced once the event launches.

The situation highlights the fact that if you do want to go watch the Pokémon series in order, you'll need access to multiple streaming services and a couple of paid subscriptions.

Admittedly, that in itself isn't all that remarkable, but what makes this little stunt more interesting is that the car was being controlled by a PlayStation DualSense controller.


During a segment hosted by Honda's president Toshihiro Mibe talking about the car manufacturer's work with Sony, the exec spoke about "the joy of expanding life's potential". 
Its vision expands beyond just your regular cars and motorcycles, with talk of the sky, ocean and outer space being shared. Sony's technologies will help Honda expand its "field of mobility", the company president explained. Then, the president and COO of Sony Honda Mobility Inc Izumi Kawanishi joined his colleague on the stage, and this is where we head into video game territory.

Around five seconds of footage, including a behind-the-scenes motion capture shot, can be glimpsed in the video below - it shows a blonde-haired character leaping from a rooftop, then soaring down through the buildings of a floating city.


At the end of the clip, the character then flies towards what looks like a red, dragon-like beastie. All of this takes place in rather realistic-like surroundings - a far cry from the anime-inspired visuals of the original games. Intriguing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has announced a further round of layoffs, less than two months after its previous job cuts, that'll see it eliminate roughly 25 percent of its total workforce - around 1,800 employees - as part of the "company reset" it unveiled at the end of last year.


Unity confirmed additional layoffs at the company were "likely" back in November, when it revealed it was assessing its portfolio "to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers". Shortly after, it announced it was ending its agreement with Weta FX, resulting in the loss of 265 jobs - the company's fourth round of layoffs since the start of 2022.


A fresh round of layoffs at Unity - the largest ever at the company - has now been confirmed in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. This time, around 1,800 employees will be affected, with the company saying the cuts come as it "restructures and refocuses on its core business" and seeks to "position itself for long-term and profitable growth."

Word Baldur's Gate 3 players were receiving bans for using an Xbox-approved feature with an Xbox-approved game (albeit in a way potentially violating Microsoft policy) surfaced last week, and developer Larian quickly moved to assure fans it was working with Microsoft to sort out the "annoying and uncool" suspensions. Shortly after it said affected parties should start seeing their bans lifted, and that "Work is ongoing, and the Microsoft team is aware of the issue!".


A week on and Microsoft itself has now acknowledged the situation in a statement on social media. "To provide clarity on Baldur's Gate 3 mature content enforcement actions," it wrote, "Xbox account suspensions are not automatic. Each clip is reviewed by a moderator and, if found in violation of our safety and content policies, actioned accordingly."

Journalist and prolific leaker Jeff Grubb initially claimed Microsoft had been eyeing up a potential PlayStation and Switch release for Sea of Thieves on his Game Mess podcast earlier today. That was followed by a similar story from former Axios journalist Stephen Totilo, writing on his newly launched Game File website.

Vincke confirmed the studio's next game was in the works last November, saying he "very excited about it", and that Baldur's Gate 3's critical and commercial success was "really encouraging us to ensure it pushes many boundaries".

As with <a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022/">IWORD 2022</a>, the goal was to bring together a diverse set of thinkers and practitioners to talk about how democracy might be reimagined for the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>My thinking is very broad here. Modern democracy was invented in the mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies, it would look very different. Representation would look different. Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation would look different. Everything would look different, because we would have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to worry about...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 9/1/24: Magic: The Gathering maker Wizards of the Coast has issued a statement saying it will work with external vendors to ensure AI-generated artwork is kept out of promotional material for the game. 
The statement follows the recent departure of an artist at the company, who said he had quit in protest at the promotional material.
"Thanks to our diligent community who pointed out a series of recent marketing images may have included elements of generative AI, we are rethinking our process of how we work with vendors for our marketing creative," Wizards of the Coast wrote in a new statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artist Dave Rapoza has quit working for Wizards of the Coast following claims recent promotional material used for Magic: The Gathering was generated using AI tools.
Although Wizards of the Coast refuted accusations that a recent image was generated via AI, fans and artists alike were quick to point out inconsistencies with the image.
The charge is particularly emotive given Wizards of the Coast confirmed last month that it "require[s] artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the Magic TCG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final Magic products".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A remake of the original Metal Gear Solid game is reportedly still in development at Konami.
According to the Spanish website Areajugones – which previously, and correctly, leaked God of War Regnarök's DLC existence ahead of a formal announcement – "Konami is still working on a remake of the first installment, although right now Metal Gear Solid Delta is a priority in the studio".
The website reports that the claim comes from "multiple sources" and suggests that it will only be playable on PS5, not PS4. Similarly, there's been no mention of a PC or Xbox release, either. Given Metal Gear Solid Delta is coming to multiple platforms, though, it stands to reason that the Metal Gear Solid Remake will, too. But all we can do is wait for official confirmation.

Unfortunately there's still no release date for the expansion beyond 'summer 2024'.

As reported by Law360 and spotted by our sister site, GamesIndustry.biz, the complaint includes allegations against former CEO Bobby Kotick for remarks he made at an unspecified leadership conference in which he reportedly said that the "problem" at ABK was that "there are too many old white guys".
The filing – lodged by a 57-year-old white man who worked at the company from 2014 until he was laid off as part of the company's restructure in late 2023 – says that shortly after hearing these comments, a pair of white executives left "based, at least in part, on Kotick's ageist remarks", adding that "Activision placed profits over people by terminating the older, higher-paid executives".

To fully appreciate this tribute, we need to go back a few years. When Baldur's Gate 3 was still in early access, forum user Solfalia messaged Larian to thank the studio for releasing Act I, despite the game not being complete. This release allowed Solfalia to play the game - as it was at the time - with their father, who had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Their father had played other Larian games in the past and was a fan, so this opportunity meant a lot to them both.


"This Early Access means that this Xmas I'll be able to go on an adventure with him one last time, and I know he'll enjoy it," Solfalia wrote in their original post from 2020.

Developer Larian shared an update on X (formerly Twitter) over the weekend, to state work is ongoing to sort these bans. The bans in question saw players being penalised for capturing in-game footage containing nudity, which was then uploaded to Xbox servers.
"Microsoft team is aware of the issue," the developer said. "If you're wanting to upload any clips in the meantime, make sure to turn off mature content."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Larian is working alongside Microsoft to sort out "annoying and uncool" account bans, which can happen when Baldur's Gate 3 footage containing nudity gets uploaded to Xbox servers. 


This all stems back to the weekend, when Reddit user Daddy-Vegas warned other Baldur's Gate 3 players about capturing certain footage in Larian's award-winning RPG. The Redditor recorded "some naked camp time fun", which they planned to share with their brother. Xbox then automatically uploaded the footage to its servers. 


However, if Xbox discovers imagery it deems offensive, the content is removed and the player's profile will be "temporarily prohibited from sharing additional imagery (typically for 24 hours)". And, as Daddy-Vegas' clips included that aforementioned nudity, they were met with a ban for each clip, which resulted in their account being suspended for a year. They have since appealed their ban, with the Redditor revealing earlier this week their efforts were successful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser has denied being involved in a new flash cart project claimed to allow Switch users to play back-ups of their owned games.
The MIG-Switch flash cart, officially, is a "third party back-up and development device for the Nintendo Switch" according to the device website, that's not endorsed nor licenced by Nintendo of Japan. While the idea behind the device is players can back up games they own legally, it also opens the door for piracy and for people to potentially play roms of games they do not own.
However, Bowser - who was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices back in 2022 - said he was "not involved" in any aspect of the MIG-Switch. Rather, the hacker reportedly said he had been the "subject of DNS poisoning attack on [his] nameservers" (thanks, VGC).

In addition, there are two bonus games to enjoy: Moley Christmas (which was originally given away with a magazine.

In a world first, 13-year-old Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson - who is a competitive Tetris player - has managed to get the decades old falling block game to reveal its "kill screen". While not your traditional end of game, with credits or even game over message, this screen essentially sees Tetris crash. This is beating Tetris, a once thought impossible feat. 


The delight shown by the young player, who was born over two decades after the game actually released, as the screen freezes is palpable. "Oh my god," Gibson repeats. "I'm going to pass out, I can't feel my fingers."

Originally titled Infestation 88 and later stylised as '88, the studio has now removed the number entirely from its name. The game, which had its debut trailer earlier this week after the original Steamboat Willie Disney cartoon entered the public domain, is now known as Infestation: Origins.


The studio has since stated the number 88 was originally chosen for its "symmetrical design" and insisted any connection with Neo-Nazi connotations was unintentional.

The dispute between the two companies saw Frogwares attempting to remove The Sinking City from PC storefront Steam in a bid to sever its ties to Nacon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's upcoming open world Star Wars game Outlaws looks to be set for a "late" 2024 release. 


Until today, the Ubisoft game held a much wider ranging 2024 release window. However, a Disney Parks blog post promoting a variety of events and such for the next 12 months has Star Wars Outlaws listed as arriving towards the tail end of the year. 


"Star Wars Outlaws, the open world Star Wars game, is set to release late this year," the post reads (thanks, IGN). "The game lets you explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. You can risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. If you're willing to take the risk, the galaxy is full of opportunity."

The Kingsley siblings co-founded Rebellion, which is best known for the Sniper Elite series, in Oxford all the way back in 1992. Since its conception in the early 90s, the company has since expanded to include comic, book, board game, film and TV work under its umbrella. 


Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley called it an "incredible honour" to be awarded a CBE. "It, in part, reflects the growth and success of Rebellion but also the wider UK games industry. Games are now the leading form of entertainment media," he wrote.

Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley called it an "incredible honour" to be awarded a CBE. "It, in part, reflects the growth and success of Rebellion but also the wider UK games industry. Games are now the leading form of entertainment media," he wrote.

Called Infestation 88, this upcoming release is following in similar footsteps of slasher film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey and the horrifying Winnie's Hole, and the more directly Steamboat Willie-inspired first-person shooter, Mouse, announced last year. This time, developer Nightmare Forge Games has taken an innocent and beloved children's character and given it a sinister makeover.

"As players traverse whimsical worlds, they interact with characters and engage in turn-/puzzle-based combat against paper creatures.

"This is an adventure role-playing game in which players help Mario rescue Princess Peach from an alien group," the website says. "As players traverse whimsical worlds, they interact with characters and engage in turn-/puzzle-based combat against paper creatures.

Video game researcher Kurakasis took to Twitter/X earlier today to detail "everything" they know to date about the upcoming game, including a rumour that it will be an "MMORPG to be precise". They also shared details of job listings that seem to confirm the game in development may be called "Land of Salvation".

"The game is now essentially confirmed to be in development, as an NCSoft employee posted a job listing on LinkedIn with a codename logo stylised similarly to the logo of Horizon games," Kurakasis said. "It's developed under the codename Project Skyline, with the initial codename being Project H."

The slide – which notably excludes other Sony first-party titles, including Naughty Dog's The Last of Us series and Horizon Zero Dawn's sequel, Horizon Forbidden West – reveals the sale figures for several games released since 2017, including Marvel's Spider-Man (2018), God of War (2018), and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020), which have sold 18.9 million, 15.9 million, and 12.6 million copies in their first two years, respectively. 

The same table, if true, also reveals that Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) sold 11 million copies, Gran Turismo Sport (2017) 7.8 million, Days Gone (2019) 7 million, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (2021) 3.9 million, and "Ghost Dir Cut" – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut (2021) – 3.3 million copies.

<blockquote><p>When Stolen Device Protection is turned on, Face ID or Touch ID authentication is required for additional actions, including viewing passwords or passkeys stored in iCloud Keychain, applying for a new Apple Card, turning off Lost Mode, erasing all content and settings, using payment methods saved in Safari, and more. No passcode fallback is available in the event that the user is unable to complete Face ID or Touch ID authentication.</p>
<p>For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple said there will be no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>
