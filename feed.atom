Kubernetes v1.22, released in August 2021, introduced a new alpha feature that improves how Linux nodes implement memory resource requests and limits.

Since its arrival on Switch back in March, Capcom has released a steady flow of post-launch content for Monster Hunter Rise, ranging from the big stuff - which is to say new creatures and a proper conclusion to the Kamura Village story arc - to fun smaller additions, including a series of 'collaborations' based on various video game properties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox boss Phil Spencer has written to staff saying he is "evaluating all aspects" of Xbox's relationship with Activision Blizzard in light of a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming Activision CEO Bobby Kotick had known about alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment within his company for years, but had failed to fully act upon them.
In an email seen by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier - and later confirmed by Microsoft in a statement to IGN - Spencer told Xbox employees he and the gaming leadership team were "disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions" at Activision Blizzard, and that "this type of behaviour has no place in our industry".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ninja Theory's acclaimed 2017 action-adventure, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, has just received a new update, bringing August's Xbox Series X enhancements over to PC. Additionally, a range of new accessibility features have been introduced to both versions.
The official description for Hellblade's PC enhancements is a little vague, with Ninja Theory only promising "enriched visuals", alongside DirectX Raytracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and AMD FSR support. However, the new PC release will almost certainly reflect the Xbox Series X version, which introduced the likes of upgraded materials, particles, and draw distances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sifu, the striking martial arts adventure from Absolver developer Sloclap, will be making its way to PlayStation and PC a little sooner than expected. Its arrival date has been revised to 8th February, a few weeks earlier than its originally anticipated 22nd February release.
Announcing the revised launch, Absolver explained it wanted to get Sifu into players hands a little sooner so they "can enjoy playing [it] ahead of an incredibly big month for highly anticipated AAA releases". If Sifu had stuck to its original release date it would have been jostling up against the likes of Destiny 2's The Witch Queen expansion, Horizon: Forbidden West, and the mighty Elden Ring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Mojang has announced that the long-awaited second part of Minecraft's ambitious Caves & Cliffs update will finally launch on 30th November for the Java and Bedrock editions of the game - meaning it'll be coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4,  Switch, iOS, Android, Windows 10, Windows 11, MacOS, and Linux.
Minecraft's Caves & Cliffs update, you may recall, was initially unveiled during last October's Minecon, with Mojang promising the likes of new cave types - complete with fresh blocks, mobs, and items - underground lakes and waterfalls to raft down, a new archaeology system, and, above ground, significantly more mountainous cliffs, complete with goats.

Inspired by Steve Purcell's cult comic series and first released in 2007, Beyond Time and Space once against follows the largely ludicrous adventures of crime-fighting dog and bunny duo Sam & Max - who both made their video game debut 15 years earlier in LucasArts' point-and-click classic Sam & Max Hit the Road - over the course of five episodes.

Eligible users should look for the cloud icon on supported titles in their console's Game Pass catalogue. If present, a cloud version of the game can be launched for immediate play - perhaps to sample its wares or to quickly join a friend's gaming session - without needing to download it first. Microsoft calls it a "great way to discover your next favourite game while saving space on your hard drive for the games you plan to play again and again."

After the mark is convinced, the scammer will have them get cash (sometimes out of investment or retirement accounts), and head to an ATM that sells cryptocurrencies and supports reading QR codes. Once the victim’s there, they’ll scan a QR code that the scammer sent them, which will tell the machine to send any crypto purchased to the scammer’s address.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I was creating a new account on the web. It was financial in nature, which means it gets one of my most secure passwords. I used <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/">PasswordSafe</a> to generate this 16-character alphanumeric password:</p>
<pre><code>:s^Twd.J;3hzg=Q~
</code></pre>
<p>Which was rejected by the site, because it didn&#8217;t meet their password security rules.</p>
<p>It took me a minute to figure out what was wrong with it. They wanted at least two numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html">Sheesh</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, that&#8217;s not really why I don&#8217;t like password rules. I don&#8217;t like them because they&#8217;re all different. If someone has a strong password generation system, it is likely that whatever they come up with won&#8217;t pass somebody&#8217;s ruleset...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battlefield is used to a bit of chaos - it's at the series' core, after all, with manic moments in its sandbox what makes it stand out from other shooters - but the disarray of Battlefield 2042's first weekend in the wilds has been hugely frustrating. Since Battlefield 2042 went live on Friday, I've endured hard crashes, server problems and whole nights where the whole thing is simply unplayable. This is another Battlefield that's launching in a sorry state, and it's up there with Battlefield 4's infamously sorry start. From my own experience on Xbox Series X, it's considerably worse. 
A lot of that frustration stems from setting aside Friday night to get stuck into DICE's new shooter only to spend the whole evening butting up against a data persistent error that was, shall we say, persistent - across a whole night it was impossible to get into a single match of the All-Out Warfare that's the core of this new Battlefield experience, and only the classic matches and rulesets of Portal offered any joy.

It was fab and much-missed, and if a new report is to be believed, is now "definitely" set to make a a comeback.

Those that successfully managed to surmount some early technical hitches and join the front of the queue when Steam Deck reservations opened back in July were originally due to receive their hardware in December this year.

<p>The two exploits are particularly notable due to the level of access they theoretically give to the PS5’s software.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As one of Bethesda's biggest and most beloved series, it's not much of a revelation to hear the company is already mulling over a new Fallout instalment, but studio director Todd Howard has now talked a little about a potential new series entry, confirming that while an idea exists, Fallout 5 is still a long way off.
Speaking to IGN as part of a Skyrim 10th anniversary retrospective, Howard explained that currently the studio has a "one-pager" for Fallout 5, outlining what it wants to do with the series. However, sci-fi adventure Starfield, due to release next year, and The Elder Scrolls 6 - which was still in its design phase as of June this year - remain the studio's priority, meaning it could be years before work on the next Fallout begins in earnest.

The user/group ID related security settings in Pod's securityContext trigger a problem when users want to
deploy containers that use accelerator devices (via Kubernetes Device Plugins) on Linux. In this blog

We already knew it was going to be a big one, of course, but we now have a much clearer idea of just how big it actually is, with data miners having successfully unearthed and catalogued a whopping 9,000+ new items as part of the update.
Granted, a fair few of those items - as datamined by NWPlayer123, Trundler, and VillagerDB, and shared by AnimalCrossingWorld - are colour variations, but even taking those into account, it's still a mammoth set of additions, covering clothing items, furniture, a multitude of different light fixtures, cooking apparatus, and more.

Crystal Dynamics eventually moved to reassure fans that Spidey was still coming but his exact arrival date remained unclear - until now.

Last year's Mafia: Definitive Edition is, of course, the fancied up version of Illusion Softworks' fondly remembered open-world mobster game from 2002.

One particularly pernicious method uses Unicode directionality override characters to display code as an anagram of its true logic.
