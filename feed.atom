        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis, the standalone-expansion-style next instalment in Sega's long-running free-to-play online action-RPG series, will - following its beta last month - be making its way to Xbox and PC next Wednesday, 9th June.
Announced last summer, New Genesis is described as the "next-generation" of Phantasy Star Online 2, and catapults the action forward 1,000 years after the Oracle's battle in PSO2.
Bundled alongside the base game, it includes a new graphics engine, enhanced character models, a new multi-weapon system, and, most notably, a "wide-open battlefield" with changing time and weather, traversable using new abilities like the Photon Dash and Photon Glide. There's also cross-platform play, plus fully localised text and character voices in English.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All three episodes of Life is Strange developer Dontnod's well-received supernatural mystery adventure Tell Me Why are currently free on PC and Xbox.
Tell Me Why, if you're unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the picturesque Alaskan town of Delos Crossing - a task that ultimately forces them to confront their traumatic past.
What follows is a deft blend of supernatural mystery thriller and earnest, character-driven homecoming drama - there's real beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists - that's arguably Dontnod's most assured, consistently enjoyable outing yet, even if its perhaps not quite as devastatingly memorable as its Life is Strange forebears.

"However, when Alba finds out about plans to build a garish hotel on the site of the island's nature reserve," explains UsTwo, "she sets out to stop it!"

That's according to a single, and only mildly informative, slide found within publisher 505 Games' latest fiscal year financial results presentation (as spotted by Gematsu) - which, as well as noting that Bloodstained has now sold more than 1m copies, amassing over €30m in sales, confirms a "second version" is currently in development.
As Gematsu points out, "second version", although a somewhat unusual turn of phrase in this context, appears throughout the presentation in conjunction with other properties that have confirmed sequels, such as One More Level's action-parkour game Ghostrunner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UK chain GAME has launched an eye-catching offer to get Xbox Series S for less than £100 when you trade-in a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.
But, tellingly, GAME's terms and conditions for this offer make it clear that this is only open to the public - and not to "trade" resellers looking for a quick profit.
"GAME reserves the right to refuse any offer to anyone believed to be representing a trade buyer/customer," the chain states. In other words, if you manage a CEX, no telling your staff to go upgrade dozens of knackered Xbox Ones for Series S to just resell the newer consoles for profit. This may well apply if you're an organised scalper, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hardly the biggest discount of all time - Among Us is currently £3.99 on Steam and completely free on iOS and Android - but if you've been thinking about dipping a toe into Among Us on PC, you can now do so for free via the Epic Games Store. 
The social deduction game, which originally released in 2018 but became enormously popular during the lockdowns of 2020, is free as part of Epic's ongoing Mega Sale (which lasts until 17th June). Those who have an Epic Games Store account can grab Among Us for free until 3rd June.
Once you've claimed the free game, you'll have access to new map The Airship, and be able to play with friends on other platforms like Switch, Android and iOS. The game is due to arrive on PlayStation later this year, too, so hopefully there won't be any problems with cross-play there.

Relic's superb World War 2 real-time strategy game and its standalone single-player campaign are free to download and keep via Steam now until 3rd June 2021.
2013's Company of Heroes 2 is widely regarded as one of the best RTS games around. "While Company of Heroes 2 sometimes makes you feel like you're fighting the game as well as the enemy, if you take time to understand the systems at work beneath the carnage and pick and choose your battles wisely, you will ultimately be rewarded by a deep and enjoyable RTS," wrote Stace Harman in Eurogamer's Company of Heroes 2 review.

Amatangelo joined CD Projekt back in January 2020, and will now take over from former game director Adam Badowski. According to a report by GamesIndustry.biz, Badowski will now focus on other leadership duties within CD Projekt, including the company's new "strategic development framework" that will see the Cyberpunk and Witcher brands developed in parallel. 
Before becoming a creative director for Cyberpunk 2077, Amatangelo also worked as a design director on Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC, and lead designer on several expansions for Star Wars: The Old Republic. Cyberpunk 2077's roadmap indicates that we should see several free DLCs for the game over the next year, and Amatangelo certainly has some experience in this area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as it promised, Sony has pulled back the veil on Guerrilla Games' highly anticipated Horizon Forbidden West, sharing 14 minutes of gorgeous gameplay running on PlayStation 5.
As you can see in the video below, it's an immediate feast for the eyes, beginning as Aloy scrambles through dense jungle foliage before stumbling out onto a oceanside settlement, all sandy beaches, deep blue water, and vast rock spires on the horizon, shrouded in clouds. These, Guerrilla later confirms, are the remnants of San Francisco, millennia into the future, and it's here that Aloy encounters machine-riding raiders, immediately embarking on some nimble combat, firing arrows and hurtling acrobatically around the environment to escape their attack.
This initial sequence ends beneath the waves as Aloy swims through gorgeous coral reefs, kelp, and exotic fauna, fighting the current as she goes. Eventually she reaches dry land and encounters the raiders once more, this time choosing to take a more stealthy approach as she attempts to liberate her kidnapped friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Techland's parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel, Dying Light 2, has - after a rather tumultuous few years of development - finally received a release date. It'll be coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 7th December, and Techland has released a brand-new gameplay trailer to accompany the news.
Dying Light 2 is set 20 years after the events of the first game, in a world devastated by a mutated version of the original virus. With over 98% of the population now lost, the remnants of humanity have congregated in the sprawling metropolis of Villedor, also known as The City, and it's here that new protagonist Aiden Caldwell finds himself while searching for his family.
To date, Techland has really only painted the ensuing adventure in broad strokes, talking up key points such as Dying Light 2's 2-4 player co-op, its returning day and night cycle, and its focus on choice and consequence. Today's developer livestream didn't go too much further than those core concepts, but did flesh them out with a few additional details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic's 30th anniversary livestream has come and gone, leaving a big blue streak in its wake, and while it wasn't perhaps the most revelatory of showings, Sega did at least confirm the previously rumoured Sonic Colors remaster and retro Sonic collection - as well as providing the tiniest teases of Sonic's next major game.
Starting with the remaster, it's called Sonic Colors Ultimate and will be heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (exclusively via the Epic Games Store) on 7th September this year.
As those who've played the 2010 original will know, Sonic Colors transports the iconic mascot to Dr. Robotnik's interstellar theme park for a familiar blend of appropriately high-speed into-the-screen and side-on platforming, with the hedgehog able to access handy new skills, such as a speed boost or the ability to drill underground, thanks to friendly Wisps.

Our first look at polished Aragami 2 gameplay lies in the new trailer below, which shows a new threat for the Rashomon Valley and various ninja-inspired fights.
The original Aragami sold 700k copies and helped grow Lince Works as a studio, the developer said in a release today, meaning Aragami 2 is now the work of a more experienced and larger team. Combat has been overhauled, and looks sneakier than ever. Here's a peek:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has said PlayStation cross-platform support has been cut from an upcoming Borderlands 3 patch - though without explaining why. 
In a tweet sent this afternoon, Pitchford said that while a Borderlands 3 update had been prepared for release "that includes full crossplay support across all platforms", PlayStation will ultimately not be included.
Pitchford did not detail why, upon submitting the patch for certification, Gearbox was then forced to remove crossplay by the game's publisher 2K. Did Sony suddenly decide to take issue with the game's long-promised crossplay becoming a reality? Or did Gearbox and/or 2K decide not to play by Sony's rules? Pitchford has so far chosen not to elaborate.

It's penned by PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, and includes a number of interesting bits of information that reveal Sony's masterplan for its money-printing video games business.
At the beginning, Sony mentions it's "building our biggest-ever platform" with PlayStation 5, and that it's working to ensure "our longest-ever tail" with the PS4. PS5 has delivered PlayStation's highest-ever launch sales, with 7.8m units sold as of the end of Sony's last financial year (ending March 2021).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's long-awaited Switch upgrade is expected to be shown ahead of E3 2021, according to a report published by Bloomberg [paywall] today and Eurogamer's own sources.
I understand this is to ensure third-parties working on games which support the upgraded Switch are free to announce these projects at E3, and before Nintendo's own digital showcase later in that week. 
(Nintendo's event has yet to be formally dated but is currently set to slot in after other publishers towards the end of E3, though of course dates can still shift.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Quest celebrated its 35th anniversary in some style in the early hours of this morning, with a livestream from Japan heralding the announcement of a string of new entries and spin-offs for the much-loved RPG series.
Heading the lot was Dragon Quest 12, which will be the first mainline entry since 2017. Not much was shown beyond a brief trailer revealing a logo - though that logo did reveal a turn towards dark fantasy, and what series' creator dubbed a Dragon Quest 'for adults'. It's being primed for a simultaneous worldwide release - in what would be a first for a mainline entry - though the timing has yet to be revealed, while no platforms have been announced just yet. 
Elsewhere, a remake of Dragon Quest 3 was announced, taking on the 2D/3D stylings of the likes of Octopath Traveler - and being ushered into existence by Octopath Traveler producer Masaaki Hayasaka. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D, as it's somewhat clumsily called at present, again has no release date or confirmed platforms, though it is also slated for a worldwide simultaneous release and we were afforded a look at it in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a little over two weeks away from this year's attempt at an online-only E3, meaning everyone'll soon be sinking into the familiar swamp of showcase schedules and diary dates required to keep track of the event and everything around it. Wisely starting early to avoid the ensuing scramble, though, Microsoft has announced a 13th June air date for this year's E3-adjacent Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase.
It'll be a significant event for a number of reasons, not least because it's the first joint announcement show for the two companies following Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda last year, and things kick off at 10am PT on Sunday, 13th June - which, for us UK folk, equates to an entirely tolerable 6pm in the afternoon. It's a long one too, with Microsoft promising 90-minutes of announcements - hopefully that's a taut 90 minutes with none of the waffly filler it usually loves to pad out its livestreams with (hello Inside Xbox, I'm looking at you).
As you'd expect, there's little in the way of specific regarding the games we'll be seeing - all the better to retain that all-important element of surprise - and Microsoft is merely teasing a look at the "epic gaming lineup coming out of [the Bethesda] partnership, the incredible games coming to Xbox this holiday, upcoming releases on Xbox Game Pass, and more."

Last year's real-world BlizzCon was cancelled due to coronavirus-related "health and safety considerations", and its long-awaited digital-only replacement - formally titled BlizzConline - eventually took place in February this year. Since then, it's been unclear if Blizzard was still planning to press ahead with a proper large-scale physical gathering in 2021, perhaps around the early November weekend usually reserved for its BlizzCon shows.
In a new post on the BlizzCon website, however, show executive producer Saralyn Smith has now confirmed the 2021 event will not be going ahead.

Smith - whose other notable video game roles have included Ezio Auditore da Firenze in the Assassin's Creed series, Chris Redfield in the Resident Evil series, Batman in Batman: Arkham Oranges, and Mirage in Apex Legends - had voiced Sonic since 2010, even lending his vocal talents to the character in the Wreck-it-Ralph films.
However, back in January, Smith tweeted, "Welp, 10 years was an amazing run. Onward to new zones!", alongside an image of a broken blue heart. Sega later confirmed what fans had already suspected, announcing Smith's departure from the Sonic role.

An officially-licensed compilation of 18 Olympic sport mini-games, it will launch for PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Stadia and Xbox.
Of course, it's unsurprising Sega has left this news until so late. While the real-world Olympics are (currently) set to go ahead in July, a year later than originally planned, the debate continues on whether it is right to hold the games at all while many countries - not least its host, Japan - continue to struggle with the impacts of coronavirus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's normally a bit of tuning work to be done when a new legend is introduced to Apex Legends, and jetpack-wielding hero Valkyrie is no exception. Some of her flights are lasting a little longer than Respawn would like, it seems, and the developer has decided to clip her wings. 
As explained by associate live balance designer John Larson, players figured out that hovering with Valkyrie's jetpack currently costs very little fuel - and were using this to "take coffee breaks above the final fight in scrims". It reminds me a bit of when Fortnite players used planes to stay out of battles until the very last moment. 
In any case, the 10 percent fuel cost for hovering is now being removed entirely, and from Thursday onwards it will cost you the full 100 percent to hang around in the air. When asked why it was being removed rather than nerfed, Larson said that Respawn experimented with a 50-75 percent fuel cost, but found that this "didn't feel meaningfully different and still allowed Valk to stay airborne for too long in certain final rings.

And now there seems to be a western-themed PUBG game codenamed Project Cowboy on the way. 
South Korean media outlet Bloter spotted job adverts on Krafton's website for an "open-world shooting game" that will release on console and PC as an independent title (via Google Translate). Krafton apparently told Bloter that "Project Cowboy is a new IP game for Battleground developed by Krafton". PUBG dataminer PlayerIGN described it as "PUBG's western custom mode" with "old west guns only".   
Eurogamer contacted Krafton for comment, and was told the company has "nothing to share on Project Cowboy as of now".

Crimson Glow Valstrax, if the name sounds familiar, is a new variant of the Elder Dragon first introduced in Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, making its Rise debut with a new form and attacks. The beast is able to change the shape of it wings, notes Capcom, enabling it to fly freely through the sky and survive at unusually high altitudes.
As for the Apex Zinogre, it's a tougher version of the familiar Monster Hunter staple already in Rise, and features a striking new look with its golden fur and lightning. Capcom says it'll make an appearance in Rampage quests but can be tackled as part of a standard quest too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We knew the upcoming Pokémon games set in the Sinnoh region would arrive sometime later this year, but we now have a set date for Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl: 19th November 2021. 
The new games for Switch were announced back in February, and are essentially retro-style remakes of the original Diamond and Pearl games. In the overworld characters take on a chibi art style, but there are also full-size Pokémon battles. 
Another Sinnoh game arrives early next year, called Pokémon Legends Arceus, which sees players explore a more feudal version of the region with old school pokéballs - and you'll be tasked with creating the first ever Pokédex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's right, PUBG is getting another batch of fresh maps this year, as the dev team has unveiled its 2021 dev plan - and it includes two brand new locations along with a remaster for Miramar.
The first of these changes is the upcoming Miramar remaster, which is being rolled out in patch 12.1 (now live on PC test servers). Miramar has been tweaked and revamped before, but this time it's getting a "much larger remastering", using the technology used to improve other maps like Sanhok to tweak the "lighting, performance, graphical fidelity, topography, and of course special features". 
Players can also expect to find "overhauls to terrain and building textures and layouts, easier traversal with the removal of unnecessary obstacles, and even updated cliffs to better fit in the more vertical experience the game has become". PUBG Corp provided a helpful before and after so you can see exactly what the improvements will look like:

Today's patch makes two tiny changes to fix tournament points and match history from being reset. But it has also, again, sparked discussion among players wondering if a more significant update will ever follow.
Released back in 2017, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is Nintendo Switch's best-selling game. Four years on, it continues to sell extremely well and has a near-permanent spot in the UK boxed game chart top 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve is reportedly readying to enter the hardware market once more, this time with a new "Switch-like" handheld gaming PC that could potentially launch by the end of the year.
That's according to a report by Ars Technica, which expands on the recent discovery of a new hardware-related code - referring to a mysterious device known as "SteamPal" - in the latest version of Steam. Citing "multiple sources familiar with the matter", Ars Technica claims this device (whose final name remains unconfirmed) is a new Valve-developed all-in-one portable gaming PC that features gamepad controls and a touchscreen in a similar form factor to Nintendo's Switch, albeit without detachable controllers.
SteamPal, or whatever it ends up being called (obviously, not calling it the Gabe Boy would be a serious missed opportunity), is reportedly designed to run a large number of games on the Steam PC platform via Linux, and can "dock" to a monitor via its USB Type-C port.

Trufflepigs is the work of Crawshaw's Leeds-based studio Thunkd (which says it wants to become synonymous with "high-quality, short-form, 'evening-sized' games"), and tells the story of Adam - voiced by Doctor Who and Legends of Tomorrow's Arthur Darvill - as he returns to his childhood home in the heart of the English countryside.
What follows is a game of laid-back metal detecting and exploration with a "strong interpersonal narrative" as Adam reunites with old friend Beth (played by Safe House and Another Eden's Luci Fish) and joins her on a quest to find a local treasure connected to her past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axiom Verge 2, the sequel to developer Thomas Happ's acclaimed retro-styled Metroid-a-like, is delayed again, and is now expected to launch in the latter half of this year.
Happ had initially planned to launch Axiom Verge 2 on PC and Switch at some point in 2020, but ultimately opted to postpone release into the first half of this year for a variety of reasons. That window was later narrowed to "spring", but the developer has now announced an additional delay, pushing the game's release back to "Q3" 2021 - indicating it'll likely arrive between the start of July and the end of September.
"I could go into a long spiel about why it's taking longer than I originally forecast," Happ wrote in a post on his blog, "but I don't want to get too bogged down into technical details. Suffice it to say that the game will be better for the additional time, and I won't have to burn myself out crunching to hit a date that I set for myself."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wondering what Sonic's been up to lately? Well, it looks like Sega's poised to reveal all in a 30th anniversary livestream for the prickly blue icon, scheduled to take place this Thursday.
Sonic Central, as Sega's calling its digital showcase, gets underway at 5pm BST/9am PT this Thursday, 27th May, and promises a first look at a number of upcoming "projects, partnerships, and events" the company has been working on as part of its anniversary celebrations.
There's no hint as to what those might be as yet, but recent rumours have suggested Sega is prepping both a new collection of classic Sonic titles and a remaster of the hedgehog's 2010 outing Sonic Colors. Perhaps we'll also finally get a glimpse of Sonic's next major new game, which was confirmed to be in production back in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a busy day for developer Ion Lands; not only is its gorgeous Blade Runner-esque delivery thriller Cloudpunk's "sequel-sized" paid DLC, City of Ghosts, now available on PC, the studio has announced a new cyberpunk-themed life-sim spin-off too.
City of Angels, which seems as good a place as any to start, offers a brand-new, fully voiced story campaign that serves as a direct sequel to the original game. Main protagonist Rania and canine companion Camus return for another skyhigh HOVA-based jaunt around the neon-drenched metropolis of Nivalis, but this time there's a new hero - deadbeat gambler Hayse - with players switching between two interlinking stories as the adventure unfolds.
Ion Worlds says City of Angels is longer than the original story, as well as "darker, tenser, more complex", and promises new areas to explore, new characters and mysteries, HOVA customisation, street racing, and different endings depending on player choices. It's out now on Steam for £12.99/$14.99 USD, and there's a 10% launch day discount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember bird dating sim Hatoful Boyfriend? It's hard to forget, to be honest, but if you haven't yet bought it on iOS, Android or the PlayStation Store then your time is limited, as the game is being delisted from these platforms at the end of May. 
Manga artist and Hatoful Boyfriend creator Hato Moa announced the news on her Twitter account earlier this week, explaining that both Hatoful Boyfriend and its seasonal sequel Holiday Star will no longer be purchasable on these platforms as "publishing agreements on those platforms are coming to an end". Those who already bought the games through these platforms will still be able to use them, however, while the games will remain on sale via Steam. 
If you missed it the first time around, well, Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel about dating birds that was released back in 2014. I guess you can say it's been out for aviary long time. You play as the only human student accepted into a school for birds, where you must navigate classes and build relationships with talking birds. It's all pretty eccentric, but the game earned itself a cult following and critical acclaim for the quality of its character writing.

This morning, Fortnite received update 16.50, the last patch expected before its next season on 7th June. Eagle-eyed fans immediately noticed several changes around the island: a crashed helicopter near the dam, posters showing UFOs and friendly aliens at the beach, and flattened corn at the farm. 
3pm UK time today brought a new set of "Foreshadowing" challenges live, where you're asked to investigate that helicopter, as well as a series of smashed telescopes on the island. Does someone not want its inhabitants looking at the skies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A much-requested feature has finally been introduced to Apex Legends' Arenas mode, as the 3v3 team deathmatches now have a leaving penalty - something that should hopefully deter players from flaking on their squadmates. 
Several changes were announced via patch notes posted on Twitter, including the new abandon penalty for Arenas games. Respawn explained that this is similar to the penalty for Ranked Battle Royale games, and will apply to those who leave a full squad in the middle of a match. 
Unfortunately it seems a couple of people are currently getting unfairly punished by the new penalty, with some reporting being slapped with 10-minute sin bins for leaving during the end screen animations. Director of communications Ryan K. Rigney assured one player that the team was investigating the problem.

The gameplay, which you can see in the video below, is narrated by game director Jeff Lydell and design director Ian Christy from developer Gasket Games. We see a small group of Stormcast Eternals during a mid-to-late battle of the campaign against a modest Nighthaunt army.
The Stormcast Eternals' numbers are few, so Lydell makes smart use of his units' skills as well as knowledge of the environment (pushback, high ground bonuses, lethal hazards etc) to win the assasination mission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an agonisingly long hiatus Sega's much-loved fighting series Virtua Fighter is back, with a remaster of the most recent game coming to PlayStation 4 next month. 
Virtua Fighter: Ultimate Showdown looks to be a remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, the last installment which hit arcades way back in 2010. Final Showdown was itself the last iteration of Virtua Fighter 5, folding in new characters Taka-Arashi and Jean Kujo as well as introducing a more athletic moveset for its cast. We wrote some nice things about it in our Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown review upon its console launch in 2012. 
Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown saw the series bow out at its peak, although it's been kept alive in some way via appearances in the arcades of Sega's hugely successful Yakuza games. Is this the mark of a grand return for Virtua Fighter? The trailer - exclusively hosted on IGN - suggests perhaps not, declaring that the ultimate 3D fighter is back for the final round, with this remaster coinciding with Sega's ongoing 60th anniversary celebrations. Still, there remains hope and it's a delight to see the series back in any form.

Yes, the Epic Games v Apple antitrust trial has now concluded, and after three weeks of remarkable discussions the decision over who won rests with a federal judge.
The trial wrapped up yesterday with some closing remarks from both parties, with Epic reiterating that the case would have an impact on the wider mobile games market and other developers (via GamesIndustry.biz). 
"Epic acknowledges that this is an important case, that there's an important set of conduct, and that a remedy... of the sort that Epic has requested would be important and significant," said Epic's counsel Gary Bornstein. "But that is because the issue affects such a large number of consumers, such a large number of developers, and has persisted for such a long period of time."

This made sorting which eggs to hatch much easier, as it was now clear which were from specific events, and it was also a welcome first step to indicating the likelihood of getting a specific creature, something fans have been loudly calling out for over the past few years.
Now, with weeks of data to test, a group of more than 50 hardcore players at top fan community The Silph Road has analysed thousands of egg hatches to see how well the tier system matches up to reality - and there are some surprising findings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mini Motorways, the acclaimed road-building strategy sim from developer Dinosaur Polo Club, is coming to PC and Mac via Steam on 20th July, with a Switch release to follow early next year.
If you weren't already aware, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club's equally excellent underground railway builder Mini Metro, and, despite its shift in focus, takes a similarly minimalist approach to its tactile strategy action.
This time around, your goal is to construct an efficient road network - traffic lights, bridges, motorways, and all - to ensure commuters can travel from their home to their (same-coloured) destination before the timer runs out. New building items are awarded each in-game week so your ceaseless march of urban expansion may continue, and just like in Mini Metro, things can quickly become as fraught as they are soothingly low-key.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Truck Simulator now has official - albeit experimental - multiplayer support, courtesy of developer SCS Software's latest open beta build, meaning digital truckers need truck the lonely trucking life no more.
Official multiplayer support, which SCS is calling Convoy for self-explanatory reasons, is available now as part of American Truck Simulator's experimental beta update 1.41, and will be making its way to Euro Truck Simulator 2 at a later date.
Once installed, this initial work-in-progress version of Convoy will enable players to set-up and host their own private multiplayer session for up to eight trucking pals. Everyone in a session will see synchronised time, weather, and AI traffic - as well as their trucking buddies' paint jobs and truck accessories - and can undertake the same contracts from the same companies, all heading to the same destination. In-game communication options, if you need them, include CB radio broadcast, quick replies, and text chat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amanita Design has given its much-loved point-and-click space adventure Samorost a surprise spruce-up in the form of a free new 'enhanced' edition release on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.
Samorost, which originally released in 2003, serves up an engaging, if brisk, blend of point-and-click puzzling and toy-like tinkering as players follow the delightfully surreal interplanetary adventures of an adorable space gnome.
Samorost has been free to play via web browser for quite some time, but it's now available as a free downloadable game on iOS and Android, as well as on PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io - meaning all three currently released Samorost titles (the latter two being more substantial paid offerings) are now accessible on the aforementioned storefronts for your amusement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has released a lengthy statement meant to lay out the progress he says his company has made since last summer's devastating reports of sexual harassment and toxic working environments within various teams across the business.
The post, published to Ubisoft's blog, comes in the wake of a French report in Le Télégramme this month that claimed the company had made only minimal changes. Ubisoft rebutted some of that report at the time, while today's statement from the very top of the company doubles down further.
"Last June, we faced the fact that not all team members were experiencing the safe and inclusive workplace that we had always intended Ubisoft to be," Guillemot writes. "Since then, we have engaged in a company-wide effort to listen, learn and build a roadmap for a better Ubisoft for all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix is reportedly collaborating with Nioh developer Team Ninja on an action-focussed Final Fantasy spin-off for PS5 and PC titled Final Fantasy Origins.
Word on the project initially began circulating over the weekend on Reddit and Resetera, and well-connected journalist and former Kinda Funny co-host Imran Khan has now lent further credence to the rumours, citing sources able to corroborate the news in a story on Fanbyte.
Final Fantasy Origins is said to take place "somewhere in or adjacent to the world of the first Final Fantasy game on the NES" and will slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja's own Nioh games and From Software's Souls series - albeit with a more accessible focus to appeal to a wider audience, according to Khan's sources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Street Fighter 2's most enduring myths has finally been proven true 30 years after it began.
The myth is that Street Fighter 2: World Warrior, which launched in 1991, contains a 10-0 matchup between Zangief and E. Honda.
The 10-0 matchup phrase is used by some within the fighting game community to describe a fight between two specific characters where one is so dominant that it always wins in a best of 10 match - no matter what the opponent with the weaker character tries to do.

Some players have complained about the sun glare being so intense in Verdansk '84 that it causes visibility issues. It's particularly problematic when looking outside of a building from the inside, in certain sections of the map.
Responding to an article on Dexerto, Raven Software's lead VFX artist Reed Shingledecker tweeted to say: "I can easily tone it down if needed."

It's the same company that may have outed that Sonic Colors remaster a few weeks back, too.
French site Sogamely boasts no cover art or release date, and right now only lists the game as coming to PS4 "soon". While that can only put this firmly in the take-with-a-giant-bucket-of-salt category, we do know that Sega is currently busy celebrating 30 years of Sonic, so a game collection is certainly a possibility (thanks, VGC). We've reached out to Sega for comment, though, and will update as/when we hear back.

"We had planned to share this next week, but we've heard a lot of you talking and want to make sure the record is clear. Next week we'll be adding 350+ new tags to celebrate yourself and your community," explained a tweet on the official Twitch Twitter account over the weekend.
The new tags - which were drawn up in consultation with "independent, third-party organisations" and "other experts focused on the progress of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, LGBTQIA+, disabled, and marginalized communities" - are "related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, mental health, and more".

Bandai Namco has announced the demo will first land on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on 21st May, with PlayStation 4 and PS5 following on 28th May. There's no news on whether the demo is coming to PC, so we'll have to wait and see if it comes to the platform.

The animated background, named "The Original", is more akin to the loading animation you got when first turning on that chunky console rather than its actual dashboard, but the look will likely still feel familiar.

The montage - which was shared online by streamers hitting back at Leach's derogatory statements - is described as containing "serious personalised intrusive sexism" and shows Leach using sexually explicit and aggressive language as well as personal insults.

Activision even created a website for a fictional air conditioning repair company called Nakatomi Duct Cleaning, offering its services in Verdansk.
The website says "A NAKATOMI CORP DIVISION MASTERING A/C DUCT CLEANING SINCE 1988", but the current Warzone map is set in 1984. Nah... I'm applying too much logic…]]></summary>

Local press reported the strange image on Monday, 3rd May after it popped up overnight - and seemingly had no idea what it was about or who made it.

The re-release of the much-loved 20 year-old action RPG went ahead as planned yesterday on Xbox One, where it costs a pricey £29.99, and PlayStation 4, where for some reason it costs a fiver cheaper at £24.99.
But even though the official Black Isle Studios Twitter page said yesterday that the Switch version would arrive in a couple of hours, the game failed to materialise on the Nintendo eShop.
