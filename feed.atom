        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former EA and Microsoft exec, Peter Moore, says there are "serious questions" to be asked about video game hardware and whether or not there's a future for the traditional home console system.
Moore – who held senior positions at EA, Microsoft, and Sega before leaving gaming altogether to join Liverpool FC in 2017 – reflected on the losses incurred whenever there's a new console generation, suggesting that both "companies and gamers" are asking questions about whether or not players "really need to be spending what could be five, $600 on a bespoke piece of hardware just to play games".
"I think it's a real serious question that's being asked I'm sure in Tokyo, in Redmond, Washington, in Kyoto," Moore told the delightful Wes Yin-Poole at IGN. "That's what everybody's working on right now, because when you start off that next generation, you've got to be ready to absorb billions of dollars in losses.

Pizza Emulators, which distributed  Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators on Android devices, said it made the decision to shut down in order to "prioritise [their] family over the development of my apps".
In a statement posted to the company's Discord community, developer Davide Berra made no reference to Nintendo's settlement with fellow emulation software company Tropical Haze, only confirmed that after "seven incredible years of development and adventures", they had "made the difficult decision to remove them permanently".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake has been rated in Korea.
The highly-anticipated horror game – one of gaming's worst-kept secrets before it was formally revealed back in October 2022 – has been given a mature rating due to, as translated by Google, "excessive violence, excessive blood from hitting and being hit (and there is physical damage such as creatures being separated)", and excessive depictions that some may find fearful and/or disgusting, including "creatures with strangely formed limbs" – a Silent Hill staple, of course.
While the decision was awarded at the end of last month – 29th February, to be precise – there's no intimation on a release date, and both developer Bloober Team and publisher Konami remain taciturn, only willing to commit to a release by the end of the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 45-minute demo of the upcoming PS5 exclusive, Stellar Blade, was added quietly to the PlayStation Store earlier today.
Just half an hour after it went live, however, the free trial – which had not been formally announced or advertised – was mysteriously pulled offline again.
Unfortunately, even those who'd been quick enough to download the demo found themselves locked out once it had been removed from the storefront, intimating that the app had either been published prematurely or had not yet been ready for a playing audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the launch of Sea of Thieves' radical structural overhaul last month, Rare is readying to release a new mid-season update next week that'll add anti-cheat and subscription-free solo play to its swashbuckling pirate adventure. Plus, a big 2024 content preview is on the way as part of Sea of Thieves' sixth anniversary celebrations.


Starting with anti-cheat, Rare has confirmed it'll be introducing Epic's kernel-level Easy Anti-Cheat solution - as used by the likes of Fortnite and Apex Legends - to Sea of Thieves next Thursday, 14th March. There's not much more to report beyond its imminent arrival, but the news'll probably bring some reassurance if you think you've been privy to suspicious behaviour out on the seas. And I'm not talking spyglass dongs.


Additionally, next week's update brings an interesting expansion to last year's Safer Seas mode. From next Thursday onward, it'll be possible for pirates to play alone on a Safer Seas private server without needing a Game Pass Core or Game Pass Ultimate subscription. The key points to note here are that this isn't an offline mode - Sea of Thieves is still intrinsically reliant on its servers - and any form of multiplayer, even in Safer Seas, will still require Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Watch Dogs, Ubisoft's open-world sci-fi hacker series, is reportedly the latest in an ever-growing list of video games to get the live-action movie treatment, with Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde said to be in talks to star.


That's according to Deadline, which reports the Watch Dogs movie will be helmed by director Mathieu Turi (who's currently adapting A Plague Tale for television), working from a screenplay by Christie LeBlanc - the writer behind Netflix's 2021 French sci-fi thriller Oxygen.


The Watch Dogs movie is in development at New Regency Productions but, beyond word of Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde's potential involvement and the rather obvious note from Deadline that it'll be "set within the universe of Ubisoft's" series, details are limited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a little over a month until Amazon's Fallout TV adaptation airs, Prime Video has released another trailer for the series.
It provides our best look yet at the show, with three minutes of footage for us to pore over. And dare I say, it actually looks… decent? To my surprise, I quite liked it?
I've rewatched the trailer several times now to see if there's any new information we can glean hidden in the details, and there are a few things worth pointing out (as well as some references to my all-time favourite in the series, Fallout: New Vegas).

Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths and Mortals was set to go live this morning, UK time, but will now launch at 10pm tonight at the earliest. 


This is due to a last-minute issue discovered during the game's still-ongoing downtime today, which will take at least the rest of the UK day to resolve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo hasn't announced which of its many development studios or partners is making Princess Peach: Showtime, this spring's biggest new Nintendo Switch game, and doesn't seem likely to before it debuts later this month. 


"The development team will be credited in the game credits," a Nintendo spokesperson simply told me today when I enquired which developer had made the game.


There's no reason why Nintendo has to say who has made the game, of course, but fans have said it feels odd that the answer remains a mystery, just a few weeks away from Princess Peach: Showtime!'s 22nd March debut, after press have already played a preview build of the game, and following the launch of this week's public demo.

<blockquote><p>Ignore This Title and HackAPrompt: Exposing Systemic Vulnerabilities of<br />
LLMs through a Global Scale Prompt Hacking Competition</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed in interactive contexts with direct user engagement, such as chatbots and writing assistants. These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for free-form human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking. We also present a comprehensive taxonomical ontology of the types of adversarial prompts...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Reactle was an open-source project created by an individual, the brilliantly-named Chase Wackerfuss, that contained instructions on how to create Wordle spin-offs, such as variations in different languages or themed answers. The code repository is no longer available on Github, following the DMCA takedown notice from the NYT.
"I write to submit a revised DMCA Notice regarding an infringing repository (and hundreds of forked repositories) hosted by Github that instruct users how to infringe The New York Times Co.'s ('The Times') copyright in its immensely popular Wordle game and create knock-off copies of the same," reads the notice, as reported by 404 Media.

In a social media post soon after the update went live, Insomniac said a hotfix was on the way, as using this menu could corrupt saves and players' trophy progress. "There is no risk associated with playing the game as intended," Insomnia said.
However, despite the studio's efforts, this menu was of course accessed, and players have discovered content that was not in the base game, suggesting it was either cut ahead of release, or may be used later for DLC. Please note, potential spoilers lie below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic has revealed the next titles it's giving away on the Epic Games Store, with Deux Ex: Mankind Divided and The Bridge getting the freebie treatment from Thursday, 14th March.


Deux Ex: Mankind Divided is the fifth instalment in Square Enix's stealthy, shooty sci-fi series and a direct sequel to 2012's Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Once again cyber-augmented protagonist Adam Jensen returns, and the ensuing adventure was deemed to be a "smart, handsome and weighty addition to the stealth-action genre" in Eurogamer's review.


As for The Bridge, it's a gravity shifting puzzle game created by Ty Taylor - and described as "Isaac Newton meets M. C. Escher" - that challenges players to manoeuvre the world and reach the exit each stage. Eurogamer quite liked this one on release in 2013, even if it sometimes felt like "the taster course for a more satisfying meal kept frustratingly off the menu."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funcom, developer of the upcoming Dune: Awakening, has issued a statement regarding the role of religion in the game after fan concerns erupted on the internet this week.


In Eurogamer's preview of Dune: Awakening, Funcom chief creative officer Joel Bylos mentioned how "for the large part, we sort of sidestep religion" as part of the game's "alternate history approach" - something which, as we wrote at the time, was likely to initially set Dune nerds' alarm bells ringing. 


But the decision to "sidestep" Dune's overtly religious aspects in Awakening has been taken out of consideration for the series' lore, our Chris Tapsell wrote, and refers to one "religious aspect" in particular. That said, religion is still a theme in the game - something seemingly evident by its focus on the Butlerian jihad: the war between humans and AI.

"THIS IS NOT A DRILL," the Helldivers 2 social media team proclaimed earlier today, stating a recent (fictional) attack has halted all mech output. "Helldivers have been deployed to liberate Tien Kwan!"


Based on this post, it seems like we will soon be sent to Tien Kwan to deal with whatever pest is currently tormenting those poor, sweet, mech factories, and to liberate their metal machines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four years after a live-action Fallout TV adaptation was officially announced, the show is almost upon us. And ahead of its Amazon Video debut on 12th April - and following years of official images, unofficial behind-the-scenes shots, and even a sizeable teaser - we've got our best look yet at the adaptation, courtesy of a new three-minute series trailer.


Going by the trailer below, the adaptation makes a positive first impression, convicingly capturing the Fallout games' ever-shifting tone - blending gee-whizz '50s Americana with grubby post-apocalyptic mayhem as Ella Purnell's Vault Dweller protagonist Jean leaves her lifelong underground home to venture out into the Los Angeles Wasteland.


Speaking during a press panel ahead of today's trailer reveal, co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet explained that while the adaptation is set in the world of Fallout, it's also a "new story that comes after the events we've seen" in the games. "The show is built on 25 years of creativity and thinking and building," co-showrunner Graham Wagner added, "and we sort of thought the best thing to do is to continue that versus retread it. Because that's sort of what has worked with Fallout over the years. It's traded hands... it's a living thing... and we felt like we ought to take a swing at trying to build a new piece on top of all of that."

To recap, Sweet Baby Inc. recently became the target of a group which claimed the company was forcing studios it worked with to increase diversity within its games, and accused it of pushing a "woke agenda" into the industry. Following a report into the claims by Kotaku, a number of game developers have spoken up to clear up misconceptions about what companies like Sweet Baby Inc. actually do. 
Kenney, who has written for games including Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Telltale's The Walking Dead and the upcoming Marvel's Wolverine, posted a thread on X yesterday. "Some of you don't seem to understand how narrative consulting on games works," she began, "but don't worry: I do!"

On Sleight of Hand's release next year across Xbox Series X/S and PC (including day one on Game Pass), players will take on the role of Lady Luck, a former occult detective "fated to return for one final job". And that job? Taking down her former Coven after a "less than amicable departure" which saw her lose her left hand. 


"Too tired to fight fate any longer, and with more overdue bills than bucks to her name, Lady Luck strikes out to Steeple City with a cursed deck in hand, ready to track down everyone from her past life," reads Sleight of Hands description.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have been playing Minecraft for the last decade or so and been thinking, 'I really enjoy this game, but I wish they would change up the wolves up a bit', then I have good news: Eight new wolf variations are coming to Minecraft, first via the Bedrock Edition beta and preview builds and Minecraft: Java Edition's latest snapshot.


In a blog post shared yesterday, Mojang detailed each new wolfy variant. The wolves all live in their own, specific areas, with the Rusty wolf "hiding between the jungle vines". The Spotted wolf, meanwhile, can be found in the Savanna Plateau. 


Other wolves currently being put through the test are: The Black wolf, the Striped wolf, the Snowy wolf, the Ashen wolf, the Woods wolf and the Chestnut wolf. Meanwhile, Minecraft's original wolf is now going to be known as the Pale wolf.

While at camps, players can cook up a feast - as is the case with plenty of RPGs these days - but many fans have been speculating as to whether these cooking scenes are real or CGI.


Even PlayStation couldn't make up its mind and launched a poll on social media site X.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The EU is stepping in to investigate the latest development in the feud between Apple and Epic, with European regulators now seeking answers from Apple on yesterday's news - that it had banned Epic's developer account. 
To recap, Epic announced it would be launching an iOS version of its store in Europe back in February, following Apple's confirmation it would be complying with the EU's Digital Markets Act requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices. Epic subsequently received an official Apple Developer Account, and said it planned to launch its app store sometime this year.
Yesterday, however, it was revealed that Apple had now terminated Epic's developer account on the basis the company had been "verifiably untrustworthy" in the past, a move which Epic said was a "serious violation of the [Digital Markets Act]" within the EU. Now, a European Commission spokesperson confirmed to Reuters it had "requested further explanations" on the ban under the DMA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Larian has issued another hotfix (number 21) for Baldur's Gate 3 across PC, PlayStation 5 and Mac. However, those on Xbox will have to wait a little longer for this and the game's previous hotfix to arrive, as they are still going through testing.
Sharing details of its most recent fix, Larian stated it had found a crash bug that was only affecting Xbox. "We're taking the time to investigate and solve that issue, so your future adventures go a little smoother," Larian said.
A knock on effect of this delay means cross-saves are currently not loadable on Xbox consoles, if they come from other platforms which have been updated with to include hotfixes 20 or 21. The developer apologised for this, and said it is working to sort these Xbox fixes "as soon as possible".

Seccomp stands for secure computing mode and has been a feature of the Linux
kernel since version 2.6.12. It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a
process, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the
kernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a
node to your Pods and containers.
But distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,
because the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can
possibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles
Operator solve that problem by
running as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that
distribution could be done by the container
runtime.
Runtimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer LocalThunk's Balatro might have hit a bit of a bump last week after an unexpected ratings change, but that hasn't stopped the acclaimed poker-inspired rogue-like deckbuilder from selling over half a million copies in ten days, according to publisher Playstack.


That's an impressive figure for what's a fairly unassuming card game at first glance. Balatro, if you're unfamiliar, challenges players to progress through a series of stage-like Blinds by exceeding each one's target score. A maximum of four poker hands can played each blind, and failure to reach the target, in classic rogue-like fashion, results in a game over.


As you can probably guess, though, there's a lot more to it than that, with successful Blinds rewarding in-game money to spend on the likes of fancy combo-boosting cards, exotic upgrades, and, crucially, a heap of rule-bending Jokers that quickly turn a relatively unremarkable set-up into an outlandish game of ludicrous, score-busting synergies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 21.31pm: The Washington Post reporter responsible for a story claiming Square Enix's Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy had been confirmed as a PlayStation console exclusive by Sony has partially retracted the statement.


Originally, the report claimed, "Securing the Final Fantasy 7 trilogy as a console exclusive is a feather in the PlayStation cap", but, in a note on social media, Washington Post games reporter Gene Park offered a clarification, writing, "It was a mistake on my part to write the sentence like that." Park now says, "The entire FF7 trilogy is NOT yet confirmed to be Sony exclusive. The article has been amended to only mention Remake and Rebirth."


Of course, with Remake and Rebirth still being described as PlayStation console exclusives in the Washington Post report (an assertion you'd assume has now been very thoroughly run by Sony and Square), it would be unusual if the third entry in the series proved to be an outlier - but for now, consider the exclusivity status of part three still unconfirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who want to prepare for the release of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl later this year by replaying the series' original trilogy, I have good news. They are now on Xbox and Playstation, making it the first time these games have been available on console.
The Legends of the Zone bundle groups together Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat in one nice package. If you would rather just pick the games up one at a time, you are able to do that as well.
The Legends of the Zone bundle retails at £33.50, while the games individually cost £9.99 each, on the Microsoft Store. Over on the PlayStation Store, the trilogy is currently listed for £15.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic's plans to launch a version of its Epic Games Store on iOS in the EU have stalled after Apple terminated its developer account, calling the company "verifiably untrustworthy" - and the much-trumpeted return of Fortnite to iOS has been impacted too. 


Epic announced it would be launching an iOS version of its store in Europe back in February, following Apple's confirmation it would be complying with the EU's Digital Markets Act requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices. While Epic boss Tim Sweeney immediately launched a social media tirade in response to the announcement - calling Apple's planned implementation of the EU's rules "hot garbage" - Epic soon confirmed it had officially received an Apple Developer Account and would be launching a version of its Epic Games Store, operated by Epic Games Sweden, sometime this year.


Now, however, Epic claims Apple has terminated its Epic Games Sweden AB developer account, preventing it from developing an iOS store - a move it says is  "a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices."

McMahon had previously been expected to appear in the game's roster, but publisher 2K confirmed both McMahon and Brock Lesnar had been cut after allegations of sexual assault and trafficking against the former were made earlier this year.
Despite this, McMahon appears in some parts of the game's showcase mode, which allows players to play through iconic moments in WrestleMania history. The showcase includes real footage and in-game recreations of the events, with McMahon censored in some places.

Ghost of Tsushima launched for PlayStation 4 and PS5 back in July 2020, and a Director's Cut - bundling together the acclaimed base game, its Iki Island expansion, and cooperative online multiplayer Legends mode - arrived the following year. It's this version that'll be hitting PC in May, with Sony having now detailed some of the game's PC-specific enhancements.


As revealed in a post on the PlayStation Blog, Ghost of Tsushima for PC will offer unlocked frame rates, various graphics settings and presets, customisable mouse and keyboard controls, plus "extensive" controller support. It is, for instance, possible to use Steam Input to remap and customise the controller of your choice, and those using a DualSense controller can take advantage of its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

As you would expect from Design Lab, those who fancy grabbing themselves a Fallout-inspired Xbox controller will also be able to customise it with a variety of button styles, triggers and D-pad options (although Xbox has laid out some ideas inspired by Vault Dwellers, the Brotherhood, the Pip-Boy and, of course, mutants).

"For me personally, there is a small element that I feel has not yet been discovered. So, whether that's up to user interpretation or up to just further investigation and playing, that's something I'm looking forward to," said Miyazaki. "I think it's a question of when and not if, but there may be something small still missing."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking to bring a bit of summer sun into the lingering bleakness of a waning winter, then boy do I have a recommendation for you - assuming you're up for some pitch-black, emotionally pulverising horror. Mediterranea Inferno, last year's dazzling visual novel from The Milky Way Prince creator Lorenzo Redaelli, is out now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.


Mediterranea Inferno follows a trio of beautiful, fashionable Milan club kids in their early 20s as they reunite, after two years apart due to lingering COVID restrictions, for a three-day vacation in the blazing heat of a southern Italian summer. What follows is an artfully orchestrated descent into nightmare - a vicious, emotionally pummelling, and unabashedly queer tale of friendship and post-COVID trauma where players, in Redaelli's own words, can push "three bourgeois twinks...towards the most horrible and gruesome endings".


It's an absolute sledgehammer of a game - "a dense, provocative, playful, exasperating, horrifying, poetic, often very funny, and occasionally even profound rumination on the sometimes paralysing search for a place in the disenfranchising shadow of modern-day life", as I wrote in my five star review - and easily the most relentlessly stylish game of 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight months after Warner Bros.' platform-brawler MultiVersus went dark, following an announcement its open beta would be shutting down until a return sometime in 2024, its social media account has sprung back to live, teasing an update announcement soon.


MultiVersus launched into Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC open beta back in July 2022, and got off to a flying start - ratcheting up over 10m players in the space of a month. However, its player numbers rapidly dwindled and by the time developer Play First Games pulled the game offline last June, its Steam concurrent player count had fallen from a high of 153,000 to just 448.


As to when MultiVersus would be likely to return, that remained vague, with Play First Games only saying it expected servers to come back online sometime in "early 2024". And it's proven to be a particularly controversial period of downtime, not only for its length but because Warner Bros. refused to refund players for any packs, passes, premium currency bundles, or cosmetics they'd purchased across MutliVersus' nearly year-long, multi-season open beta, insisting all purchased items would be usable again once the game returned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades, the acclaimed rogue-like dungeon-crawler from developer Supergiant - and by 'acclaimed', we're talking Game-of-the-Year levels of good here - launches for iOS as part of a Netflix subscription later this month, on 19th March.


Hades, the fourth game from Supergiant - following the studio's impressive Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre - charts protagonist Zagreus' attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, all with a little bit of help from an entire pantheon of Greek gods.


It's an isometric action-adventure built around a wonderfully punchy combat system that follows the classic rogue-like template by offering handy permanent upgrades after an escape attempt fails, all in aid of helping Zagreus inch just a little bit closer to freedom each time.

Speaking during a recent Morgan Stanley event (thanks Gamespot), Perrette said the company would combat volatility by focusing on its biggest franchises and bringing some to the mobile and free-to-play space in addition to live-service games. The aim is more consistent revenue.


"We're doubling down on games as an area where we think there is a lot more growth opportunity that we can tap into with the IP that we have and some of the capabilities we have on the studio where we're uniquely positioned as both a publisher and a developer of games," he said.

Along with the PC specifications, which are shown below, the studios have also shed more light on the graphics presets and other variables players will be able to select. 
Presets range from low to high, with the Forbidden West team stating this will allow those with the latest tech to "push their systems, while also providing a great experience on less powerful PCs".

The video, posted to LinkedIn by a former Free Radical Design staff member, shows a version of the game from July 2023 - roughly five months before the project was cancelled and the studio shut down by parent company Embracer.


TimeSplitters fans will likely be excited (and upset, seeing as the project is now dead) to see numerous familiar elements return, including an expanded Siberia dam level, iconic weapons, fan-favourite characters and GoldenEye's classic health/shield UI.

On 29th March, Meta will delete any remaining Oculus accounts and all apps, associated store credits, achievements, and friend lists. Past that date, it'll be lost unless users migrate to a Meta account using the email address on their Oculus account.

Meta has been sending emails to Meta Quest owners to remind them of the deadline (via The Verge), following a gradual shift from Oculus accounts, which are linked to Facebook accounts, to email-based Meta accounts.

Earlier this month, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse suggested the Xbox physical version of the hit RPG may release on four discs, rather than the original plan of three, calling it a "very dynamic situation".
However, he has now confirmed that that extra fourth disc is indeed needed. As previously announced, the PlayStation 5 version will ship on two discs, while the PC version just has the one.

Now, Giant Bomb's ever chatty reporter Jeff Grubb has stated this team is working on a "Titanfall game" set in the same universe as the series' first two entries - but stressed that this was not currently planned to be Titanfall 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's first season of post-launch content gets underway on 28th March, introducing The Joker as a new playable character. Additionally, the delayed Epic Games Store version of Suicide Squad is now scheduled to launch on 26th March.


When developer Rocksteady detailed its post-launch plans for Suicide Squad in January, it confirmed each of the four seasons it's currently committed to will bring a new playable DC character (each yanked from an alternate-reality Elseworlds), plus a new playable environment, new activities, new weapons and gear sets, mid-season updates, and "more".


Season 1's Elseworlds Joker has already raised a few eyebrows, thanks to his dainty mace and not-exactly-on-brand rocket-powered umbrella that'll let him launch into the air, drift, and grind on buildings to knock enemies out of the way. If that appeals though, he arrives alongside his new environment, two new episodes - featuring missions, activities, and strongholds - new boss fights and enemy variants, new Riddler content, and new DC Villain-themed weapons and gear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behold the ultimate form of the Xbox Series X; Microsoft has unveiled an official SpongeBob SquarePants special editon of the console that makes the best, most glorious use of its oblong shape yet. Unfortunately, it's US-only at present, so boo.


Microsoft's new 'Xbox Series X – Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 Special Edition Bundle' has, as its name very strongly suggests, been created to promote last year's Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, a Smash Bros.-style fighter that pits (yes) a bunch of Nickelodeon characters against each other in a family friendly fight to the family friendly death. That includes Invader Zim and Rocko from Rocko's Modern Life, so you'll hear no bad words from me. Needs more Pete & Pete though.


Anyway, the highlight of Microsoft's new Xbox Series X is undoubtedly the console itself, which transforms the machine's usual oblong heft in the absolute most perfect way, turning it into a beaming yellow SpongeBob that would look at home in any living room - assuming the living room owners have very specific tastes. Additionally, it comes with a genuinely awesome controller featuring Squidward, Gary, and Mr. Krabs, plus a copy of All-Star Brawl 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator Yuzu, has agreed to pay $2.4m in damages to Nintendo and cease all operations in response to the Mario maker's recent lawsuit.


News of Nintendo's legal action against Yuzu surfaced last week, with the company claiming the emulator facilitated piracy "at a colossal scale". By way of example, it said over 1m copies of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had been illegally downloaded ahead of its official launch - and that "many" pirate websites specified the game file was playable on Yuzu.


"Defendant [Tropic Haze] is thus secondarily liable for the infringement committed by the users to whom it distributes Yuzu", Nintendo's lawyers argued, with the lawsuit ultimately seeking damages and demanding the emulator be shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend, Fortnite simultaneously did something it had never done before, and something it hadn't done in ages. On the game's storied battle royale Island, players looked on as a giant hand made out of rapidly-cooling lava burst out of the ground, clasping an enormous treasure box that then lay, danging, high up in the air. 


The hand's appearance had been much anticipated. Rhythmic rumblings had been tracked by fans to a spot outside Ruined Reels - a sort-of Greek amphitheature turned open-air cinema - and a slowly widening crack in the ground nearby. A new character, the aptly-named Odyssey, had already appeared nearby to dole out some much-needed exposition and teasing for Fortnite's incoming Ancient Greek-themed new season. And outside the game, dataminers quickly discovered what was about to happen and posted it all on social media. The stage was set. 


So when the hand emerged, people knew what to do. That big box? It could be opened, if the chains around it were broken. And so players got to work. Some ignored Fortnite's normal battle royale rules completely, sticking instead to simply landing on the Island and shooting/pickaxing the chest's restraints, breaking them over the course of several hours, one-by-one. Others, predictably, decided to capitalise on all this by setting up camp nearby and sniping those trying to open the box. Debate raged about player etiquette - something which took me back to the outrage at people who wiped out upwards of 50-players at once as they settled in to watch Fortnite's first ever in-game event, the rocket launch, back in 2018.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Crema has announced it'll be removing all monetisation from its Pokemon-like creature-battler Temtem in an update scheduled for June, with one final major patch to follow before updates refocus on bug fixing and balance changes.


Crema shared the news in a lengthy post on Steam, which spent a lot of time addressing ongoing player complaints around a lack of major new content since launch, such as more islands, new Temtem, or additional multiplayer features. Broadly, the studio says Temtem's early access demonstrated major new content didn't have a significant impact on the game's player base, making it difficult to justify the development resources required - although other issues, such as mounting technical debt, are also cited as concerns.


After a lot of words, including some regret over having described the game as an "MMO" in its marketing material, Crema gets to the crux of its post: that it will release two more major updates for Temtem before development switches to more modest bug fixing and balance patches, as the studio's focus turns to new projects.

And, presumably much more importantly for Conan fans, there'll be no penis sliders either.
There will be sand-walking, though, and there's no ruling out of sandworm-riding down the line. We spoke with Dune: Awakening's creative director Joel Bylos at some length in our preview, and he explained the decision like this:
"We actually looked into it. It's just a very strong technical cost, and also a very - it needs a purpose. And we haven't got what the movie has, which is like, 'Go through the southern sandstorms, get to the southern part [of Arrakis]'. So yeah, we don't have that yet."

Billed as appropriate for 3 years and above, and advertising fun and exploration, I used up 40GB of my precious, SSD space to install Fortnite and visit Jonesy's whimsical chocolate factory.
Yes, I'm still thinking about the infamous Willy Wonka Experience held in a sadly-decorated warehouse in Glasgow. I didn't visit it in real life for myself, but all of us have already been able to experience it vicariously through memes, quotes from frustrated parents, and interviews with the poor actors who had no idea what they were getting themselves into when they signed their contracts.
And now it's in Fortnite. After trying it myself, I imagine the actual thing was pretty similar to Jonesy's Chocolate Factory Experience, a Fortnite Creative map made by player ImSachiko. With a complimentary jelly bean being handed out and children crying in the corner, it does not disappoint.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greedfall 2: The Dying World will launch in early access.
Citing the game's ambition as a reason, producer Reda Isber explained in a recent livestream that the team would be "relying heavily" on the feedback of players during the early access period to ensure development was "heading in the right direction".
The team also alerted players that saves won't be "compatible between the various updates", so that's something to bear in mind if you were thinking of getting involved.

Earlier this week, Ed reported Nintendo was suing the creators of Switch emulator Yuzu, claiming more than one million copies of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were pirated ahead of its release.
In the lawsuit, Nintendo claimed that by allowing Yuzu emulator users to play its games illegally by circumventing its software encryption, Tropic Haze facilitates piracy "at a colossal scale".

Whilst there's been no formal word that the new content – which was bundled in with premium editions of the game – is coming any time soon, similar "unknown apps" were added to prior Bethesda games like Fallout 4, which later turned out to be expansions like Nuka-World and Valut-tec Workshop.
No, this is not definitive proof that any DLC is coming, let alone Shattered Space, but it's our strongest hint yet that additional content is on the way for Starfield fans. So watch this space, eh?

<blockquote><p>Prior research suggests that the vampyromorph lived in the shallows off an island that once existed in what is now the heart of the European mainland. The research team believes that the remarkable degree of preservation of this squid is due to unique conditions at the moment of the creature&#8217;s death. Water at the bottom of the sea where it ventured would have been poorly oxygenated, causing the creature to suffocate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balatro, the poker-themed rogue-like from solo developer LocalThunk that's been a huge critical and commercial hit since releasing last week, has been unexpectedly yanked from sale in some countries, with publisher Playstack blaming the issue on a surprise ratings change.


Playstack addressed the issue in a lengthy statement shared on social media, explaining Balatro's temporary removal from console stores had so far only happened "some countries". It admitted it could not "estimate with complete confidence which stores" had been impacted, adding, "Our hope is that only a minority of stores will be affected". It says it remains "highly confident" Balatro will remain available on PC, including Steam.


The cause of all this frustration is an unexpected "overnight change" to Balatro's age rating, which has been bumped from 3+ to 18+. According to Playstack, this change stems from an unspecified ratings board's "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has announced its dark action-RPG No Rest for the Wicked will launch into Steam early access on 18th April.


No Rest for the Wicked, which was unveiled during last year's The Game Awards, is described by Moon Studios as an "expansive" and "visceral" action-RPG that's "set to reinvent the genre". It casts players as a Cerim - a holy warrior "imbued with remarkable powers" - who embarks on a journey across the harsh Isola Sacra to defeat an unholy plague.


Its campaign promises a "mature, dark" narrative, as well as "brutal, precision-based" combat, and a hand-crafted world, with players can take on No Rest for the Wicked's challenges, quests, and bosses either solo or with up to three friends by their side.

As reported yesterday, employees at Rockstar have been told to return to the office five days a week, now that GTA 6 is entering the final stretch of development. Studio management cited security and productivity reasons for this upcoming change, which will come into effect in April.
Since this announcement, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has blasted Rockstar for its plans to withdraw remote working provisions for the "majority" of its staff, noting the studio said any exceptions to the new rules will be "rare".

A message sent around the official Arrowhead Discord this morning warned the community of these fake games, stating that the only legitimate releases were Helldivers 2 and Helldivers 2: Super Citizen Edition with the correct release date of 8th February.
"People posting as us trying to scam people is obviously very sad and frustrating, and for that as well as for security reasons we urge you to stay clear of them," Arrowhead's community manager wrote. "Again, the only two Helldivers 2 products we market are Helldivers 2 and Helldivers 2 Super Citizen Edition."

One of those characters, Space Dude, is the star of developer Poncle's energetic Space 54 trailer (or Space-54, or Space54 - the studio doesn't seem to have entirely made its mind up), and there's also four new weapons, a new relic, and seven new EXTRA achievements.

Terminator: Survivors is being developed by Nacon Studio Milan, the team behind motorcycle racer Rims Racing and TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3, and is set four years after the catastrophic Judgment Day prophesised in the first two Terminator films.


Cast as a survivor of humanity's near-extinction, players - either working solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - must attempt to "reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating you and the last vestiges of mankind."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toys for Bob - the Activision Blizzard studio behind the likes of Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot 4, and the Spyro remasters - has announced it's parting ways with Activision to become an independent company once more. It also says it's "exploring a possible partnership" with Microsoft as development on its new game gets underway.


Toys for Bob, which was founded back in 1989, formed a publishing partnership with Activision in the 2000s that would lead to the studio's acquisition by the publisher in 2005. Toys for Bob has been part of Activision Blizzard ever since, initially working on the hugely popular toys-to-life Skylanders series before developing 2018 remaster Spyro Reignited Trilogy and 2020's well-received Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. Since then, it's served as a support studio for Call of Duty while also releasing last year's Crash Team Rumble.


Earlier this month, following Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard and subsequent decision to lay off 1,900 workers across its Xbox teams, it was confirmed 86 Toys for Bob employees had lost their jobs. It was also reported the studio's physical office would be shutting down and that remaining staff would transition to working from home. And it's in this context that Toys for Bob has now announced it's splitting from Activision to go independent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports last year that Embracer Group was considering selling Borderlands studio Gearbox as part of its ongoing "comprehensive restructuring programme", it's now being claimed a sale to a third party is in the "late stages" of being finalised.


That's according to Kotaku, which says Gearbox CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford had previously told staff the studio was facing one of three possible scenarios: it would either stay with Embracer, be sold, or would finance a buyout and become independent once more. However, Pitchford reportedly shared an update with employees earlier this week, saying a decision had been made - and that decision, according to Kotaku's sources, was to sell.


The publication understands Gearbox's sale to an unnamed buyer is currently in the "late stages of being finalised", and while Embracer Group - which purchased Gearbox for $363m in 2021 - did not respond to Kotaku's requests for comment, Pitchford deflected the website's inquiries, saying, "We will be thrilled to share whenever we have projects to announce or news to share as we work hard towards our mission to entertain the world."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leap day is now upon us and a couple of games aren't happy about this sudden affront to their usual calendar expectations. Both EA Sports WRC and Theatrhythm Final Bar Line are currently protesting at the arrival of 29th February by refusing to function on consoles - but, luckily for rally fans and beat tappers, there's a pretty straightforward workaround.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line players noticed the Final Fantasy-themed PS4 and Switch rhythm game was failing to connect to Square Enix's servers after the clock struck midnight heralding the arrival 29th February, leaving it functionally unplayable.


Similarly, EA took to social media earlier today to acknowledge Codemasters' World Championship Rally was encountering an "issue on console in which the game may crash on startup." And while it didn't explicitly blame the problem on today's leap year, the publisher's follow-up solution makes it clear 29th February is the culprit.

If you haven't played it, Fallout 2 is one of the classic RPGs which still holds up today. In 2017, Eurogamer was able to visit Obsidian Entertainment and speak to Feargus Urquhart, Leonard Boyarsky and Tim Cain, who all previously worked on Fallout 1 and 2 whilst at Interplay Productions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony-acquired studio Firesprite has recently suffered high profile exits amid accusations of a toxic workplace culture, Eurogamer has been told, as part of an investigation into the studio begun ahead of the layoffs announced by Sony this week.


The Liverpool-based developer released PlayStation VR2 launch title Horizon Call of the Mountain last year, after being acquired by Sony in 2021. But the impact of crunch for that game's release and changes in the company's senior leadership have subsequently led to discontent within the studio, staff have told Eurogamer - something one source described as "death by a thousand cuts".


Most concerning are reports from sources that two senior leaders from Sony support studio XDev, brought in to help lead Firesprite, have since been accused of sexual discrimination and ageism. A subsequent internal investigation by Sony is said to have resulted in the claims being dismissed as a "misunderstanding".

While you may no longer be able to witness the real event in person, you can always relive it vicariously through your Sims. 
Glasgow's Willy Wonka Experience has gone viral for its emptily-decorated space, its AI-generated scripts, and the random shadowy figure called The Unknown who was scaring children.
The whole thing went so badly, it was cancelled halfway through Saturday after police were called to the event, but not before someone could snap one of the most memorable pictures from it - a sad Oompa Loompa being forced to conduct experiments by event organiser House of Illuminati.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I learned there is a Dungeons and Dragons-like Game Master (GM) working behind the scenes on Helldivers 2.
His name is Joel, and his job title at Arrowhead is, well, Game Master. "We have a lot of systems built into the game where the Game Master has a lot of control over the play experience. It's something that we're continuously evolving based on what's happening in the game," Helldivers 2 game director Johan Pilestedt told PC Gamer.
This continuous evolution has actually seen Joel getting up at unsociable hours to sort out situations when the Helldivers 2 team realised the game wasn't as balanced as it could be. "There have been some sudden moments where maybe one planet was too easy or one was too hard and [Joel] had to get up in the middle of the night to give the Automatons a bit of reinforcement so the players don't take [the planet] too quickly," Pilestedt said.

This hotfix takes aim at several bugs and quirks still lingering in Baldur's Gate 3. This includes a fix for banding and shader issues in cinematics and those times characters claimed to be too busy to talk to you. "They were lying," Larian explained.
Meanwhile, Minthara should no longer refuse to follow along with the party in Acts 2 and 3. In the developer's own words: "You should find her more willing to fall in line now - at least in terms of keeping up. She's still something of a free spirit."

But now that server issues due to the game's popularity have been sorted, it seems developer Arrowhead Studios is finally moving on to more interesting improvements.

Despite initial poor sales and lacklustre reviews for Immortals of Aveum when it released in August 2023, Robbins said he believes the game's future will be successful like Dead Space. "People were discovering [Dead Space] for years and years," Robbins stated, "I think Immortals will be the same."

As reported by Bloomberg, an email sent to staff by Rockstar's head of publishing Jenn Kolbe stated the decision to end hybrid work was made - in part - with security reasons in mind.
Rockstar was the subject of a high profile hack in 2022, in which over 90 screenshots and videos were released online showing work on the then unannounced GTA 6. Then, last year, the studio released its first official GTA 6 trailer ahead of schedule, after it too leaked online.

In an email to staff announcing today's layoffs, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said the cuts were part of a continuing effort to "optimise our global real estate footprint to best support our business". 


In order to achieve its goals, Wilson said EA will be "streamlining [its] company operations", "sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry". Additionally, it'll "double down on our biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, the iOS and Android version of Activision Blizzard's battle royale hit, is officially getting its worldwide launch on 21st March following a limited release in select counties over the course of the last year.


Warzone Mobile, which is being developed by Activision's Digital Legends, Beenox, Shanghai, and Solid State studios, initially launched in Australia back in November 2022. Following its roll-out across a number of other countries, Activision announced it would be getting its full release in autumn last year - but plans changed in October, when the publisher confirmed it had made the decision to postpone its launch to "spring" 2024 in order to "polish up" the experience.


With Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile's worldwide release now locked down to 21st March, Activision has started talking specifics, confirming the game will launch with two maps: Verdansk - which supports 120-player battle royale matches - and Rebirth Island, which supports 48-player battle royale matches using Gulag-free Resurgence rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the shocking news that the next big Pokémon game is mysteriously set to arrive in 2025. Hey, that sounds a lot like the intro to last week's episode, when we were discussing Switch 2! Say, could Pokémon Legends: Z-A also be set to arrive on Nintendo's next console?
It's been a long time since Nintendo didn't launch a major Pokémon game or expansion in a calendar year, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A's arrival in 2025 certainly looks suspicious - as does yesterday's reveal of the game without any look at actual gameplay.
So, have we just been given another piece of the Switch 2 puzzle? What do we expect to see in the mysterious Z-A when it is fully revealed? And how many bad French-themed Pokémon ideas can we come up with? With me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahmed Best, who's best known for his performance as Jar-Jar Binks in the Star Wars prequels, has issued a cryptic tease that has set Star Wars fans' tongues wagging.


"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in," Best posted on Instagram, alongside a photo of himself clad in a performance capture suit. He accompanied the caption with a string of hashtags:  "#mocap #starwars #jarjarbinks #activision #jedi #sithlord #kelleranbeq"


It's unclear what Best is back in a performance capture suit for, though the mention of Activision has fans pondering whether the actor is secretly working on a new Star Wars game from the publisher, or whether he's performing mo-cap for some kind of Call of Duty crossover.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long old wait for UFO 50 - the 50-strong anthology of 8-bit-inspired games from Spelunky creator Derek Yu's Mossmouth studio - but as the seventh anniversary of its announcement approaches this August, Yu has revealed the promising project is currently on track to release in the second half of this year.


When UFO 50 was announced in 2017, the goal was to launch it the following year; that, obviously, did't happen, with Yu last year explaining the longer-the-expected development time was simply down to the team having wildly underestimated how long it would take to make 50 games, particularly given Spelunky 2 was being made in the middle of it all.


UFO 50, if you're unfamiliar, isn't a mini- or micro-game compilation, but a collection of complete 8-bit game experiences (albeit of varying sizes) created as if from a long-forgotten fictional 80s video game company, with sequels and reappearing characters creating a sense of shared continuity. It promises everything from platformers and shoot 'em ups to puzzle games, roguelites, and RPGs, with over half featuring local multiplayer including co-op and versus play.

Game director Todd Papy left the studio last month, according to LinkedIn. MassivelyOP has since reported a number of other high profile losses at the company (via Game Developer), including lead producer Jake Ross, level designer Dane Kubicka, Austin QA lead Vincent Sinatra, and Austin senior QA analyst Andrew Rexroth.




Further, former producer Annie Bouffard shared on LinkedIn that she had resigned from a "highly toxic company" and claimed she was "gaslighted" when she expressed concern about potential layoffs. She said mass layoffs had been disguised as a "relocation of staff" when few were able or willing to move.

Episode 12 of season 35, Lisa Gets an F1, aired on 25th February, and follows Lisa as she becomes a professional kid go-kart racer whilst dealing with her anxiety stemming from Homer's dangerous driving. As Homer worries about Lisa's safety, one night he has a nightmare where he, Lisa, and a number of other children are driving in an off-kilter version of Mario Kart.
"It's me, Lisa Mario," Lisa proclaims at the starting line of Rainbow Road, fully decked out with a blue hat, moustache, and her dress altered to look like Mario's overalls. She's joined by Ralph dressed up as Toad, Nelson tranformed into Bowser, and one of the Mackleberry twins as Princess Peach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new documentary has shed more light on Resident Evil 4 Remake's development, and shows its director concerned the game would not be ready for its release date.
A recent episode of 100 Cameras - a Japanese documentary series which puts 100 cameras in situ to capture the goings on in any given place - focused on Capcom. Along with a look behind the scenes of Street Fighter 6, the episode also showed a slice of Resident Evil 4 Remake's development (thanks, GamesRadar).
At the time of recording, there was only one month left before Resident Evil 4 Remake was set to release, but the game was reportedly riddled with a "storm" of issues. These included game freezes, visual glitches such as characters' hands not connecting when they are meant to be holding on to each other, and Leon getting sent to "another dimension" as he falls through the floor. One tester said they had found "around 70" new bugs in one day. Things were once so bad, Resident Evil 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Anpo admitted: "At this rate, we won't make the release".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans are hopeful that expansion The Answer will come to Persona 3 Reload after dataminers discovered references to DLC.


Persona 3 Reload released last month as a remake of the 2006 original. However, it was criticised for being incomplete without the inclusion of The Answer expansion and the female protagonist featured in revised versions Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable.


The latest hint to an expansion comes from YouTuber Faz (thanks PCGamer), who discovered an in-game message for completing the game on the highest Merciless difficulty (or at least using a cheat engine to skip ahead).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A study conducted by Norwegian researchers has suggested children feel increasing social pressure to spend money in games.
The study, commissioned by the Norwegian government's Ministry of Children and Family Affairs, was conducted by researchers Clara Julia Reich and Kamilla Knutsen Steinnes at Oslo Metropolitan University's National Institute for Consumer Research.
An overview of the two resulting reports, originally written in Norwegian, by ScienceNorway.no reveals children the pair spoke to worried about being bullied and being unable to make friends unless they spent money to buy cosmetic items (thanks, Crossplay).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over seven years since Limbo and Inside developer Playdead first began teasing its mysterious third project, and now - nearly five years since Eurogamer last has cause to write about a sneaky bit of concept art - the studio has shared a handful of new images, confirming (in case there was any doubt) the project is still alive and well.


A first enigmatic bit of concept art for Playdead's untitled third game was shared by the developer in 2017, around six months after Inside launched to critical acclaim. At the time, the studio confirmed work was underway on its "next adventure", with the accompanying artwork pointing to a lonely adventure with sci-fi undertones.


Since then, further bits of atmospheric concept art have sporadically surfaced - first on social media in 2018, then buried in some online job listings in 2019, then on LinkedIn last year - all seemingly pointing to an adventure in which a lone space traveller wanders a desolate planet strewn with abandoned tech. About all we've conclusively learned of the mysterious project in that time, again thanks to Playdead's jobs page, is that it's a "third-person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deck Nine Games, the studio behind Life is Strange: True Colors and last year's The Expanse: A Telltale Series, has announced it's laying off approximately 20 percent of its total workforce, blaming "the game industry's worsening market conditions".


Deck Nine is perhaps best known as the current steward of Square Enix's supernatural narrative adventure series Life is Strange, having created 2017's Life is Strange: Before the Storm, 2021's Life is Strange: True Colours, and a remaster of series originator Don't Nod's acclaimed first instalment in 2022. More recently it co-developed a prequel to popular sci-fi TV show The Expanse alongside the revived Telltales Games.


Deck Nine confirmed its decision to lay off a fifth of its staff - likely around 30 employees based on its most recently shared headcount - in a statement on social media, writing, "Like many others in the games industry right now, Deck Nine has been affected by the game industry's worsening market conditions. Today we made the difficult decision to lay off 20% of our staff."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones, the oft-delayed pirate game from Ubisoft that finally arrived earlier this month following almost a decade of development, has released its first season of post-launch content on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC - introducing, among other things, new world events, new contracts and bounties, plus a battle-pass-style progression track.


Raging Tides, as Skull and Bones' first live-service season is officially titled, predominantly focuses on new antagonist Philippe La Peste (AKA the Plague King) and his Fleet of Pestilence. By defeating La Peste's advance guard, the Plaguebringers, as they spawn throughout the world, players can raise the fleet's hostility level. Once past a certain threshold, they'll face a "mighty foe", which rewards a "rare item" when sunk.


That's the core of Raging Tides' new content, then, but Season 1 also adds two elite boss Kingpin Bounties - Jaws of Retribution: Introducing Zamaharibu and Anguish from the Abyss: Rode Maangodin - which run from 5-26th March and 26th March to 16th April respectively.

Reynatis wasn't present in the showcase for overseas, but yesterday NIS America announced it'll also be released outside of Japan on Nintendo Switch, PC (Steam), PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
The announcement trailer gives us a flavour of the magic-infused world of Reynatis, set in contemporary Shibuya.  The immediate vibes the trailer gives off are Kingdom Hearts meets The World Ends With You, with some hints of Final Fantasy Versus 13 and Kingdom Hearts 3's game-within-a-game Verum Rex. You have my attention, Reynatis.

The announcement was made at the end of today's Pokémon Presents stream, in celebration of Pokémon Day 2024.
Pokémon Legends: Z-A looks to be a follow-up to 2022's Pokémon Legends: Arceus but set in a futuristic version of Kalos from Pokémon X and Y - the opposite of Arceus, which transported players to a historical version of Sinnoh. A trailer showed a futuristic version of Lumiose City from Pokémon X and Y, which looked a bit like the Grid in Tron.

The first of these is a multiplayer mini-game themed around Lego's popular pirates theme, where you must stay afloat on a raft - and repair it on the fly - while it is under attack from cannon fire. 


The latter is an obstacle course mini-game similar to those found within Fortnite's user-made Creative mode already - think along the lines of its many parkour levels or popular Only Up maps.

In a post earlier today, Sony's Jim Ryan said the company's PlayStation community meant "everything to us", and therefore it felt compelled to share an update on the current situation.
"We have made the extremely hard decision to announce our plan to commence a reduction of our overall headcount globally by about eight percent or about 900 people, subject to local law and consultation processes. Employees across the globe, including our studios, are impacted," Ryan wrote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A number of developers have said they are concerned about the future of Apple Arcade, with one person stating there is "the smell of death" around the mobile game subscription service.


A source told mobilegamer.biz that Apple had "cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people" following a 'reboot' of the subscription in 2021. Other sources, meanwhile, said the company had been steadily cutting developer payouts and upfront fees over recent years.


"We're going to see that amount and decrease and decrease and decrease until it's pennies," one developer told the publication. "At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable." Reportedly, when Apple Arcade launched in 2019, it was a different story, with "very generous" upfront and per-play payments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "biggest regret" of the developer behind Cities: Skylines 2 is the game's ongoing lack of modding support, Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen has said.
Writing in the studio's latest developer diary, posted on publisher Paradox Interactive's forum, Hallikainen also detailed the changes Colossal is now looking into based on player feedback.
The city-builder sequel released in October last year on PC and was immediately criticised by players for its performance issues and, yes, missing official mod support. In response to fan complaints the game's launch had been a "mess" and a "disaster", Hallikainen admitted Colossal would "much rather be in a different position than we are in the moment, but we cannot change the past".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Xbox exclusive Pentiment currently runs smoother on PlayStation 5 than on Xbox Series X/S, fans have realised - prompting the game's director to blame the situation on a "bug". 
Social media user PeterOvo shared a screenshot from a video comparison capturing the frames per second performance between Pentiment on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The former was running at 120fps, while the Xbox version was running at a mere 60fps.
This inconsistency was subsequently brought to the attention of Pentiment's director, Josh Sawyer. The developer replied to assure players that 120fps will be enabled for Xbox "in the next patch".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ark: Survival Ascended developer Studio Wildcard has announced it's indefinitely delaying the release of the dinosaur survival remaster's enhanced The Center expansion, just days before its planned 28th February release.


Ark: Survival Ascended - the controversial full-price Unreal Engine 5 remaster of 2015's Ark: Survival Evolved - has been plagued with delays since its announcement last year. First, the remaster's launch was shifted from August to October - a release it eventually managed to hit on PC, albeit with the Xbox Series X/S version getting a last-minute delay to mid-November and the PS5 release arriving later still - while Ascended's various expansion remasters, originally due to launch alongside the base game, have now slipped a number of times.


In January, Wildcard announced its Scorched Earth expansion remaster, initially delayed to December 2023 and then moved to March 2024, would now be releasing in April, while its Aberration and Ragnarok map remasters - previously delayed to "Q1 2024" - were now on track to arrive in July and September 2024 respectively. Amid all this furious roadmap revision, there was a bright spot in that the enhanced version of Ark's The Center map would now be coming to Ascended a couple of months earlier than listed in December. The Center's release was later pinned down to 28th February, but once again it's all change.

Mike and Sulley arrive as part of what Gameloft is officially calling the Laugh Floor Update, and both make their Dreamlight Valley debut via a new playable Realm - giving players the chance to experience a day-in-the-life at Monsters, Inc. before the duo become available as villagers - each with their own friendship quests and associated rewards.


Other features coming in this week's Laugh Floor Update, as detailed in Gameloft's newly shared patch notes, include more avatar customisation options - ranging from new skin tones and special eye contacts to new ear styles - plus an expansion to Scrooge McDuck's shop, meaning players will see more items to spend their in-game gold on each day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley is celebrating its eighth anniversary today (yes, I couldn't believe it either) and developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has marked the occasion by announcing a release date for his beloved farm-life sim's eagerly awaited 1.6 update - which is coming to PC on 19th March, with a console and mobile release to follow "as soon as possible".


Stardew Valley's 1.6 update was revealed to be in the works back in June 2022, when Barone warned it would be relatively modest in scope and 'mostly modding-focused'. Since then, however, it's ballooned substantially, with Barone so far confirming it'll bring one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and crafting recipes, new dialogue lines, a new farm type, new late-game content, winter outfits for villagers, a new larger chest, 8-player co-op on PC, plus - most importantly of all - hats for cats and dogs.


It was exactly one month ago today that Barone last shared a progress report on 1.6's development, revealing he was "done adding major new content" and that it would "definitely" release this year - and we now have an exact date to mark in our calendars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What the Golf? developer Triband is bringing its absurdist racing game What the Car? to Steam later this year, following its debut last May as an Apple Arcade exclusive.


What the Car? follows in the wonderfully daft footsteps of What the Golf? - and indeed its VR-exclusive baseball-inspired successor What the Bat? - by taking a relatively sensible sport (in this case racing) and sillying it up to the extreme.


If you've long been of the opinion racing games would be a whole lot better if the cars had legs and the racing was spiced up a bit with some cooking, rope jumpinga, CAR-aoke, or even fishing, then What the Car? is probably just what you're looking for.

The upcoming action-RPG is set during the Bakamatsu era of Japan, and will see players play as a Ronin who navigates their way through different political factions as they help to shape the course of history.
Co-op has now been confirmed for Rise of the Ronin via the game's FAQ section (spotted by Okami13_ on X), which states players can join up to three others in online co-op. The FAQs also confirm there will be no PvP in Rise of the Ronin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is currently set to launch its under-wraps Switch 2 console in March 2025 - but this could be delayed further, a new report has cautioned. 


The fresh report, this time from Japanese newspaper Nikkei, has further confirmed this month's reports that Switch 2 will now arrive next year, after having previously been set for a late 2024 launch. 


Eurogamer sources told us previously that a delay to 2025 was intended to ensure Switch 2 arrived with a robust game line-up, something Nikkei's report also mentions. Nikkei additionally suggests a move to 2025 will ensure Switch 2 console stock will also be more readily available.

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of detail in the Apple <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">blog post</a>, and more in Douglas Stabila&#8217;s <a href="https://security.apple.com/assets/files/Security_analysis_of_the_iMessage_PQ3_protocol_Stebila.pdf">security analysis</a>.</p>
<p>I am of two minds about this. On the one hand, it&#8217;s probably premature to switch to any particular post-quantum algorithms. The mathematics of cryptanalysis for these lattice and other systems is still rapidly evolving, and we&#8217;re likely to break more of them&#8212;and learn a lot in the process&#8212;over the coming few years. But if you&#8217;re going to make the switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple&#8217;s ability to do this so efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably more important than its particular cryptographic design. And it is probably about the right time to worry about, and defend against, attackers who are storing encrypted messages in hopes of breaking them later on future quantum computers...</p>]]></summary>

"LittleBigPlanet Hub beta official gameplay full walkthrough recorded in 2013," is all the YouTube video's description says, with a later Short from the same account alleging that the build was still live and could still be downloaded.

Talking to IGN, Miyazaki said that whether it was up to interpretation or "just further investigation", fans needed to look a little harder to find it.

Letho – who had been heading up Seattle-based Ridgeline Games, an EA studio dedicated to the Battlefield franchise – has seemingly scrubbed all mentions of Battlefield and EA from their social media bio, as well as updated their LinkedIn to state they've now left EA.
As spotted by "Battlefield connoisseur" DANNYonPC and Insider Gaming, Ridgeline Games currently has no job openings on its careers site, and Ridgeline's co-founder and art director, Chris Matthews, also left the studio in January 2024 to join Destiny developer Bungie as studio art director.

Talking at today's Siege Invitational 2024 in Brazil, Alexander Karpazis said that having watched other live services games "go through sequels" and "just completely drop the ball", the team would rather "build up" the fan-favourite shooter instead of making a new one.
"The idea of switching engines to something that can be off-the-shelf ready simply doesn't answer the needs of a really competitive and demanding game like Siege," Karpazis said, as transcribed by PC Gamer.

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown enjoyed significant critical acclaim when it launched back in January - Eurogamer's Christian Donlan called it a "real delight...that revels in both its genre and its own heritage" in his four star review - and while early reports have suggested it hasn't fared quite so well commercially, Ubisoft clearly isn't done with the title yet.


In a short video message shared on social media (as spotted by VGC), Lost Crown director Mounir Radi thanked fans for their support, saying, "It means the world to us seeing you enjoy your time with the game just as much as we do. Which is why, I'm especially pleased to let you know that we are far from being done".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly preparing to launch a new white, digital-only version of its top-end Xbox Series X console in "June or July" this year.


An "adorably all-digital" Xbox Series X refresh, planned for a 2024 release, first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year's court battle with the FTC. However, Xbox boss Phil Spencer later insisted "so much has changed" since the plans detailed in the leak had been drawn up, leaving the all-digital console's future uncertain.


But now, noted leaker eXtas1s (writing for Exputer) has claimed that not only are Microsoft's all-digital Xbox Series X plans still alive, the console is set to release "sometime between the upcoming months of June and July" - although "chances for a slight delay" remain.

In its free weekend round two announcement, Hello Games says its first attempt "worked better than expected" and No Man's Sky "started the year with more players than we've EVER had at this time of year", adding, "Our large and friendly community did us proud and jumped at the opportunity to welcome these new Travellers with open arms and show them the ropes."


As before, No Man's Sky's free weekend is open to players on all platforms - Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC - and the latest festivities conclude on Monday, 26th February. Any progress made during the event will be carried over to the full game if you're convinced enough that you decide to make a purchase, and the previous 50 percent discount is still available across digital storefronts, meaning you can pick it up for around £19.99.

The giveaway was announced by Xbox over on X (née Twitter), alongside what I assume is a mock-up of the final design. 
The console features the game's cover art and logo, while the four controllers bundled with it come in four different colours with four different Pals on: yellow (Grizzbolt), green (Mammorest), blue (Pengullet), and pink (Cattiva).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SteamWorld Build publisher Thunderful said the game "fell slightly short of expectations", as its company restructure is "off to a good start".


The game was the latest in the SteamWorld series that turned to strategy and base building gameplay, and was released at the start of December last year.


During the company's latest financial reporting, Thunderful CEO Martin Walfisz put the blame on genre choice not being suited to the Switch, where the series is traditionally stronger (thanks Game Developer). That's despite the game's sales contributing to a record high Q4.

<blockquote><p>LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable and can now interact with tools (i.e., call functions), read documents, and recursively call themselves. As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.</p>
<p>In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLMs...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

During a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said Rocksteady's recent release had "fallen short of our expectations" (thanks, IGN).
The executive did not share any sales figures for Suicide Squard: Kill the Justice League during this call, but admitted it had left the company with a "tough year" ahead when it comes to year-on-year comparisons. Last year, Warner Bros. published Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy, the latter of which became the best selling game in the US in 2023.

In an update on Steam, the Nightingale team said its vision was always to "create an interconnected series of Realms, with the idea of allowing for co-operative exploration in mind - a universe bigger than a single Realm or server". 
As such, the studio made the decision early on to support co-op from day one, rather than focus on an offline mode.

A new NPC character named Odyssey can be found just outside Risky Reels who you can chat to for an update on the current season's storyline (which has so far been pretty threadbare) and a tease for what's next: something to do with an ancient power named the Mosaic.

This discussion has been prompted by the apparent emergence of an early plan for Spider-Man 2's story shared on reddit, originating from the files stolen by hackers who targeted Insomniac Games. In that early draft, one particular plot element was different - sparking debate now on whether it was a good thing Insomniac apparently changed its mind. 
Please note, the rest of this article will contain major spoilers for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Please read on at your own discretion.

I'm going to assume the name is supposed to mean "two KOs", given 2XKO is a 2v2 tag-based fighting game. That also means my brain will call the game 2KO rather than 2XKO. I'm starting to fear this might be a "née Project L" situation...

But behind the scenes, its developer's fate seems to remain uncertain. League of Geeks, previously behind the well-received strategy board game Armello, suffered layoffs in December, with around half of its 70-something team let go.

The numbers, revealed by developer Pocketpair, also confirm 15m players jumped into the action-adventure, monster-taming, survival game on Steam. The other 10m have dived in on Xbox, though Pocketpair didn't specify how many of these were players who bought a copy of the game versus how many were playing via Xbox Game Pass. 
15m copies of Palworld sold on Steam will have made Pocketpair about $315m, which is around £250m, after taking off Valve's 30 percent cut. That money will surely go a long way to helping Pocketpair with its $500k a month spending on servers, as well as hiring developers to no longer be "overwhelmingly short of people".

"Of course, the characters are there and authentic in the themes and even some of the storylines. But they're independent storylines," Pitchford told the publication, stating the film isn't either Borderlands 1 or 2. Rather, it is "the first of the Borderlands Cinematic Universe", which means fans of the series will "see some characters from some of the different parts of what you might know from the video games".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the reports that Nintendo Switch 2 will now launch in 2025, later than its previously-expected arrival towards the end of this year.
Nintendo itself is yet to say anything certain about its inevitable Switch successor, but its steady path towards launch has been tracked by numerous reports. Now, we discuss how this latest news unfolded, why we believe it has happened, and what this means for Nintendo across the rest of 2024.
Plus: some fun speculation on what we hope Nintendo will change for its new hardware (get rid of Joy-Con stick drift, please?) With me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To borrow from Game of Thrones, Minter is coming (please read that in Ned Stark's voice). Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story - an interactive documentary experience for PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch - will release next month, on 13th March. 


Coming from Digital Eclipse, this upcoming release invites us all to take a little trip back in time, to "an era of cassette tapes, photocopied zines, and README.TXT", as it tells the story of the British game designer's career. So, expect plenty of psychedelia, radioactive sheep, mutant camels and more.  


Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story will include 42 classic games from across eight different platforms. An interactive timeline will reach all the way back to some of Minter's earliest work on the Sinclair ZX81 and Commodore VIC-20, before heading onto projects for the Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari 800, the Atari ST line of computers and Atari's Jaguar console of the 90s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After several years of silence, Little Devil Inside has resurfaced. You may need to cast your minds back to remember this one. Little Devil Inside first came to light - at least on Eurogamer - back in 2015, when the game achieved its Kickstarter funding goal, although trailers had floated about before then. 


Things then went quiet, before it popped back up in 2020 at a PlayStation 5 reveal event. The following year, we got word that Little Devil Inside would release towards the end of 2022, which evidently did not happen. 


Now, developer Neostream has re-emerged with its first Kickstarter post in four years and a new teaser for Little Devil Inside. The post reads a tad awkwardly, and I suspect it has been run through translation software before being published. However, it appears that there has been quite a lot happening behind the scenes at Neostream, with a some kind of disagreement happening between members of the development team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent patch for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has caused more issues than it fixed, fans say.
The game's most recent patch was released yesterday, with developer Rocksteady stating it would target "various crashes, progression blockers, connectivity issues and several server side improvements".
However, there are now numerous reports online of players encountering more issues than before. "The recent patches screwed the game, for a lot of people," one reddit user acknowledged when another player said their copy of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League now wasn't loading past a black screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi-Fi Rush will skip the current Nintendo Switch and instead arrive on the console's currently-unannounced successor. 
That's according to a report from Insider Gaming, which states that the absence of a Switch version of the game in yesterday's Xbox multi-platform announcement was due to it launching on Nintendo Switch 2 instead.


Whether Hi-Fi Rush could still eventually launch for the current Switch as well - perhaps at the same time? - is unclear, the report concluded.


Certainly, a launch for Hi-Fi Rush on a Nintendo platform has been expected. Earlier this year, in-game clothing designs seemed to point to the rhythm action game going multi-platform in the near future. This apparent tease preceded any other multi-platform plans being discussed publicly by Microsoft, and the decision to launch four games on other consoles ultimately being laid out this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree will be available digitally only, even for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S exclusive physical versions.


A Shadow of the Erdtree Edition will be released, including both the base game and the DLC. However this will only be available physically on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the expansion an additional download not on the disc. PC editions are digitally only, while PS4 and Xbox One will only have the DLC as a digital extra.


The DLC, as a standalone addition, will cost £34.99 across all platforms - a significant increase from, say, Bloodborne's The Old Hunters DLC that was £15.99 on release. This perhaps speaks to the size of Shadow of the Erdtree as much as the rising cost of games.

Dead Island 2 publisher Plaion has now confirmed the news, though in a blog post noted the game was "for Ultimate members". Users have noted that the game's PC version was not added to Game Pass for PC.


The unexpected addition to Game Pass follows a free weekend of access to Dead Island 2 via Xbox's "Free Play Days" promotion last week.

A new patch for the game has implemented a function that will now boot players back to the title screen if they have been idle for 15 minutes. This is something the community has been asking for a little while now, with many players reporting long queue times to get into the game.
Other points from this latest Helldivers 2 patch include a number of crash fixes. Players should no longer get stuck in the defrosting or in the ship intro cinematic, as well.

Carlos Santana (CS): Of course. My experience in deploying Kubernetes in production six

Prison Architect 2 - the sequel to the hugely popular 2015 original from developer Introversion Software (who sold the rights to Paradox in 2019) - was announced back in January, promising a take on the prison management formula reimagined in full 3D.


There was talk of some rather nifty looking multi-floor building, and a new connection system defining and impacting the relationships prisoners had with other inmates. All of that was originally due to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th March, but eager sorts will now need to wait until May following today's delay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidetaka Miyazaki didn't envision originating an entire genre. Yet such is the popularity of the Dark Souls games - right up to the more recent Elden Ring - that they've become collectively known in the gaming community as Soulslikes. That's shorthand for games with calculating combat, high levels of challenge and repeated death, though this is of course reductive of the awe and grim majesty Miyazaki's games evoke.


Soulslikes are everywhere now. From indie games utilising specific mechanics, to larger projects specifically trying to out-do FromSoftware at its own game. That's testament to the influence of Miyazaki's work, though he remains humble when discussing his oeuvre with me ahead of announcing the release of Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring's upcoming major expansion.


"We certainly didn't come up with the term Souslike and we didn't envision it as a new genre or a new term for the industry," he tells me. "So of course when it first started cropping up... we were very surprised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FromSoft boss Hidetaka Miyazaki has discussed the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, and the benefits of waiting for new hardware on which to revisit the beloved PlayStation 4 classic.


"It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans," Miyazaki told Eurogamer when questioned about the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, in an interview timed alongside today's proper unveiling of the Elden Ring DLC. "It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it."


But would a remake benefit from newer hardware to make the release worthwhile? FromSoftware's Demon's Souls, for example, was remade as a PS5 launch title after originally launching on PS3 - a double console generation leap that meant the re-release felt more significant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's February Direct Partner Showcase has come and gone. This presentation was focused around third-party games so, as expected, there was no news on any homegrown Nintendo titles or the Switch 2's expected arrival in early 2025. However, the broadcast was still full of annoucements for games headed to Nintendo Switch from other publishers over the coming six months. Here's a roundup of everything which appeared during the 25-minute show.
Fresh from Microsoft's confirmation it was bringing more of its Xbox console exclusives to other platforms, the show began with a look at Obsidian's Grounded - where you have to explore a massive garden as a tiny human. Grounded will support online cross-platform multiplayer on Switch when it's released on 16th April.
After this, we entered the dying world of Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist. You take on the role of Lilac as she explores the landscape alongside a homunculus (Fullmetal Alchemist vibes anyone?). Ender Magnolia Bloom will be released on the Nintendo Switch later this year.

Launching exclusively for Nintendo Switch on 25th June, this new entry in the series features an online mode where up to 16 players can rush forth simultaneously across obstacles and towards each level's goal. It looks rather like Fall Guys!


Another big change with Banana Rumble is the addition of a Spin Dash move, which lets you charge forward and skip over short gaps. There's a new co-op Adventure Mode, too, and the ability to customise your chimp with over 300 options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And just like that, my excitement for Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has gone from bubbling anticipation to a fever pitch scream; alongside a first gameplay trailer for FromSoftware's eagerly awaited expansion, publisher Namco Bandai has now shared a release date, confirming it'll be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 21st June.


But first that trailer, offering a full three-minute look at Shadow of the Erdtree, and the sprawling expanses of almost inevitable death and gleefully masochistic misery within. There are fields of wheat tainted with spectral tomb stones, gloomy swamps, and striking ruins high on hills - and what gameplay reveal trailer would be complete without a tease of the imposing enemies that'll no doubt be the cause of that aforementioned death and misery?


As for what it's all about, well, the specifics remain something of a mystery, although Miquella - long speculated to be the focus of the expansion - while not especially prominent in this reveal (possibly because he's currently stuck in an egg), does sort of appear, and there are further hints he's maybe not as benevolent as some might claim. Let the lore theorising begin!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Stories, Capcom's first - and wonderfully successful - stab at adapting the series' classic monster battling action into a family friendly turn-based RPG, is, as per today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, getting a Switch remaster sometime this "summer". Seperately, Capcom has confirmed it's coming to PS4 and PC too.


Switch owners have, of course, already had a chance to sample the Monster Hunter Stories series when its acclaimed second outing launched on Nintendo's platform in 2021. However, Nintendo's latest Direct has revealed the original game - first released for 3DS back in 2016 - is getting a thorough spruce-up for modern audiences.


Monster Hunter Stories 1 casts players as a Monster Rider, setting them loose in a colourful, cartoony rendition of the series' universe to indulge in some classic RPG-style questing and Pokémon-esque monster collecting, battling, and rearing - and very good it is too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following last week's long-rumoured announcement Microsoft is bringing four of its previously Xbox-exclusive first-party games to Switch and PlayStation 5, we've finally got official confirmation of the first two games making that multiplatform leap: Obsidian's historical narrative adventure Pentiment comes to Switch tomorrow, 22nd February, while inch-high garden adventure Grounded arrives 16th April on Nintendo's platform.


Starting with Pentiment, it cast players as Andreas Maler, a master artist who finds himself embroiled in murders, scandals, and intrigue over a period of five years in 16th century Bavaria. It's fantastic stuff - Eurogamer's Christian Donlan called it a "brilliant narrative adventure that is filled with intelligence and heart" in his Recommended review back in November 2022 - and the choice-driven adventure is paired with a striking art style, inspired by the great manuscripts and the earliest printed books of the time.


As for Grounded, Microsoft's second Switch-bound Xbox title, it's a wonderful co-op-imbued survival and crafting adventure with a distinctly 80s twist, taking a leaf out of cinema favourite Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. As in that movie, Grounded's four protagonists are miniaturised and left to fend for themselves in a sprawling backyard garden, building bases and crafting armour to forge ahead against deadly bugs, fish, and other wildlife.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox boss Phil Spencer has addressed lingering questions around the company stance on physical media following last year's leaks of an "adorably all-digital" Xbox Series X refresh, saying Microsoft continues to be "supportive" of the medium, and insisting "getting rid of physical, that's not a strategic thing for us."


An all-digital (and distinctly cylindrical) new Xbox Series X design first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year's court battle with the FTC over its Activision Blizzard acquisition plans. However, when Spencer later acknowledged the leak, he called its contents "old emails and documents", insisting that "so much has changed".


But still, the possibility of an all-digital new Xbox has continued to loom, whether that be a mid-cycle refresh or a future console, particularly following news of major layoffs acoss Microsoft's games retail teams. And Spencer has now shed a little more light on Microsoft's perspective on physical media as part of an interview for journalist Stephen Totilo's Game File.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring aficionados, it's finally almost time to unclench! Just shy of two years since the launch of FromSoftware's magisterial open-world action-adventure, publisher Bandai Namco has confirmed it'll be sharing more on the game's eagerly awaited DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, later today, with early rumours pointing to a June launch.


But first the confirmed stuff; over on its social media channels, Bandai Namco has formally announced Shadow of the Erdtree will be getting a first gameplay reveal as part of a three-minute long YouTube "presentation" today, 21st February, at 3pm UK time/4pm CET/7am PST.


And here we enter into less substantiated territory, with reliable Deallabs leaker billbil-kun (who has an impressive track record when it comes to accurately reporting unannounced PlayStation news) claiming Shadow of the Erdtree will launch on 21st June.

Her arrival in the game marks something of a full-circle moment for the global music megastar, after her social media post in October 2019 simply asking "What's Fortnite" went viral. Five years on, Lady Gaga's account reposted her original message today with an image of her upcoming in-game character model, and the correction: "*fortnite".


The image is labelled with Fortnite Festival, which is the game's Rock Band/Guitar Hero-style rhythm game mode that launched late last year. Festival's second season kicks off this Thursday, 22nd February, following its first season that spotlighted The Weeknd.

This includes the excellent Tales of Arise, the epic role-playing game from Bandai Namco's Tales studio that originally launched to a warm reception back in 2021. "There are missteps and a few bumps along the way, but this soft reboot of a long-running series emerges a triumph," we wrote in Eurogamer's Tales of Arise review.


Younger subscribers (or Xbox Game Pass owners with kids) will likely be keen to know that Bluey: The Video Game comes to the subscription this Thursday, 22nd February. You can explore the Heeler House and playground, plus play keepy uppy and Chattermax Chase.

A new CNBC report notes that there was now "broad concensus in the game industry that Sony is indeed preparing a launch of a PS5 Pro in the second half of 2024," quoting Tokyo-based games analyst Serkan Toto.


However, the report cautions that Sony is unlikely to see a large uptick in PS5 sales year-on-year as a result of the Pro's launch, and is also unlikely to cut the cost of the base PS5 model as a result. (Sony, unsurprsingly, has not commented on CNBC's report.)

"Surprise! We're still here," developer Criterion Games shared in a new blog post, where it detailed Need for Speed: Unbound's year two roadmap. "NFS turns 30 this year, and with that huge legacy, we couldn't stand idle. However, this year will be a bit different from the previous one."
The studio said it hopes players will make "new memories" with the Need for Speed series this year, but admitted it "can't build everything everyone wants right now". What it can do, however, is work with its community to decide what the series should look like in the future.

We first heard about this Warhammer 40K DLC last year, with the studio subsequently stating we could expect it to release sometime during Q4. This evidently did not happen, but the good news is that there isn't much longer to wait now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cult 90s sci-fi film Starship Troopers has had a bit of a renaissance of late, which has been attributed to the releases of Helldivers 2 on PlayStation and PC.
According to online TV ratings tracker Television Stats, the 1997 release has seen its viewership stats, Wikipedia rank, and IMDB rank all see a significant rise over recent days.
A quick browse through social media will see several posts linking this renewed interest in Starship Troopers with the release of Helldivers 2 earlier this month, and this hasn't passed the game director by. Sharing some stats on X showing an increase in Starship Troopers' popularity, Johan Pilestedt said: "This is incredible!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no room for mistakes in Assassin's Creed Mirage's new Full Synchronisation Challenge mode, which arrives in the game via a fresh update due today. 


The option essentially lets you try a permadeath run of the full game, which will end if main character Basim dies or commits any illegal actions (ie. killing civilians) that would normally see you kicked out of the Animus. 


Full Synchronisation Mode will become available when you install today's patch 1.0.7 for Mirage, which launches at around 1pm UK time.

The showcase will contain "exciting news", a post on social media today teased, without going into further detail. 


We're expecting to hear from The Pokémon Company on what the next Pokémon project to launch will likely be - and while it feels too early for a new generation of Pokémon, following 2022's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it seems likely that some sort of game will arrive in the next 12 months.

And let it be known, Larian used that time wisely, addressing both the current state of the industry and the importance of player experience. 


When Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse took to the stage, he acknowledged that while this is a "really human industry" it can also be very "bad sometimes at showing developers what they're worth". He then discussed the wave of layoffs that have affected so many people and game development studios over the past year.


"I want you all to know that you are talented and that you matter, and that you are the future of this industry. Don't let that flame be extinguished by our collective mistakes," Douse said. "I know everyone here is scared because shit's really fucked up."

I have looked into this further, and it turns out not only is Trinity the name of the military order in the rebooted Tomb Raider games, but it is also the code name for the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, which was conducted by the United States Army back in 1945. And that could be what the Tomb Raider website is referring to. Whoops! 

So, yes, the mention of Trinity on the Tomb Raider site may well be a coincidence that left the super fan in me a little too enthusiastic. Reader, I confess, I may have jumped the gun a bit here. I am going to send a message to the Tomb Raider team though and ask if they have any comment on the wording in the blog post, because my curiosity has now been piqued even more. 

The original story continues below.

"From the beginning to the middle of the release, there were network issues, lack of content, etc... We are truly sorry for the content that did not meet the expectations of many of you," Capcom's Japanese Street Fighter social media account shared over the weekend. 


This is something we touched on in our own Street Fighter 5 review from 2016. As we said at the time: "Street Fighter 5's brilliant combat is let down by a barebones launch and server troubles."

Eurogamer reported last Friday that Nintendo was now looking to launch Switch 2 in early 2025, a change from previous, unannounced plans that had the new console pegged for later this year. Sources with knowledge of the delay told us it was designed to ensure the strongest possible line-up of launch games.

Bloomberg later corroborated the news via its own sources, and today noted Nintendo shares had now fallen 5.8 percent on the back of Switch 2's delay being made public. Nintendo is yet to comment on the reports.

The mod in question added Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst as an in-game companion. And, of course, he brought some nu metal energy with him, as he only spoke in lyrics from the band's discography. All very standard modding community stuff.
However, the mod had a very short shelf-life on Nexus Mods when it was first released around seven years ago, and there was very little evidence of it left online - an old Reddit post and YouTube video (which you can see below), were about all that remained.

That's a new record for Helldivers 2, according to official Steam figures, and puts the game's all-time player peak  higher than Steam stalwarts such as GTA5, Rust and Destiny 2. 


To say that Helldivers has been a hit on PC would be something of an understatement, especially in comparison to the middling popularity of some other PlayStation PC launches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Convergence mod for Elden Ring is out now, offering an "exhaustive overhaul" of the game.


Available on NexusMods, The Convergence makes major changes from the very beginning of the game. Now players will need to choose from one of 27 new classes - each with its own unique progression path - that will determine the player's starting location in the world.



The original game features 10 classes, but these are starting points from which the player has freedom to develop in any direction. The Convergence, then, has a more formal structure for players to follow that cements typical builds.

Sega first announced it was making a long-awaited new Crazy Taxi title in December last year, as part of a new wave of entries in many of its classic series.


Now, a Japan Times interview has shed more light on its scope, and revealed it is being worked on in part by Sega's relatively new Sapporo Studio, which was founded in the capital of Japan's Hokkaido prefecture in December 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite claims it is a "quadruple-A" live-service experience, Skull and Bones's user Metacritic score has taken a pummelling since the pirate ship game was released on Friday, 16th February.
Based on the 222 user scores recorded to date, Skull and Bones' user score is sitting at just 2.8 out of 10, making it the lowest-rated game of 2024 released thus far when ranked by user score alone.
Complaints are centred chiefly around its "underwhelming and lacklustre" gameplay, a "poorly designed" end game, and claims that it is "boring", with many players comparing it unfavourably to Sea of Thieves and even Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, the latter of which is now 11 years old.

Designed for people who "love early console-era survival horror games with cinematic fixed camera angles and low-fidelity visuals", Heartworm is described as "a nostalgia-wrapped nightmare with a compelling narrative that tackles themes of grief and obsession, supported by a haunting soundtrack, surreal visuals, and pre-rendered cutscenes".
Heartworm developer Vincent Adinolfi had originally hoped to release Heartworm this year, but after losing its publisher, launching a Kickstarter, cancelling a Kickstarter, and then finding a new publisher in DreadXP, Adinolfi says "with the delays we have had there's no choice but to push things back - I hope you can understand".

"Despite our best efforts to increase server capacity to accommodate all of you who want to dive for Freedom, we are experiencing capacity issues," the team said in a statement posted to X/Twitter over the weekend.

"This emerging 'Palworld has lost X per cent of its player base' discourse is lazy, but it's probably also a good time to step in and reassure those of you capable of reading past a headline that it is fine to take breaks from games," Bucky said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 700 unionised Ubisoft employees working across the company's French studios have taken part in an organised day of strike action after annual salary negotiations collapsed.


The strike, organised by French game workers union STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo), took place on 14th February across Ubisoft's Paris, Montpellier, Annecy, Lyon, and Bordeaux studios. The STJV had called for action at the start of this month, saying annual salary negotiations had reached an unsatisfactory conclusion.


"In recent weeks," the STJV wrote in a statement shared at the time, "Mandatory Annual Negotiations on salaries have taken place in several Ubisoft entities in France, and the STJV was obviously present. Despite concerted efforts by union organisations to find an acceptable compromise, negotiations hit a wall."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A report claiming Nintendo Switch 2 will now launch in Q1 2025 is spreading online. 


Brazilian games journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe has stated Nintendo is now looking to release its next console in early 2025, though still within the 2024 financial year. The report is based on development sources now targeting that quarter for launch.


Eurogamer has heard similar whispers of an early 2025 launch from industry sources this week, though has not been able to concretely substantiate them. Nintendo Switch 2 had previously been widely tipped to arrive later this year. A move to the other side of Christmas into early 2025 would mean more time for the console's launch line-up to be readied, while keeping the financial benefit of Switch 2's launch within Nintendo's upcoming financial calendar.

Writing in a post shared on Steam, Pocketpair admitted that, while the studio has been "dealing with each issue on a daily basis and taking measures", there are "many cases where we are not able to keep up" with cheating and fraudulent activities - leading, it acknowledged, to "some players [being] unable to play the game properly."


Pocketpair apologised for "any inconvenience this may cause" and - expanding on a recent tweet promising a cheating-related patch "soon" - revealed it's currently working on a number of specific measures to deal with cheating and fraudulent activity "strictly and as a priority".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft's business update that brought us confirmation Xbox will launch four console exclusives - for now - on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.
But why did Microsoft choose not to name those four games (even though Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Grounded and Sea of Thieves were immediately reported to be the titles in question)? What happened to the previously-reported plans to include larger games such as Starfield? And where will Microsoft draw the line for what to launch elsewhere? Right now, these four feel like something of a soft launch for Microsoft's multiplatform strategy, 
As well as all that, we also discuss the news nuggets Microsoft dropped for the Xbox faithful - including mention of new Xbox console hardware this year and the proper next-gen Xbox that's still years away. With me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

That's according to Insider Gaming, which said the project was still in the early stages of development, but was a first-person shooter starring a Mandalorian bounty hunter during the time of the Galactic Empire.


The report stops short of confirming the Mandalorian bounty hunter as Din Djarin, star of Disney+ hit TV series and upcoming Mandalorian movie. A time period set during the height of the Galactic Empire would also place the game prior to the TV series - making a Baby Yoda appearance unlikely.

The information comes from the company's latest financial report for Q3 of FY2024, which  contained changes to its projections of profits and sales for the full fiscal year.
The Tekken 8 and Elden Ring publisher lowered its projections for profits due to "valuation losses". These losses include "loss on disposal of titles following a review of the composition of the titles within the next mid-term plan in mind", the company stated in its report.

Well, the update is now live, and with it comes the usual delight of patch notes a la Larian, which are too lengthy to be contained in Steam's character limit (of course).

Payday 3 hasn't exactly had the best of launches. It was plagued with matchmaking issues and online-only requirements on release, and subsequent patches were delayed. All this lead to developer Starbreeze admitting that sales and player activity were lower than it had hoped, but it would endeavour to turn this around with a series of prioritised improvements.
Now, we know more about what these upcoming improvements will be, thanks to the reveal of Operation Medic Bag. Here, the developer announced that an offline mode is coming to Payday 3, as well an overhaul to matchmaking (Starbreeze admitted that right now, "matchmaking isn't doing a good job of bringing people together"), tweaks to the UI, a solo mode and a quickplay option. Additionally, "challenges will be removed", with the developer stating it will "switch infamy progression to be tied to heist completion".

"I will say, when I look at a game like Helldivers 2 - and it's a great game, kudos to the team shipping on PC and PlayStation - I'm not exactly sure who it helps in the industry by not being on Xbox," Spencer told Game File. "If you try to twist yourself to say, like, somehow that benefited somebody somewhere.


"But I get it. There's a legacy in console gaming that we're going to benefit by shipping games and not putting them on other places. We do the same thing."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 is developer Remedy's fastest-selling game to date, but the studio is still to recuperate the project's development and marketing costs. 


In its latest financial report, Remedy said Alan Wake 2 had now sold 1.3m units, with 1m of those occurring by the end of last year. This equates to 50 percent more copies and over three times more digital copies of Alan Wake 2 sold in the game's first two months than its previous release Control managed in its first four months (though it's worth noting Alan Wake 2 was a digital-only release).


Control has since gone on to sell over 4m units, and Remedy said it expected a similar trend with Alan Wake 2, as "a great game can generate excellent long tail sales". But, of course, games lose value over time - so copies sold after prices drop generate less revenue than at launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has shared updated Game Pass membership figures for the first time since January 2022, saying the on-demand gaming service now has 34m "fully paid" subscribers, with "significant growth" coming from PC and cloud.


That update comes via Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer, speaking to journalist Stephen Totilo for his Game File newsletter (thanks VGC) ahead of this week's hotly anticipated Xbox 'business update' podcast - in which the company finally discussed its much rumoured plans to bring a number of its formerly Xbox-exclusive first-party games to PS5 and Switch.


Discussing Microsoft's latest Game Pass figures, Spencer assured Totilo the 9m subscribers added to the service since January 2022 - when Microsoft announced Game Pass had amassed a total of 25m members - were "fully paid" and did not include promotional players. "Those are people," Spencer reiterated, "fully paid subs."

That's according to Xbox president Sarah Bond, who was speaking on an "Updates on the Xbox Business" edition of the Official Xbox Podcast, alongside Microsoft Gaming boss Phill Spencer and head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty.


According to Bond, Microsoft has hardware plans for Xbox in both the short and longer term. Starting this "holiday", for instance, Microsoft will share "some exciting stuff coming out in hardware". An official Xbox tweet accompanying today's podcast expanded on Bond's comments, saying Microsoft currently has a "robust and innovative multi-year hardware roadmap" that'll include "more console and controller options...this holiday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following mounting reports Xbox is preparing for some kind of multiplatform future, Microsoft has confirmed it'll be bringing four previously Xbox-exclusive first-party titles to PlayStation 5 and Switch later this year, with more likely to come in the future.


Reports that Microsoft was preparing to release a number of first-party games on competing consoles - namely Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush - first surfaced at the start of this year, but it wasn't until last week's claims high-profile exclusives such as Starfield and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would also be going multiplatform that Microsoft broke its silence, promising to reveal more in a podcast this week.


And now, as reported by The Verge - which was pre-briefed by Microsoft ahead of tonight's reveal - Xbox gaming boss Phil Spencer has confirmed the company has "made the decision that we're going to take four games to the other consoles". Bafflingly, Spencer does not name the games directly, only saying two are community-driven titles and two are smaller games.

Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer, Xbox president Sarah Bond and head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty - the company's Triforce of gaming top brass - stopped short of officially confirming the quartet of titles set to go multiplatform, but reports online suggest those titles will be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves and Grounded.

The podcast also included a brief mention of new Xbox hardware launching later this year, and a tease for the proper next-gen Xbox - you can read all of that below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Post-apocalyptic RPG fans are in luck; the next batch of freebies coming to the Epic Games Store have been revealed, and two bonafide RPG classes - Fallout and Fallout 2 - have made the list alongside Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel.


Fallout 1 and 2, developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997 and 1998 respectively, have amassed a fiercely passionate following over the years, and with good reason. "From the unrelentingly bleak, darkly ironic tone to the novelty of the open-world, post-apocalyptic setting," Eurogamer wrote in 2011, "from the inspired, cerebral turn-based combat system to the immense degree of variety and personality in the character-customisation, the superbly-written quests and characters and the gallows humour that underpins the games without lessening their emotional impact, even the well-placed, gritty violence; there's very little about the games that doesn't command as much respect now as they did a decade ago."


As for Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, released in 2001, it's less widely revered, but still a decently enjoyable time, infusing the post-apocalyptic isometric wasteland setting of its illustrious RPG predecessors with squad-based combat action. And its inclusion means next week's Epic Games Store freebies list is as follows:

        <updated>2024-02-15T17:52:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quarter of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM's total workforce - approximately 24 employees - is reportedly facing redundancy following the cancellation of a standalone expansion for acclaimed RPG Disco Elysium, said to be "one to two years away from completion".


That's according to Swedish gaming content agency GLHF, which claims the cancelled expansion - codenamed X7 - was the third project to have either been canned or paused indefinitely by ZA/UM in as many years. A Disco Elysium sequel was reportedly cancelled in 2022 (complicating the claim, ZA/UM CEO was still talking about the project in June 2023, albeit saying it had been "jeopardised" following a messy tussle with its former creative leads), while a new sci-fi IP is said to have been paused in 2023.


GLHF, citing "sources close to the matter", says 24 employees at ZA/UM are now at risk of redundancy following X7's cancellation, with the job losses mostly affecting "the X7 team but also [its] non-development teams and non-X7 projects." Redundancies are set to impact employees in ZA/UM's UK offices as well as its EU studio, with writers, engineers, artists, animators, and staff in production and IT all affected.

With this update in action, users will be able to play games without being tied to their console even if they don't have a wireless controller to hand. This is as Xbox remote play now supports custom touch control layouts on the Xbox app (via iOS, Android and Windows devices) for over 100 games.
"The same custom touch layouts available through Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) will now be available when remotely playing games from your personal console," Microsoft said. "This includes games like Minecraft Dungeons, Psychonauts 2, Sea of Thieves, and many more. Additionally, a basic touch control layout can now be used for most other games."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been fairly quiet on the No Man's Sky front since its previous big update, Echoes, introduced the world to a mysterious new robot race known as the Autophages last August, but all that changes today with the release of its new Omega update - which coincides with a first-ever free weekend for the exploratory space sim on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.


No Man's Sky's Omega update introduces a handful of new core features, including on-planet missions. These procedurally generated quests can be initiated by speaking to alien lifeforms Travellers find roaming around on planet surfaces, and are assembled based on a number of factors, including locale, climate, and alien personality.


Elsewhere, the update makes it possible to captain an imposing Dreadnought capital ship - previously they existed mainly to be blown up - but this first requires a spot of successful space combat; players will need to defeat the pirate freighters surrounding a hostile Dreadnought during an encounter before they're able to board it and take control.

Bulletstorm VR had a broken release earlier this year, with players complaining about the port's botched physics and censorship, among other issues. Back in January, the team subsequently said it was "committed to improving the quality" of its release, and would be prioritising fixes based on their severity.
This new patch will provide fixes for multiple crashes and bugs, as well as improving the AI on select enemies. Other quality of life improvements, such as holding down the trigger to automatically skip a cinematic, have also been added.

However, the studio hopes to turn this around in the future, stating it will focus efforts "to ensure that the game lives up to expectations" for players.  
The developer noted there have been other examples of games that have successfully turned a "problematic initial time on the market" into a "long-term success" story. While Starbreeze did not mention any names, Cyberpunk 2077 came to my mind.
"There is no simple recipe available, but a common thread from the positive examples is to take players' criticism to heart, dare to support your game and keeping an open and honest dialogue with your stakeholders," Starbreeze said in its year-end report. "That is exactly what we are now doing with Payday 3."

<blockquote><p>The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this, there is a huge <i>attack surface</i> full of mediocre code. Efforts are ongoing to improve the quality of code itself, but many exploits are due to logic fails, and less progress has been made scanning for those. Meanwhile, great strides could be made by paring down just how much code we expose to the world. This will increase time to market for products, but legislation is around the corner that should force vendors to take security more seriously...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Totoki made the comments during an investor Q&A coinciding with its latest financial earnings report. When asked how Sony's gaming division might be looking to increase profits, he first discussed the difficulty of cost reduction in PlayStation hardware, given component pricing, before highlighting a "multiplatform" approach to its first-party game releases as a potentially more fruitful area of expansion.


"In the past, as you all know," Totoki explained, "we wanted to popularise [our] console, and the first-party title's main purpose was to make the console popular."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company is bringing its hugely popular Pokémon Center pop-up store back to London for four days this April, with promise of more exclusive Pokémon merchandise.


The Pokémon Center's return to the UK coincides with this year's Pokémon Europe International Championships, which take place at ExCeL London from 4th to 7th April. The store will be open at the venue from 10am to 8pm every day except Sunday, when it's set to close at 4pm.


Previous Pokémon Center pop-ups in the UK have attracted huge crowds, and The Pokémon Company is clearly expecting similar attention this time around. It notes that while entry to the store is open to the general public and won't require a competitor or spectator badge, reservations are mandatory - even for badged attendees. More information on the reservation process is set to be shared "closer to the event".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has unveiled its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium game catalogue additions for February, which this month include Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Need for Speed Unbound, The Outer Worlds, Tales of Arise, and more.


Assassin's Creed Valhalla is arguably the biggest biggie in there, whisking players away for a Viking adventure set against an open-world backdrop of Anglo-Saxon England at the end of the ninth century. A lavishly designed "saga for the ages", is what Eurogamer called it back in 2020.


Valhalla is joined by the developer Criterion's equally recommended arcade racer Need for Speed Unbound - the "best Need for Speed in a generation" we said when it released in 2022 - as well as Obsidian Entertainment's slightly less gripping 2019 satirical adventure The Outer Worlds, a "conventional, easygoing scifi RPG...that fades very quickly from the mind." And here's the full list of February's PlayStation Plus Extra games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 4 has partnered with model Winnie Harlow and added a range of Vitiligo skin details to the game as part of a free update. 


Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. This is caused by a lack of melanin, the pigment in skin. Sims 4 players will now be able to customise their Sims with Vitiligo skin details, with patches for the face, upper torso, lower torso, arms, and legs now available in the Create-A-Sim menu. 


These details are available for Sims of all ages, from infants to elders. Several Vitiligo patterns will have "more than one variant", the Sims team said, calling skin details an "important area of focus for the dev team as we remain committed to expanding representation in The Sims 4". Other skin features already in the game include birthmarks, stretch marks, scars, and freckles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect new games in any of PlayStation's biggest existing franchises before the end of this financial year, Sony has said. 


That means no new entry in the God of War or Marvel's Spider-Man franchises until at least April 2025, according to Sony president Hiroki Totoki. 


Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, currently listed with a vague "2025" release date, will therefore launch later than March. Don't expect to see other big PlayStation properties such as Uncharted, The Last of Us, Ratchet & Clank or Horizon before then, either. It's also unclear where a potential Ghost of Tsushima sequel fits in.

According to its latest financial report, Sony sold a further 8.2m PlayStation 5 consoles, bringing its lifetime total to 54.7m. That's 16.4m consoles sold this financial year so far.


However, Sony has dropped its expected sales forecast across its gaming segment for the year by five percent, due to an expected decrease in hardware sales and increase in losses due to promotions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team's CEO has said he understands the critism around the recent Silent Hill 2 Remake trailer, which didn't "capture the spirit of the game".
The trailer in question was a combat-focused marketing beat by publisher Konami, and as Matt said at the time, combat is not exactly the first thing you think of when you think of Silent Hill 2. It probably isn't even the second or third. And yet, this was what Konami decided to hone in on during PlayStation's recent State of Play.
However, reactions afterwards weren't exactly enthusiastic. "The nurse vaulting over the wall like it's a tactical shooter is hilarious," one comment under the original trailer reads. Another remarked the game looks more like it's from 2014, than 2024. Others said it looked more like a fan-made remake.

The message states that these depictions are "inexcusable" but have been kept intact to acknowledge their "deeply harmful" inclusion and learn from it.


There's no detail in the statement on which specific elements of the games it refers to - though one likely example can be found in Tomb Raider 3, Eurogamer fans of the games tell me, where stereotypical South Pacific islanders attack Lara Croft with bows and arrows.

<blockquote><p>In fact, throughout the entire book, Dixon fails to identify a <em>single</em> blockchain project that has successfully provided a non-speculative service at any kind of scale. The closest he ever comes is when he speaks of how &#8220;for decades, technologists have dreamed of building a grassroots internet access provider&#8221;. He describes one project that &#8220;got further than anyone else&#8221;: Helium. He&#8217;s right, as long as you ignore the fact that Helium was providing LoRaWAN, not Internet, that by the time he was writing his book Helium hotspots had long since passed the phase where they might generate even enough tokens for their operators to merely break even, and that the network was pulling in somewhere around $1,150 in usage fees a month despite the company being valued at $1.2 billion. Oh, and that the company had widely lied to the public about its supposed big-name clients, and that its executives have been accused of hoarding the project&#8217;s token to enrich themselves. But hey, a16z sunk millions into Helium (a fact Dixon never mentions), so might as well try to drum up some new interest!...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Lethal Company has become incredibly popular since its debut last year, and prompted praise for the game's mix of genuine horror and almost slapstick comedy. Now, it appears others are trying to profit off Zeekerss' success by releasing their own rip-off of Lethal Company on mobile. Don't be fooled.


Writing on the Lethal Company Discord, a moderator stated this mobile version "was made with no explicit permission and is most likely a scam". They asked users to refrain from linking to any fake games, to avoid anyone falling foul of "devious and malicious intentions that may be behind that operation".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Thaumaturge will now launch slightly later than planned, on 4th March, despite work on the game being complete. 


Writing on social media today, publisher 11 Bit Studios said it had actively chosen to delay the game due to "February's busy launch period". This month's releases include Ubisoft's Skull and Bones (on the 16th) and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (on the 29th). 


"The game is complete, but we want to give it space so it can be enjoyed the way we believe it deserves," the publisher wrote in a post on X. "See you in 1905 Warsaw and thank you for your patience!"

Benard worked on Dead Cells until late 2019, before establishing his own one-man studio called Deepnight. Now, he's posted his thoughts on Dead Cells' development being ended on the game's Discord server, after being asked for his opinion (as spotted by PCGamesN).
After a quick check by Eurogamer, Benard's posts no longer seem to be available on the server at the time of writing, though many users are still discussing what he wrote.

Rocksteady became aware of the bug when players began reaching Mastery Levels during the postgame "beyond our wildest expectations", the developer said on the Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Discord server.
"As Mastery levels increased, Burn's damage also increased," Rocksteady explained, adding this was not "what the game was balanced for at launch". The developer is fixing the scaling bug, it said, and once the fix is in place a new leaderboard will begin.

It's a familiar trope in many video games: essentially, developers indicate the correct path by adding bright yellow paint to scalable ledges and ladders.


It's also a debate that has raged for years. When the Resident Evil 4 remake demo was released, players complained about yellow paint being used on breakable objects. Now the discourse has erupted again.

However, the issues haven't been fully resolved and Arrowhead said it is "doing our utmost to make it right". "In order to do so," the studio added, "right now it is crucial that our team gets some sleep and we will be back at this again in a few hours".

That's according to Universo Nintendo, a Portuguese website that claims the Switch 2 will not only have backwards compatibility with Switch titles currently available on Nintendo's handheld system, but developers will also be able to "enhance" these games thanks to the additional processing power.
The report – which hails from the Portuguese podcast X do Controle by PH Brazil and was shared across social media by Centro Leaks – further asserts that rumours about a Nintendo Direct coming next week are indeed true, and claims that we'll finally have confirmation about Nintendo's badly-kept secret system at a hardware reveal event sometimes in March.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has confirmed that the "rapid patch" the team deployed to Steam yesterday is "now on PS5 as well".
The update comes after players lamented issues with matchmaking, as well as persistent crashes. There's also been criticism of the game's PC optimisation and its kernel-level GameGuard anti-cheat software, whilst others have taken umbrage with Helldivers 2's monetisation.
However, game director Mikael Eriksson did admit earlier today on the game's Discord channel that whilst "a full matchmaking solution is in works", it may take "a few more days" to test before it can be rolled out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8's upcoming DLC characters have reportedly leaked online.
A dataminer who sifted through the game files of the fighting game claims to have uncovered the names of some of those who are appearing on the DLC roster.
Dataminer Shootmans says they "confirmed and debunked several leaks" during the Closed Network Test, and attests that their most recent exploration has revealed who may be coming back for the DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software parent company, Kadokawa, has confirmed that whilst the team is "currently working hard" on Elden Ring's DLC, there is still no release date to share "at this time".
It seems questions about the progress of the eagerly-anticipated DLC were anticipated, as this latest update was included in the FAQ section of the firm's latest financial report.
Tucked in between questions about net sales for Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon ("we do not disclose sales results and forecasts for individual titles") and "the trend of pricing per unit for paper-based books", the company said that whilst work continued on Elden Ring's DLC, it was unable to provide a release date just yet.

Earlier this week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer called an all-staff townhall meeting to address the rumours suggesting that hitherto first-party Xbox games could be released on other platforms, insisting that this did not mean the company wasn't committed to the Xbox console.
According to journalist Shannon Liao, the meeting – which was held with all internal staff on Tuesday – confirmed that the company was indeed considering bringing first-party games to "multiple kinds of devices", and more would be revealed publicly next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld creator Pocketpair has acknowledged it is "overwhelmingly short" of developers to help the viral hit maintain momentum.
In a tweet posted to the company's Japanese-language X/Twitter account, the studio said it "still has a lot to do" and is looking for "people in all positions" who have experience in "any type of engine". Specifically, however, Pocketpair would like to talk to devs with expertise in project planning and engineering.
"At Palworld, we still have a lot to do, but we are overwhelmingly short of people to join us!" the studio said, as translated by PC Gamer. "We are looking for people for all positions, but we are especially looking for planning and engineers!
