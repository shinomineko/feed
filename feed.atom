        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends' 12th season, titled Defiance, is almost upon, and developer Respawn Entertainment's usual pre-release stampede continues this week with a new Defiance launch trailer, showcasing a little more of new hero Mad Maggie and teasing things to come.
Maggie was, of course, confirmed as Season 12's new hero earlier this week in her very own Stories from the Outlands animated introduction, and Respawn's new launch trailer picks up pretty much right where that left off, with Maggie being flown into the Apex Games, as decreed during her trial.

Death Stranding Director's Cut initially launched for PS5 last summer, introducing new story elements, a photo mode, expanded combat, new gadgets - including a laser gun and mounted machine guns - plus a variety of other tweaks to the original. Oh, and and it through in a fully featured racing mode too, because why not? The new PC version, incidentally, also features Xe Super Sampling and ultra-wide monitor support.

The original AI: The Somnium Files - which was the work of Zero Escape series creator and director Kotaro Uchikoshi - was a noir-ish murder mystery set in a technologically-advanced modern-day Tokyo. Nirvana Initiative, which once again sees Uchikoshi on scenario writing duties, retains the deductive premise of its predecessor but switches things up with a new pairing of protagonists and a new case to solve.

Hyper Scape made its debut in August 2020 after a short PC-only beta, where it was immediately met with a lukewarm reception - Eurogamer called it "as smart as it is generic". Less than three month later, Ubisoft announced it was embarking on a major overhaul of its 100-player battle royale experience so it could reach its "full potential".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With February (you may better know it by its more common name, Elden Ring month) less than a week away, it's time to do the subscription service additions dance once more. First up is PlayStation Plus, with Sony now confirming Planet Coaster, UFC 4, and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep as February's library additions.

It's a game that seeks to serve up a heap of classic theme park management action, but even speaking as a huge management sim fan that's happy to hoover up anything the genre has to offer, Planet Coaster comes up disappointingly short if you're looking for a tycoon game with mechanical depth and interesting strategic play. Where it shines, though, is in its immensely powerful creation tools, giving players everything they need to build some truly breathtaking parks and rides.

This isn't the first time we've heard that phrase, of course; Sea of Thieves executive producer Joe Neate also teased the multiplayer pirate adventure's "biggest year yet" ahead of 2021 - a claim that seems entirely reasonable in hindsight, given that last year saw Sea of Thieves introducing everything from a sizeable map expansion beneath the waves to a wildly cinematic Pirates of the Caribbean crossover.

Admission control is a key part of Kubernetes security, alongside authentication and authorization. Webhook admission controllers are extensively used to help improve the security of Kubernetes clusters in a variety of ways including restricting the privileges of workloads and ensuring that images deployed to the cluster meet organization’s security requirements.
However, as with any additional component added to a cluster, security risks can present themselves. A security risk example is if the deployment and management of the admission controller are not handled correctly. To help admission controller users and designers manage these risks appropriately, the security documentation subgroup of SIG Security has spent some time developing a threat model f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ABK Workers Alliance - a group of Activision Blizzard employees that has continued to push for major workplace reforms following last year's shocking reports detailing a culture of alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - has responded to today's news that Microsoft is buying the publisher, saying that while the move is "surprising", it does not change the group's goals.
The ABK Workers Alliance was established last summer, in response to a State of California lawsuit calling Activision Blizzard a "breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". Since then, the group has continued its mission to push for change at the publisher, launching a bid for unionisation, setting up a Strike Fund for employees, and calling for the removal (alongside the 1,800 employees that signed a related petition) of controversial CEO Bobby Kotick - who was said to have been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company "for years" in a damning Wall Street Journal report released in November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asmosdee's digital board game, Pandemic, has been quietly withdrawn from sale "for a multitude of reasons that [the publisher] cannot disclose".
Without formal announcement, Pandemic was delisted from Steam on 6th January, and it looks as though players can't pick it up on mobile devices now, either (although if you already own the game, you should be able to re-download it again from your library if you're quick). All signs of the game have been scrubbed from the company's website, too.

Right now, if your character dies and/or is left behind after the mission timer expires, you'll lose them, their blueprints, and their XP for good - a problem further compounded by server issues around the time the game launched last month, and an acknowledgement that some players may have not realised how death worked in the session-based survival game.

Asked if Sony's decision to begin porting its games to the platform was something championed by the Santa Monica team early on, Barlog, in conversation with GameInformer, suggested it was actually the developers across Sony's PlayStation Studios network that were ultimately instrumental in convincing the company to make the move to PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So far, Sega's had something of a rollercoaster relationship with NFTs, bursting forth fully enthused last summer before seemingly reining that excitement in more recently. However, its corporate machinations continue behind the scenes and new trademark registrations and logos have emerged revealing Sega's new gambit to potentially be called Sega NFT.
Sega first shared its interest in joining the NFT and blockchain throng last April, when it revealed it had partnered with Japanese company Double Jump Tokyo to begin selling the likes of visual art, in-game images, and background music based on its new and classic IPs in NFT form. It then repeated its enthusiastic stance as part of an investor briefing in November.

Researchers have developed a malware detection system that uses EM waves: &#8220;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485832.3485894">Obfuscation Revealed: Leveraging Electromagnetic Signals for Obfuscated Malware Classification</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: The Internet of Things (IoT) is constituted of devices that are exponentially growing in number and in complexity. They use numerous customized firmware and hardware, without taking into consideration security issues, which make them a target for cybercriminals, especially malware authors.</p>
<p>We will present a novel approach of using side channel information to identify the kinds of threats that are targeting the device. Using our approach, a malware analyst is able to obtain precise knowledge about malware type and identity, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques which may prevent static or symbolic binary analysis. We recorded 100,000 measurement traces from an IoT device infected by various in-the-wild malware samples and realistic benign activity. Our method does not require any modification on the target device. Thus, it can be deployed independently from the resources available without any overhead. Moreover, our approach has the advantage that it can hardly be detected and evaded by the malware authors. In our experiments, we were able to predict three generic malware types (and one benign class) with an accuracy of 99.82%. Even more, our results show that we are able to classify altered malware samples with unseen obfuscation techniques during the training phase, and to determine what kind of obfuscations were applied to the binary, which makes our approach particularly useful for malware analysts...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

When Steam Deck reservations first opened in July last year, Valve anticipated its hardware to begin shipping before the end of the year. Unfortunately, disruptions in production caused by a lack of available parts crushed those pre-Christmas dreams and Valve adjusted its planning, telling customers it expected first Steam Deck units to release in February this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With only a couple of months to go until the launch of Gran Turismo 7 - be still my heart that beats like a piston - Polyphony Digital is revealing some more of what to expect, including a return of an iconic circuit last seen in 2013's Gran Turismo 6. Which is to say that Daytona International Speedway is back.
You might know the circuit from its slightly fanciful appearance in Sega's Daytona USA, and while that game remains an all-time great I regret to inform you that the real thing isn't overlooked by a cliff with Sonic etched into its face, nor is there a playable slot machine on the bridge over the back straight.

That's according to a new report by VentureBeat's Jeff Grub, who shares a recent email circulated to store staff by senior management at UK retailer Game as an example of the move. "Stores have until the close of day Wednesday 19, January to remove all POS and ESD cards from all customer-facing areas and update their digital bays in line with this week's upcoming commercial update", the message reads.

Word of a new entry in the Twisted Metal series first emerged last September, when GamesBeat journalist Jeff Grubb claimed the project was in early development. Shortly after, reports suggested Destruction All-Stars developer Lucid Games had landed the gig and that this latest instalment would be turning the car combat series into a free-to-play game.

Shadow Man - which was based on Valiant Comics' Shadowman series and originally released for N64, PSone, Dreamcast, and PC back in 1999 - charts the adventures of Michael LeRoi, the latest in a line of voodoo warriors all adopting the Shadow Man moniker. The fondly remembered video game adaptation reimagines the comic book character's battle against the forces of darkness as a blend of third-person platforming, puzzling, and combat, playing out across both the real world and its terrifying counterpart, Deadside.

To celebrate that fact, Sony has now offered up its own list of last year's most popular games, as per the greatest number of downloads on its PlayStation Store - and of no huge surprise, FIFA 22 is at number one here in Europe.
Sony's official list is actually four lists spanning four different categories - the top paid PlayStation 5, PS4, and PSVR games, plus the biggest free-to-play games - and those are separated out again across two different territories: Europe and the US/Canada.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego has announced it is indefinitely suspending the release of its Overwatch 2 Titan set, initially scheduled to launch on 1st February, in light of ongoing concerns related to Activision Blizzard's workplace culture - which was described as a "breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women" in a California State lawsuit launched last July.
The controversy surrounding Activision Blizzard has only deepened since then; November saw the release of a damning Wall Street Journal report detailing further alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - with the publication levying particular criticism at CEO Bobby Kotick, claiming he'd been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across the company "for years".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, developer Techland attempted to stir up some additional excitement for the impending arrival of its parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel Dying Light 2 by claiming players would likely need to set aside "at least 500 hours" to fully complete the game. The statement perhaps didn't have quite the desired effect, however, drawing ire from skeptical fans, and the company has now offered further clarification, saying the game should only take around 20 hours to beat at its most fundamental level.
Techland initially made its 500-hour completion claim in a post to Twitter on Saturday, and following a less-than-stellar response to the news - some fans called the extended playtime off-putting - Techland attempted to allay concerns by clarifying the figure only applied when completing all the quests, endings, and exploring every part of the world. Regular players, it said, should "finish the story + side quests... in less than 100 hours".
