        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players hoping to get stuck into Techland's impressive Switch port of Dying Light have run into a pretty significant hurdle while trying to purchase the zombies-and-parkour shooter from Nintendo's eShop; the digital version is currently unavailable in the UK and across Europe as a result of Dying Light being banned from sale in Germany.
Switch players began flagging Dying Light: Platinum Edition's unexpected absence from eShop in multiple territories, despite its 19th October release date, over on Reddit. The mystery was eventually solved by an official Techland spokesperson, who explained the issue stems from the fact Nintendo's European eShop is registered in Germany - a country where Dying Light is currently unrated and thus prohibited from sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've found yourself tantalised by Ubisoft's upcoming extreme sports game Riders Republic, but not so much that you're quite ready to commit, you might like to get involved in the newly announced Free Trial week, giving players up to four hours with the full game ahead of launch.
Riders Republic, a spiritual successor to 2016's underrated Steep, expands on the open-world winter sports action of that game to usher in a fuller roster of activities. There's skiing, snowboarding, biking, and wing suits (of the vanilla and jet-powered varieties), playable both solo and competitively, with Ubisoft's heavily pushing the game's large-scale competitions for upward of 50 players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Valve unveiled a new compatibility ratings system for Steam Deck, intended to give users a clear indication of how well specific Steam games will run on the upcoming portable gaming PC. And now, a new beta update for Half-Life 2 has been discovered, seemingly released to ensure the seminal FPS meets the requirements needed to earn Steam Deck's top-tier Verified compatibility badge.
Half-Life 2's new beta branch update, as spotted and detailed by Valve watcher Tyler McVicker on YouTube, reportedly covers a surprising amount of ground, not only making adjustments to the way the UI and resolution are handled in-game - primarily to ensure Half-Life 2 fits Steam Deck's aspect ratio and remains legible at the machine's relatively diminutive size - but addressing some long-standing bugs as well.

<blockquote><p>WWS Sector cyber intrusions from 2019 to early 2021 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In August 2021, malicious cyber actors used Ghost variant ransomware against a California-based WWS facility. The ransomware variant had been in the system for about a month and was discovered when three supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) servers displayed a ransomware message.
<li>In July 2021, cyber actors used remote access to introduce ZuCaNo ransomware onto a Maine-based WWS facility&#8217;s wastewater SCADA computer. The treatment system was run manually until the SCADA computer was restored using local control and more frequent operator rounds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the Analogue Pocket set for release later this year, some new details about the device and future Analogue products has surfaced with the reveal of Analogue OS. Moving away from the basic but functional menu design of prior products, Analogue OS seems to be focusing on bringing quality of life features that could greatly enhance the overall experience.
The library feature is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects. This database of information, accessible directly from the device, was seemingly curated with the goal of identifying any and all variants of a game. For games which have had dozens of revisions, including different regions, the library can provide all relevant information. This could even help identify pirate carts as simply inserting the game into the unit will provide information about that specific cartridge. Knowing how common pirated Game Boy cartridges have become, this could become a quick way to identify legit carts for collectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took mere moments for Xbox Series X to enter the pantheon of memes following its December 2019 reveal, when its less-than-delicate heft was widely and enthusiastically compared to a refrigerator. Two years on, the meme still lingers and Microsoft has announced you'll be able to pre-order your very own official Xbox Series X mini fridge starting next Tuesday.
Microsoft initially embraced the Xbox fridge meme (with considerably gusto) last October, when it sent real Xbox Series X fridges - 6-foot, 400 pound, 1:1 scale replicas of the console - out to influencers and rapper Snoop Dogg. The gag was resurrected once again this March when Microsoft produced some mini fridge variants of the full-sized design to use as prizes in a promotion for Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's new energy drink.

As reported by Spanish website Vandal, several former MercurySteam employees recently took to the internet to query their names being omitted from Metroid Dread's credits, despite being involved in the production of the title. "I would like to sincerely congratulate the Metroid Dread team for putting out such an outstanding game," wrote 3D artist Roberto Mejías on LinkedIn. "I'm not surprised of the quality of the game though, since the amount of talent on that team was through the roof. I know this first hand because, despite not being included on the game's credits, I was part of that team for for eight months."

Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, a sequel to developer Troika Games' much-loved 2004 cult-classic RPG, was announced back in 2019 with a PC and console release expected the following year. Sequel-starved fans were delights at the news, particularly after it was confirmed Troika's Brian Mitsoda would assist with writing duties - but first hints of development troubles surfaced later that year when Hardsuit announced the first of several delays.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved stunning realism, fooling even human observers. Indeed, the popular tongue-in-cheek website http://thispersondoesnotexist.com, taunts users with GAN generated images that seem too real to believe. On the other hand, GANs do leak information about their training data, as evidenced by membership attacks recently demonstrated in the literature. In this work, we challenge the assumption that GAN faces really are novel creations, by constructing a successful membership attack of a new kind. Unlike previous works, our attack can accurately discern samples sharing the same identity as training samples without being the same samples. We demonstrate the interest of our attack across several popular face datasets and GAN training procedures. Notably, we show that even in the presence of significant dataset diversity, an over represented person can pose a privacy concern...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, EA shared the surprise news it's currently "exploring the idea of renaming" its long-running FIFA football series - and we might now know why; a new report claims the football association wants EA to pay "more than double" its current deal to continue using its licence.
According to the New York Times, the current ten-year agreement between EA and FIFA comes to an end in 2022, and negotiations to extend that deal are due to conclude this year. However, "at least two years of talks" are said to have now stalled as the two parties struggle to agree on specifics, with FIFA wanting to increase the cost of its licence by "more than $1 billion for each four-year World Cup cycle" - perhaps eager to capitalise on the exponential growth of Ultimate Team, which made EA $1.62bn in its 2021 financial year, mostly through FIFA.

<blockquote><p>Cloudflare was <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.339512/gov.uscourts.cand.339512.1.0.pdf">sued in November 2018</a> by Mon Cheri Bridals and Maggie Sottero Designs, two wedding dress manufacturers and sellers that alleged Cloudflare was guilty of contributory copyright infringement because it didn&#8217;t terminate services for websites that infringed on the dressmakers&#8217; copyrighted designs&#8230;.</p>
<p>[Judge] Chhabria noted that the dressmakers have been harmed &#8220;by the proliferation of counterfeit retailers that sell knock-off dresses using the plaintiffs&#8217; copyrighted images&#8221; and that they have &#8220;gone after the infringers in a range of actions, but to no avail &#8212; every time a website is successfully shut down, a new one takes its place.&#8221; Chhabria continued, &#8220;In an effort to more effectively stamp out infringement, the plaintiffs now go after a service common to many of the infringers: Cloudflare. The plaintiffs claim that Cloudflare contributes to the underlying copyright infringement by providing infringers with caching, content delivery, and security services. Because a reasonable jury could not &#8212; at least on this record &#8212; conclude that Cloudflare materially contributes to the underlying copyright infringement, the plaintiffs&#8217; motion for summary judgment is denied and Cloudflare&#8217;s motion for summary judgment is granted.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The Cluster API community is happy to announce the implementation of ClusterClass and Managed Topologies, a new feature that will greatly simplify how you can provision, upgrade, and operate multiple Kubernetes clusters in a declarative way.
A little bit of context…
Before getting into the details, let's take a step back and look at the history of Cluster API.
The Cluster API project started three years ago, and the first releases focused on extensibility and implementing a declarative API that allows a seamless experience across infrastructure providers. This was a success with many cloud providers: AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, GCP, Metal3, vSphere and still counting.
With extensibility addressed, the focus shifted to features, like automatic control plane …]]></summary>

Why Duplicate Data?
It’s convenient to create a copy of your application with a copy of its state for each team.
For example, you might want a separate database copy to test some significant schema changes
or develop other disruptive operations like bulk insert/delete/update...
Duplicating data takes a lot of time. That’s because you need first to download
all the data from a source block storage provider to compute and then send
it back to a storage provider again. There’s a lot of network traffic and CPU/RAM used in this process.
Hardware acceleration by offloading certain expensive operations to dedicated hardware is
always a huge performance boost. It reduces the time required to complete an operation by orders
of magnitude.
