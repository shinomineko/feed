        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has discussed the future of Fall Guys, following today's announcement that its game assets, animations and characters are coming to Fortnite's UEFN creative mode. 


Players will be able to make and play their own custom Fall Guys levels in Fortnite from May, Epic Games announced today during its State of Unreal presentation. Lego and Rocket Racing game assets arrive in UEFN today, meanwhile.


Speaking to Eurogamer, Epic Games executive vice president Saxs Persson said the addition of Fall Guys characters and gameplay to Fortnite will benefit players by the nature of it being accessible from within Fortnite, where millions play already. That said, the original Fall Guys game will also still continue on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves is celebrating its sixth anniversary today, 20th March, and to celebrate, Rare has given an unprecedented look at the year ahead for its multiplayer pirate game, with 2024 bringing the likes of windy horns, roaming warships, and portable grappling guns that let you whizz around the place with giddy abandon.


ALl this new stuff starts spewing forth with the arrival of Season 12 on 30th April, which marks the first time Sea of Thieves has received new weapons since the game's launch back in 2018. First up, there's the new double-barrelled flintlock, designed for shorter-range combat, which is capable of rapidly firing two shots individually before a reload is required. Alternatively, both shots can be fired simultaenously for a more powerful attack.


That's joined by the new throwing knife, which has a couple of different uses. It can give an opponent a quick (if not particularly powerful) stab, or it can be charged up to release a high damage attack that's particularly deadly if you can sneak up behind an enemy. And it won't surprise you to hear throwing knives can also be thrown to damage opponents at long distances. They'll also become embedded in environmental geometry, and you'll need to retrieve them to reload - unless your opponent gets there first and uses your blade against you.

The show's highlight was its peek at Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, Hennig's highly-anticipated World War 2 superhero game, which is built in Unreal Engine and shows off its latest features - including improved Nanite tesselation to make high-quality 3D geometry more memory efficient, and photo-realistic character animation using MetaHumans.


A preview build of Unreal Engine 5.4 launches today, ahead of its full release in late April. This adds Motion Matching that allows for simple AAA-quality character animation. Epic also demonstrated how Fortnite creators will be able to build custom Lego and Rocket Racing mini-games.

The trailer itself is quite the spectacle, something Hennig said was all possible thanks to the Unreal engine. The game uses Epic's MetaHuman Creator, and hoo boy it's impressive. The detail on Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's characters is really quite remarkable. Speaking following the trailer, Hennig herself called the detail in each character "insane".


"Working with the MetaHuman process, we have been able to honour our amazing actors' performances and faithfully transform them into equally powerful digital performances," Hennig said. You can check out the latest trailer for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra in the video below.

In the studio's recently published financial results, Remedy said its revenue fell to €33.9m, posting an operating loss of €28.6m. This is even with the launch of Alan Wake 2 in October, which is yet to recuperate its development and marketing costs.
Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said this decline was due to "increased investments" in the studio's games, as well as the "impairment charge related to Codename Vanguard". This was the studio's free-to-play co-op multiplayer game, which it rebooted and renamed Codename Kestrel in November last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games has issued a fresh update for Red Dead Redemption 2 - the game's first meaningful patch in 18 months. But, to the disappointment of fans, there's sadly no new content and no sign of any visual upgrades for players on newer console hardware.


Title Update 1.32 is available to download for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game, and includes "general fixes" for Red Dead Online plus a list of general bugs that have been squashed. Voice chat now defaults to off, patch notes state. On PC, there's now support for HDR10+ Gaming on compatible displays.


Rockstar's previous major patch for the game - Title Update 1.31 - was the last to add new content. It launched in September 2022, with just a handful of minor maintenance updates since. Even before then, Red Dead players had complained about its small dollops of DLC in comparison to the far larger expansions that regularly shipped for Rockstar's hugely-profitable GTA Online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Advertising Standards Authority has upheld complaints against EA, Jagex, and Miniclip for failing to disclose the presence of loot boxes in their adverts.
The complaints were filed to the ASA by researcher Leon Y. Xiao, who has previously conducted studies on the effectiveness of Belgium's loot box ban and the consistency of loot box warnings on games.
Xiao's complaints challenged ads by EA, Jagex and Miniclip for being "misleading because they omitted material information" - the presence of loot boxes - in paid promotions on Facebook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection did not have a good debut. On its release, players were met with a myriad of bugs and limited servers for each platform, resulting in many asking for a refund. The collection currently sits with an "Overwhelmingly Negative" review average on Steam.
Aspyr acknowledged the poor launch state soon after the collection was released, stating it had "experienced critical errors", and would work to address the many issues. Now, it is starting to make good on that promise, with the first patch for its Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection.
This patch aims to address a multitude of issues across multiplayer, audio and visuals, many of which really should have been ready at launch. It  is available now for those on Steam, with Aspyr saying it is still in the submission and certification process for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 developer Bungie has announced Onslaught, a new horde mode for the game. The offering is set to arrive for all players on 9th April, as a core component of Destiny 2's upcoming Into the Light update.


Onslaught is a three-person wave-based activity set on a selection of familiar but slightly-tweaked Crucible maps, where you and your allies must defend a war asset from taking too much damage. The aim is to protect the asset and keep each other alive for as long as possible.


Between waves, you can quickly acquire and place down a series of defensive options, including turrets, tripwires, and - brilliantly - a decoy Sweeper Bot, which will happily soak up bullets while tidying away debris.

Bungie designer Christopher Barrett was previously leading the project - described as a "sci-fi PvP extraction shooter" - but when reports began circling that he was no longer in the role, Joe Ziegler took to social media to confirm he was now in the game director's chair for Marathon.


"For the last nine Months I've been working on Marathon as the game director," Ziegler wrote in a post on Twitter/X. "We're still baking, but I’m excited to share with you more info on the game as we get closer and closer to bringing it to all of you."

Plunderstorm arrives alongside World of Warcraft's 10.2.6 content update as a limited-time event accessible for the "next several weeks". It sees up to 60 players - either playing solo or as a Duo with a friend - scouring the Arathi Highlands to locate abilities, upgrades, and loot in a bid to be the last pirate standing each 10-15 minute match.


"Discover lootable spells, abilities, and upgrades as you plunder treasure chests and defeat enemies," Blizzard explains in its announcement post. "Upon picking up, spells and abilities are automatically added to your Action Bar, with two slots dedicated to offensive skills and two for utilities such as leaps, speed boosts, and crowd-control. Some abilities are more action-based and require good positioning and player targeting."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley's long-awaited 1.6 update - which creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone at one time warned wouldn't "be huge", a comical assertion in hindsight - is finally here on PC, and it's accompanied by some an absolutely gargantuan patch notes.


Barone confirmed he was working on a 1.6 update for Stardew Valley back in June 2022, but warned fans it would be relatively modest in scope and 'mostly modding-focused'. As time has gone on, however, and more features have been teased by Barone, it's become increasingly obvious 1.6 has grown considerably more ambitious than was initially planned.


It's only now, though, with 1.6's arrival - and the release of its accompanying changelog - that we can see exactly how much work has gone into the update. Prior to today's patch notes, Barone had teased a number of new additions, including one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and crafting recipes, new dialogue lines, a new farm type, new late-game content, winter outfits for villagers, a new larger chest, 8-player co-op on PC, and - most importantly of all - hats for cats and dogs.

That's according to Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller, speaking in a new developer update video. Starting with the introduction of Overwatch 2's next hero, Venture, in Season 10, all heroes be free at launch, and that change is retroactive, meaning all previously released heroes will also be immediately available to players, no battle pass required.


The only requirement is players must first complete Overwatch 2's tutorial, if they haven't already done so, in order to unlock the game's original roster of heroes. After that, all new characters will become available for play.

The Go programming language has played a huge role in the
success of Kubernetes. As Kubernetes has grown, matured, and pushed the bounds
of what "regular" projects do, the Go project team has also grown and evolved
the language and tools. In recent releases, Go introduced a feature called
"workspaces" which was aimed at making projects like Kubernetes easier to
manage.
We've just completed a major effort to adopt workspaces in Kubernetes, and the
results are great. Our codebase is simpler and less error-prone, and we're no
longer off on our own technology island.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon has released a new video teasing its upcoming Fallout TV adaptation, which appears to follow up an initial snippet seen last week.
This scene shows lead actress Ella Purnell as the sweet and somewhat naive Vault Dweller Lucy as she attempts to de-escalate a conflict with Walton Goggins' Ghoul.
While Lucy remains steady and tries to use her words to appease The Ghoul, he is clearly unconcerned by her efforts. In fact, he seems to be amused by her attempts to drug him with a laced projectile. Before he can do anything though, a member of the Brotherhood of Steel - presumably Aaron Moten's Maximus - turns up in his Power Armour Suit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much the same as last year, AI remains the talk of the town at GDC 2024. Roblox Studio has announced a new generative AI-based character creator. Graphics card manufacturer Nvidia unveiled a new AI-powered chip, sending its stock price skyrocketing. And behind closed doors, Ubisoft demonstrated something of its own to a small collection of the press: a partnership with Inworld AI to create a prototype for "Newly Evolving NPCs", or NEO NPCs as Ubisoft calls them.
It's important to stress the "prototype" factor here. At the event, Ubisoft gave a brief presentation explaining the origins of its research team - led by Ubisoft Paris and a supporting Ubisoft Production Technology crew - and its goals, often referring to the project as an "experiment". After this I had a chance to sit down and actually "play" three, roughly 10-minute long demonstrations of the technology in action within a hypothetical game scenario. But while these demos were technically playable, they were explicitly described as an "independent proof of concept" for now. In a brief panel discussion after the hands-on time, Mélanie Lopez Malet, senior data scientist on the R&D team, said they were only just "scratching the surface... implementation [in a real game] for me is not even on my radar."
Still, this is one of the first working examples of generative AI being used in an actual, player-facing role from any major studio - and it does work. Sort of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has discussed the company's strategy of experimenting with generative AI, as detailed in today's announcement of NEO NPCs - a new prototype project from Ubisoft designed to let video game characters respond with custom responses to players' speech input.


Speaking at a press briefing for the NEO NPC project held at GDC this week in San Francisco, attended by Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell, Guillemot likened Ubisoft's experimentation with generative AI to some of its other early bets on emerging technology, like Xbox's camera Kinect and Nintendo's motion-controlled Wii. 


Asked whether Ubisoft was sometimes too early with taking up new tech, Guillemot responded: "It's not always too early. Sometimes, you are right. But being able to adopt the Wii early was a good move because we were able to do things we couldn't do before. Kinect was also very interesting, because it gave us a chance to create new experiences that were very reactive. We created Just Dance with the Wii.

This project is from the same team that brought us Aleph One, an open source engine built for current systems based on the Marathon 2 source code (meaning you can access Marathon, Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity elsewhere, but not yet on Steam).
While the team has promised Classic Marathon on Steam will be an authentic experience, there are of course a few extra bells and whistles to bring this revival up to more modern standards. For example, there will be optional widescreen HUD support and 60+ fps interpolation, which will improve the smoothness of the animation over the original without breaking the game logic. This is "just in case the original is too authentic," the Classic Marathon team said.

It's intended to be used during the pre-release phase of game development, such as internal builds, closed betas, or review copies. Being able to trace down sources of leaked content "makes potential leakers think twice", Irdeto said in a press release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has launched Steam Families - a streamlined, enhanced version of its existing household game sharing tools - and it's available for testing now in public beta form.


Steam Families combines and replaces features previously available through Valve's Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View tools, and creates a way for up to six family members to share a combined games library - consisting of titles (including owned DLC) from across each member's individual library - that can be accessed at any time, with a few provisos.


The big caveat to all this is that games are only eligible for sharing if their developer hasn't chosen to opt out of the Steam Families scheme - but once that particular roadblock is cleared, the only other key restriction is that a single owned copy of a game can only be played by one person at any time. If multiple people want to play the same game simultaneously, multiple versions of that game must be purchased and available in the shared library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GOG has announced a new partnership with Amazon Luna that'll let its customers play the games they own across a range of supported devices via cloud streaming, starting "soon".


As detailed in its announcement post, GOG's cloud gaming partnership means it'll be possible to play supported GOG purchases across iOS, Android, PC, Mac, and Fire tablets, with no download required beyond the Luna client. Games can be played using any Luna-compatible peripheral, which includes keyboard and mouse, as well as Xbox One and PS4 controllers.


All GOG Galaxy features will be supported when playing via Luna - including cloud saves and achievements - and the company notes its new streaming option won't impact any existing GOG benefits, meaning the likes of DRM-free downloads will still be available via GOG. Additionally, it'll be possible to make GOG purchases directly from within the Luna client, with those purchases then reflected back in GOG libraries to download in the usual way.

Named Dark Souls: Archthrones, it's been created by Archthrones Team and is available on NexusMods for free. The team comprises concept artists, writers, programmers, composers, and voice actors within the Souls community, according to its description.


Interestingly, it takes its cue from Demon's Souls in terms of level structure - hence the mod name being a play on the Archstones of FromSoftware's first Souls game.

Leaks have sprouted from early copies repeatedly being livestreamed online over the past few days, as well as details of the game's various trophies and achievements.

Dragon's Dogma 2 is set to release on 22nd March across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. If you fancy your own slice of the game ahead of then, you can jump into its character creator to get yourself ready for launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI may seem like something of a dirty word at the moment, but 62 percent of studios are using AI at some point during game development.


That's according to a new report by game engine maker Unity, which reveals that more and more development studios are adopting AI tools to make time and efficiency savings.


In 2022 the average time to launch for games was 218 days; now it's 304 days, the report states. 71 percent of studios responding to the survey said AI had improved their delivery and operations, to reduce that time to launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leaked specifications for Sony's unannounced PlayStation 5 Pro console have been posted online, and show the upgrades present in the souped-up console expected to launch later this year. 


Eurogamer understands these specifications - first reported on YouTube by Moore's Law is Dead - to be legitimate and sourced from Sony's own internal developer network, to which numerous partners have access to. The specs have since been reported on and also corroborated by Insider Gaming and IGN.


As you'd expect, the specs show a boost to the PS5 Pro's system memory and GPU. The machine's CPU remains identical to the base PS5, but now boasts a 'High CPU Frequency Mode' which is said to add a 10 percent speed increase, albeit with a slight one percent reduction to GPU performance.

Evidence of the planned feature was first found by app researchers, with images shared by Nima Owji revealing in-app titles named Blueprint, Crossclimb, and Queens. The idea is that companies will be ranked on leaderboards based on their collective employees' scores.
LinkedIn's planned games look to be simple, short games which can be completed in a few minutes, similar to The New York Times' Wordle or Connections. Going off the images alone, Queens looks like Picross with an extra constraint added, while Blueprint looks like a simpler version of the first round in Only Connect where you need to guess what connects a number of clues.

The North America finals of the EA-run Apex tournament saw players Noyan "Genburten" Ozkose Phillip "ImperialHal" Dosen getting hacked mid-game.
As recorded in clips of the matches, Genburten was suddenly able to see the positions of all players. "I'm getting hacked," he repeated, before leaving the game. ImperialHal, meanwhile, was given an aimbot during a match. Once he realised, he told his teammates and decided to finish the game without shooting.

Last month, Colossal Order boss Mariina Hallikainen admitted the developer's "biggest regret" was being unable to offer modding support for the game back at its launch last October. Fans had immediately criticised the title for failing to allow mods - a huge part of the original Cities Skylines - as well as it suffering from performance issues.

To quickly recap the situation, Ironmace - the Korean developer behind the mediaeval looter - had its office searched after allegations the studio created its game with stolen code. Ironmace was served a cease-and-desist letter and a DMCA takedown by Nexon, the fellow Korean games company where several Ironmace employees used to work. As a result, Dark and Darker was removed from Steam and Ironmace went on to use ChatGPT in a bid to prove it hadn't infringed any copyright claims.
Dark and Darker then came back online in early access last August, with Ironmace having created its own launcher, known as Blacksmith. Then, in January of this year, a court ultimately dismissed Nexon's request for an injunction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A modder who believes their uncredited work was included in Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection says the whole experience has been a "gut-punch".
Although developer Aspyr had insisted that the Collection "does not include any code or content that is taken from uncredited sources", modder iamashaymin found their mod had not only been included in the Collection's debut trailer – something Aspyr said was done "mistakenly" – but also in the final game, too.

At the end of February, Lehto confirmed he had left EA "on my own accord", and would now take time away from video games to work out "what, if anything, I want to do next". The director later admitted feeling "gut-punched to see EA lay off my team. So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise".
In the latest statement posted to X/Twitter, Lehto simply said: "Not been saying much here since I don't have anything positive to say about EA, my recent departure, and how so many, including my team, are suffering due to the industry sweeping layoffs".

As detailed in an announcement posted to Twitter/X yesterday, we now know that Ashley Johnson – perhaps known best as The Last of Us' Ellie – will be voicing "Purple", The Lord of the Rings' Elijah Wood will play "Green", Fresh of the Boat's Randall Park will portray "Red", whilst Community's Yvette Nicole Brown will voice "Orange".
Red – "Captain of the Skeld" – is described as a blowhard people-pleaser, whilst Purple is the suspicious and sarcastic chief of security. Wood's Green is an unpaid intern who's just "happy to be there", and Brown's Orange is a spineless corporate shill from HR.

Confirmation of a photo mode in Hellblade 2 came via Ninja Theory's social media channels, with the announcement being accompanied by four new images of the game taken using the same in-game camera that'll be available to players. And yes, it still looks bloody lovely.


There's not much more to report on the photo mode front, alas, leading us back to Microsoft's most recent news dump, in which it confirmed Hellblade 2's May release date alongside word the $49.99 digital-only release would be similar in length to the first game.

Hyper Light Breaker was announced all the way back in March 2022 and was originally expected to launch into early access the following spring. However, it's been hit with multiple delays since then, with its release first shifting to autumn 2023 before it was pushed back to a non-specific point in 2024 so Heart Machine could "bring the game to its full potential".


But now, speaking to IGN, the studio has confirmed Hyper Light Breaker will launch on Steam this summer, where it's expected to remain in early access for roughly a year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Mojang has warned anyone playing Minecraft through the Xbox app on PC not to download its latest update as it could cause their worlds to disappear.


That warning comes via Mojang's official Minecraft service status social media account, which writes, "Do not update Minecraft through the Xbox app on PC. If you do, your worlds may be lost." Mojang instead recommends players first run the Gaming Services Repair Tool for PC, accessible through the PC app, before installing the new update.


Minecraft's Game Release Known Issues page takes the explanations a little further, saying that using the repair tool will update Microsoft's Gaming Services to version 19.87.13001.0, which will avoid the update error, and presumably prevent all resulting world-snuffing mayhem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a while since we last heard from Commandos: Origins, developer Claymore Game Studios' revival of the classic WW2 real-time stealth-tactics series, but it's back to show off some of the locations players will be tensely sneaking around in a new trailer.


Commandos, should you be in need of a quite mental refresher, first surfaced in 1998 with launch of original developer Pyro Studios' first series entry, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines - a notoriously tough, if undoubtedly excellent isometric WW2 adventure in which players took charge of a six-strong team of commandos to complete the likes of sabotage and assassination missions, all while staying as stealthy as possible.


Five more series instalments followed, with Commandos eventually fizzling out with 2006's first-person effort, Commandos: Strike Force. Until, that is, last year's announcement of Commandos: Origins, which sees players experiencing the events that led to the formation of the titular squad as they travel from European coastlines to icy Arctic plains and African deserts - all presented using the series' classic isometric perspective.

We heard confirmation of a second Mario film this week, though notably it was not confirmed this would be "The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2". Mario and friends will return, of course (the first film's billion dollar box office  guaranteed that), but Nintendo was typically coy around what exactly this follow-up will focus on.
Donkey Kong? Daisy? Yoshi? Birdo? We get our thinking Cappy's on to theorise where the Mushroom Kingdom's story might go next, and whether this is all leading to some kind of Avengers-esque Super Smash Bros. team up movie. Or, alternatively, whether none of this really matters as it's just a light-hearted film for families. With me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

The sword replica is a metre and a half long and is made of resin, so hopefully isn't as heavy as it looks. And of course it's painted in brilliant, magical blue.


And while it's perfect for cosplayers looking to dress up as a Tarnished, it also comes with a wall mount for those who simply want to display their big weapon.

"Short answer: thanks to you folks," McGowan said. "I would be sitting in my office minding my own business when someone from the company would send me a link to a news article, or I would stumble across it myself. I teach Entertainment Law at the University of Washington and say this to my students: the worst thing on earth is when your 'fan' project gets press, because now I know about you."

And, this week, actor Walton Goggins has shared more on his character The Ghoul, along with a clip from the upcoming series.
Speaking with Seth Meyers, Goggins first of all stated his appreciation for his real nose, with his Fallout character quite clearly missing his. He said he had taken inspiration for the character from American country singer and actor Kris Kristofferson, but if he was 250 years old and lived in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
"We wanted him to be attractive, you know. We wanted audiences to lean into his look and not be repulsed by it," Goggins said, adding that it took the team five hours to transform him into Fallout's Ghoul. As for that clip I mentioned, we get to see The Ghoul in all his Fallout glory, as he searches out his bounty (and it's Benjamin Linus from Lost!). You can check it out below.

The email thread, spotted by GameDiscoverCo, was between Sweeney and Valve's head Gabe Newell discussing the economics of the Steam platform. It began in 2017 with an email from Newell to Sweeney pointedly asking "Anything we doing to annoy you?" and referencing a post from Valve's Sean Jenkins about restricting Steam keys given to developers. 


Sweeney responded instead on "the economics of these 30 percent platform fees" which he described as "no longer justifiable". In short, he said the marketing benefits of the Steam storefront is "far disproportionate to the fee" thanks to "the churn of new game releases".

Nightingale launched on 20th February with a Steam peak of 47,569 players, but this has trailed off ever since, and this week has seen active player counts in the single digit thousands. Meanwhile, player reviews are listed as "mixed". Studio boss Aaryn Flynn has said the team was now gathering feedback, and that the team was aware of several issues. 


"We've been spending a lot of our time reading your impressions online, going through Discord, watching your streams and building our plans for the next phase of the game," Flynn shared. "There are some things we are not happy with about the game," he continued, acknowledging Nightingale's network issues, missing quality of life improvements, and other aspects were "not quite where we want them to be".

<blockquote><p>The immediate problem &#8220;is&#8221; that it’s Too Easy By Default™ to write security and safety vulnerabilities in C++ that would have been caught by stricter enforcement of known rules for <i>type, bounds, initialization</i>, and <i>lifetime</i> language safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>His conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to improve software security and software safety across the industry, especially by improving programming language safety in C and C++, and in C++ a 98% improvement in the four most common problem areas is achievable in the medium term. But if we focus on programming language safety alone, we may find ourselves fighting yesterday’s war and missing larger past and future security dangers that affect software written in any language...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has unveiled The Machine Age, the next major expansion for its space-faring 4X strategy game Stellaris, which will focus on "cybernetic, synthetic, and machine themes" when it launches for PC in the second quarter of 2024.


"Scientists have discovered advanced means to commune with the machine, enabling life to overcome the biological limitations of minds and flesh," explains Paradox. "The Machine Age begins a time of technical glory, but raises new ethical and social dilemmas. With those times of unleashed ambition, new threats will emerge, questioning the real meaning of life itself."


And with that bit of scene-setting out the way, Paradox gets onto some of The Machine Age's new features, which include a new Endgame Crisis, based around the return of an ancient synthetic threat, alongside a new Crisis Path focused on technological ascendancy at any cost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fen Research, the studio founded by original RuneScape designer Andrew Gower, has unveiled Brighter Shores - a "cosy" new free-to-play fantasy MMORPG coming to PC and Mac later this year that promises a "relaxing respite from daily life".


Brighter Shores, which is said to have been ten years in the making, whisks players away to the peaceful coastal town of Hopeport, where they'll initially take on the role of town guard. Soon, however, they'll find themselves venturing beyond the town walls "as they learn of a greater threat across the fantastical world of Adothria."


There's talk of "quirky characters, fascinating foes and captivating locations" for players to encounter as they explore the world, having adopted one of three classes: Cryoknight, Hammermage, or Guardian. These options are supposed to mark a break from the traditional likes of mage, rogue, and warrior, with Fen Research promises other "new and exciting twists" on the MMORPG genre, including a deliberate shift away from 'grindy' gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saber Interactive chief operating officer Tim Willits has taken to social media to confirm a "number of titles" remain in development at the publisher - including Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - following today's Embracer Group sale.


This morning, following rumours of a sale last month, embattled publisher Embracer announced it had reached an agreement to sell large portions of Saber Interactive for $247m. The buyer is Beacon Interactive, a company established by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch.


As part of that news, Embracer confirmed it had retained two joint projects with Saber, with one of those being the troubled Star Wars: The Old Republic Remake, according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier. It was unclear, however, if today's sale would impact any of the other previously announced titles in development at Saber.

The re-release of these beloved classics hasn't gone well, however, with players reporting numerous bugs on all platforms, as well as seeking refunds. Another major issue players have encountered is the limited servers for each platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami has detailed a new update for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1, which adds a pause menu to Sons of Liberty.
This patch - or Version 1.5.0, to give it its full name - is available now for those on Steam. It will arrive on PlayStation, Switch and Xbox consoles on an unspecified date "late" this month.
Along with adding a pause menu, this update will also address issues where certain cutscenes just stopped playing on their own accord, and sorted out analog inputs that weren't working as intended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon fans have found a small tease for upcoming Legends game Z-A in Scarlet and Violet.
As picked up by reddit user KyleLaverre, there are signs in Scarlet and Violet that use the same cryptic lettering seen written in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A announcement trailer. Meanwhile, a character in this area will explain that the five buildings by this sign are all "owned by a real estate firm called Paldea Realty".
Fans believe the Paldea Realty group could therefore be the same company undertaking the urban redevelopment plan for Lumiose City, as teased in Z-A's announcement trailer (which you can see below).

In an AMA session on reddit, developer and artist localthunk was asked for comment on how PEGI mishandled the game's rating after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'", as per publisher Playstack's statement at the time.



"I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is," said localthunk. "I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren't rated the same way because of their appearance/theme."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Troubled video game publisher Embracer has announced the sale of more of its assets - this time, large portions of Saber Interactive, for the price of $247m.


In a financial call this morning, Embracer said the sale means it will cease all operations in Russia, something that will help it "reduce [its] geopolitical risk" - though the buyer, a company named Beacon Interactive, is founded by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch. 

Karch will now lead Saber's studios separately from Embracer, though in a statement said he would remain "a large, long-term shareholder of Embracer" who will continue to partner with the company on "several ongoing and future projects". In the financial call, Embracer boss Lars Wingefors noted Karch would not retain any management or board position at Embracer, however.

Anomaly - RimWorld's fourth paid expansion after Biotech, Royalty, and Ideology - begins as colonists accidentally provoke a mad superintelligence, unleashing its horrors and twisting the world with "ominous, puzzling, mind-controlling, and earth-shaking" threats.


The idea, explains Ludeon over on Steam, is to give players the tools they need to build their own horror stories, with the developer citing the likes of Cabin in the Woods, The Thing, The Cthulhu mythos, and Hellraiser as inspirations for the expansion.

Next week's free update, officially titled Warrior's Path, includes the aforementioned permadeath mode alongside a speedrun mode and four new outfits for Lost Crown protagonist Sargon. It'll be followed by another free update in "spring", titled Boss Attack, which introduces a boss rush mode and more Sargon outfits.


The additions look to get a bit meatier in The Lost Crown's free summer update, known as Divine Trials, with Ubisoft promising new combat, puzzle, and platform challenges, alongside a selection of new amulets, additional outfits for Sargon, "and more".

V Rising, if you're unfamiliar, launched into early access back in May 2022, delivering an isometric survival adventure in which players and their friends explore a gloomy open-world attempting to establish their vampiric superiority.


It's got some neat twists on the survival formula, including a day/night cycle that forces players to stick to the shadows while the sun is high (for obvious reasons), a blood -sucking mechanic granting specific abilities depending on the creatures drained, and - perhaps best of all - the ability to build your own imposing castle. All of which helped V Rising become an almost immediate hit, amassing over 1m players in just over a week following its early access launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed the games joining its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogues in March, with Capcom's Resident Evil remake and the Firaxis' stellar superhero strategy game Marvel's Midnight Suns leading the charge.


Marvel's Midnight Suns, available for both PlayStation 4 and PS5, pits players against the forces of Lilith, Mother of Demons, with a little bit of help from an extensive superhero roster. It combines turn-based strategy action with surprisingly enjoyable relationship-building interludes, somewhat similar to Fire Emblem, and is very good indeed.


Also good is Capcom's Resident Evil 3 remake (also for PS4 and PS5), which spruces up the 1999 survival horror - albeit not to quite the same impressive degree as the Resident Evil 2 remake - to deliver a rollicking trip through Raccoon City as the monstrous Nemesis persues Jill Valentine and co. It's joined by Lego DC Supervillains for PS4 - an open-world action romp that features the likes of The Joker, Harley Quinn, and other members of the Injustice League - with the full PlayStation Plus Extra line-up as follows:

Keen Games revealed its roadmap - heavily inspired by the community's most-requested features - over on Steam, explaining, "On the one hand, we have big ambitions for the game, and loads of ideas! On the other hand, Enshrouded is a brand new game, and some of the things we want to do might turn out to be more difficult than we can anticipate! It's a push-and-pull of wanting to keep you interested, without over-promising on our capacity to deliver."

As previously promised, there's no change for game developers, who pay a flat five percent royalty to use Unreal Engine if their project ends up earning over $1m.

Now, though, developers are "satisfied with movie soundtrack-like music in games", he said. "I think people need to have more freedom when creating [game music]," he continued, adding that unless composers move away from movie-style scores, the genre of "game music cannot develop further".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a new update for Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered, which includes updated textures which will make keys more visible in TR1 (hurrah!) and improved lighting in those dimmer areas of the games overall (another hurrah!).
In addition, the developer has also added some missing HD textures across the board (perhaps those ones players on the Epic Games Store noticed), and sorted the textures that would periodically disappear depending on how the player had their camera positioned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has confirmed that its promising-looking Diablo-y Soulslike game No Rest for the Wicked will feature offline play for its solo mode. 


Moon Studios co-founder Gennadiy Korol confirmed the mode via a post on social media platform X, noting that it had been a "common question" - presumably after the lack of ability to play solo offline in other games recently.


No Rest for the Wicked "will not require online connection to play in Single Player and will feature a rich Offline Mode," Korol wrote. "Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Footage of a purportedly cancelled co-operative live-service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - has appeared online following last year's ransomware attack targeting the developer and its employees.


The trailer (narrated by Yuri Lowenthal, the voice of Insomniac's Peter Parker) points to a five-player co-op Spider-Man game featuring various multiverse incarnations of the character - including Gwen Stacey, Spider-Man 2099, and Scarlet Spider, alongside Peter Parker and Miles Morales - who would go up against the Sinister Six in an open-world Manhattan.


Spider-Man: The Great Web first came to light following last year's ransomware attack on Insomniac, and would seemingly have been part of Sony's ambitious but floundering live-service plans - announced under the watch of departing PlayStation boss Jim Ryan in 2021 - with Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer project being the most high-profile casualty.

The move marks an extension of Discord's Activities initiative that launched last December, offering a limited number of embedded games and interactive experiences users could engage with together on the platform.


Initially, 19 Activities were available to users, but Discord is now looking to significantly expand that by giving third-party developers the tools - in the form of its newly announced Embedded App SDK - to create their own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tobias Sjögren has been removed from his role as CEO of developer Starbreeze after the company's board concluded the studio "needs a different leadership" to execute its current business strategy. The announcement follows a disastrous launch for last year's Payday 3, which is still struggling to attract players in significant numbers.


Starbreeze's board announced Sjögren's removal in a note to investors, adding that board member - and former CEO of Focus Home interactive - Juergen Goeldner would be serving as interim CEO as the recruitment process for a permanent replacement gets underway.


"The company has a clear strategy centred around creating attractive games on our own and licensed IPs," Starbreeze chairman Torgny Hellström said of today's management changes. "The board's consolidated assessment is that the execution of strategy needs a different leadership. Juergen Goeldner has been part of the board since 2023 and, with over 40 years of industry experience, is a strong interim solution".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Nightdive Studios' acclaimed remake of cult-classic sci-fi horror System Shock is - following a successful release on PC last year - making its way to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on 21st May.


Despite a bit of a bumpy road to release, the System Shock remake impressed on its arrival in 2023, giving Looking Glass Technologies' 1994 immersive sim - which sees players grappling with a malevolent AI onboard the Citadel Station deep in space - a finely judged overhaul.


"Nightdive doesn't take the Capcom or Square Enix approach with this remake; they're actually pretty uncompromising in their mission to update the original," Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin wrote in his four star review last year. "But ultimately, the System Shock remake faithfully recreates a classic, retains most of its appeal, reframes everything with a horror tilt, and as a result, makes it more playable for everyone."

You can give the game a go right now via its Steam demo, which was one of the highlights of the most recent Steam Next Fest. The game has grungey neon visuals and boasts some brainteasing levels - but its the just-one-more-go gameplay that really makes the experience stand out. 


With just one bullet in your rifle's chamber, you need to re-aim and curve shots in mid-flight to zig-zag around levels, through cultists and wildlife, without losing focus. Discovering the best ways to do that takes a bit of time - but can then be speedrun for the best times.

The collection is already available on Nintendo Switch and PC, as it was released for the platforms in 2019. The console release will bundle the two games together like the Switch version does, rather than releasing the two games separately as on Steam.
Like the Switch version of Grandia HD Collection, the PS4 and Xbox One releases will have physical editions, sold by Limited Run Games, as well as being available digitally. The games are also compatible with PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, publisher Gungho Online Entertainment notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Production artwork for the Super Mario Bros. Movie shows a number Mushroom Kingdom characters who didn't make it into the final film - including Princess Daisy, Toadette, Eurogamer favourite Birdo, and the loyal Toadsworth.


The artwork, created by freelance veteran Jed Diffenderfer, was recently spotted after being uploaded to his website (thanks, Nintendo Life). 


Diffenderfer states he worked as a story artist on the Super Mario Bros. Movie project from 2018 to 2020 - so it's likely that some of the artwork he created dates from early on in the project, before certain narrative choices were made.

At last week's Xbox Partner Preview, Atlus announced an expansion pass for the remake, including the much-requested epilogue The Answer. 



Persona 3 Reload, released earlier this year, was criticised for not including all the extras from various past versions of the game to provide a complete experience. Now, in a new interview with Famitsu (via Persona Central), series general producer Kazuhisa Wada has shared how that feedback inspired development of the expansion.

Today's enhancements, which arrive as part of what Turn 10 is referring to as Update 6, makes a number of adjustments, starting with the ability for players to equip the car parts they want to install regardless of Car Level.

Developer Bungie revealed the incoming "Destiny 2 x Ghostbusters" collaboration on social media, with a post proclaiming, "There's something strange in our neighbourhood...".


An accompanying image highlighted three Ghostbusters collaboration cosmetics, including a Ghost skin resembling iconic series nuisance Slimer (a literal ghost), alongside a slightly demonic - but not especially Ghostbusters-y) Sparrow sin, and an Echo-1 that'll presumably be skin for Destiny 2's recently introduced hoverboards.

Speaking with GameInformer, Yoshida stated the upcoming port is progressing well. However, he refrained from giving any further specifics, such as when it may be ready for release. 


"When we can release the PC version might be dependent on that - the system requirements and specifications for PC that players will need, so we're trying to figure that out," Yoshida explained, adding that "naturally, [the PC specifications] are looking to be somewhat high".

Last week, Capcom released the character creator for Dragon's Dogma 2 at an opportune moment (just in time for the weekend), giving people plenty of days to create their Arisen and pawn before the game releases.

Now it's time to see the fruits of everybody's labour, and oh my. Some have chosen to recreate characters from other games to a high degree of accuracy, whilst others have opted to get a little bit silly with it. Players have made some impressive characters on both sides of the spectrum, and here are some which really stand out.

"The team has heard your feedback, we've learned a lot from our open beta," Huynh said in a video announcing the upcoming release (see below). "From day one, we set out to make a game that not only packs a punch, but makes a mark on the game genre we love."

In an interview with Den of Geek, Bethesda's Todd Howard - who is serving as an executive producer on the Amazon series - said on occasion he had to tell the show's team: "Don't do this because we are going to do that in Fallout 5."
While it's a shame we don't know exactly what those ideas were, it's proof of how authentic this adaptation is shaping up to be.

Speaking during a Q&A session at SXSW in Austin, Texas, over the weekend, SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said the probability a strike will go ahead in the next four to six weeks is "50-50, or more likely than that" (via Variety).
SAG-AFTRA voted overwhelmingly in favour of a video game strike in September 2023. While no strike action was taken by the union, it was unable to negotiate an update to the Interactive Media Agreement which covers union members' work in games. At the time, AI was one of the key issues being discussed and it  has remained just as important.

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the former CEO recently approached ByteDance co-founder Zhang Yiming to state his intent, should the company agree to sell the video sharing app.
The publication stated Kotick is currently looking for partners to join in this potential acquisition, which WSJ said any price tag is "estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars". According to sources familiar with the situation, Kotick suggested the idea of buying TikTok at an Allen & Co dinner earlier this week, to a group of potential partners. This group reportedly included Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI.

In a candid interview with VentureBeat, Layden detailed how he thinks the industry has changed since he joined Sony in the 1980s, working his way up to become president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America in 2014. Now an adviser to companies like Tencent and Web3 ventures, Layden was quick to detail the problems he sees in platform exclusivity, especially as development costs continue to rocket.
"When your costs for a game exceed $200 million, exclusivity is your Achilles' heel," Layden said. "It reduces your addressable market. Particularly when you're in the world of live-service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in.

"When I first saw how much content would need to be created for this game, even just for the combat, I honestly wasn’t sure that we could put it all together in time - from the huge amount of character abilities to the summons and the systems that allow you to fight alongside them, to the rich variety of enemy types that keeps the game feeling fresh whenever players enter a new location, to the boss battles that we crafted to have their own distinctive feel, and each and every one of these elements featuring its own rich variety of gameplay and visual elements," explained battle director, Teruki Endo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Mario Day celebrations continue, Nintendo has teased that new Lego Super Mario Kart sets will drop in 2025.
The accompanying video teaser is just 18 seconds long and gives very, very little away, unfortunately, but we do get to see a selection of silhouetted kart(s) and a delightfully happy-looking Lego-ised Mario.
Captioned "Ready, set, build", the only other information we get is confirmation that the sets will be ready to race in 2025. Sadly, there's no specific release date or even window just yet, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former EA and Microsoft exec, Peter Moore, says there are "serious questions" to be asked about video game hardware and whether or not there's a future for the traditional home console system.
Moore – who held senior positions at EA, Microsoft, and Sega before leaving gaming altogether to join Liverpool FC in 2017 – reflected on the losses incurred whenever there's a new console generation, suggesting that both "companies and gamers" are asking questions about whether or not players "really need to be spending what could be five, $600 on a bespoke piece of hardware just to play games".
"I think it's a real serious question that's being asked I'm sure in Tokyo, in Redmond, Washington, in Kyoto," Moore told the delightful Wes Yin-Poole at IGN. "That's what everybody's working on right now, because when you start off that next generation, you've got to be ready to absorb billions of dollars in losses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake has been rated in Korea.
The highly-anticipated horror game – one of gaming's worst-kept secrets before it was formally revealed back in October 2022 – has been given a mature rating due to, as translated by Google, "excessive violence, excessive blood from hitting and being hit (and there is physical damage such as creatures being separated)", and excessive depictions that some may find fearful and/or disgusting, including "creatures with strangely formed limbs" – a Silent Hill staple, of course.
While the decision was awarded at the end of last month – 29th February, to be precise – there's no intimation on a release date, and both developer Bloober Team and publisher Konami remain taciturn, only willing to commit to a release by the end of the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the launch of Sea of Thieves' radical structural overhaul last month, Rare is readying to release a new mid-season update next week that'll add anti-cheat and subscription-free solo play to its swashbuckling pirate adventure. Plus, a big 2024 content preview is on the way as part of Sea of Thieves' sixth anniversary celebrations.


Starting with anti-cheat, Rare has confirmed it'll be introducing Epic's kernel-level Easy Anti-Cheat solution - as used by the likes of Fortnite and Apex Legends - to Sea of Thieves next Thursday, 14th March. There's not much more to report beyond its imminent arrival, but the news'll probably bring some reassurance if you think you've been privy to suspicious behaviour out on the seas. And I'm not talking spyglass dongs.


Additionally, next week's update brings an interesting expansion to last year's Safer Seas mode. From next Thursday onward, it'll be possible for pirates to play alone on a Safer Seas private server without needing a Game Pass Core or Game Pass Ultimate subscription. The key points to note here are that this isn't an offline mode - Sea of Thieves is still intrinsically reliant on its servers - and any form of multiplayer, even in Safer Seas, will still require Game Pass.

That's according to Deadline, which reports the Watch Dogs movie will be helmed by director Mathieu Turi (who's currently adapting A Plague Tale for television), working from a screenplay by Christie LeBlanc - the writer behind Netflix's 2021 French sci-fi thriller Oxygen.


The Watch Dogs movie is in development at New Regency Productions but, beyond word of Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde's potential involvement and the rather obvious note from Deadline that it'll be "set within the universe of Ubisoft's" series, details are limited.

It provides our best look yet at the show, with three minutes of footage for us to pore over. And dare I say, it actually looks… decent? To my surprise, I quite liked it?
I've rewatched the trailer several times now to see if there's any new information we can glean hidden in the details, and there are a few things worth pointing out (as well as some references to my all-time favourite in the series, Fallout: New Vegas).

Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths and Mortals was set to go live this morning, UK time, but will now launch at 10pm tonight at the earliest. 


This is due to a last-minute issue discovered during the game's still-ongoing downtime today, which will take at least the rest of the UK day to resolve.

"The development team will be credited in the game credits," a Nintendo spokesperson simply told me today when I enquired which developer had made the game.


There's no reason why Nintendo has to say who has made the game, of course, but fans have said it feels odd that the answer remains a mystery, just a few weeks away from Princess Peach: Showtime!'s 22nd March debut, after press have already played a preview build of the game, and following the launch of this week's public demo.

LLMs through a Global Scale Prompt Hacking Competition</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed in interactive contexts with direct user engagement, such as chatbots and writing assistants. These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for free-form human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking. We also present a comprehensive taxonomical ontology of the types of adversarial prompts...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

In a social media post soon after the update went live, Insomniac said a hotfix was on the way, as using this menu could corrupt saves and players' trophy progress. "There is no risk associated with playing the game as intended," Insomnia said.
However, despite the studio's efforts, this menu was of course accessed, and players have discovered content that was not in the base game, suggesting it was either cut ahead of release, or may be used later for DLC. Please note, potential spoilers lie below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic has revealed the next titles it's giving away on the Epic Games Store, with Deux Ex: Mankind Divided and The Bridge getting the freebie treatment from Thursday, 14th March.


Deux Ex: Mankind Divided is the fifth instalment in Square Enix's stealthy, shooty sci-fi series and a direct sequel to 2012's Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Once again cyber-augmented protagonist Adam Jensen returns, and the ensuing adventure was deemed to be a "smart, handsome and weighty addition to the stealth-action genre" in Eurogamer's review.


As for The Bridge, it's a gravity shifting puzzle game created by Ty Taylor - and described as "Isaac Newton meets M. C. Escher" - that challenges players to manoeuvre the world and reach the exit each stage. Eurogamer quite liked this one on release in 2013, even if it sometimes felt like "the taster course for a more satisfying meal kept frustratingly off the menu."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funcom, developer of the upcoming Dune: Awakening, has issued a statement regarding the role of religion in the game after fan concerns erupted on the internet this week.


In Eurogamer's preview of Dune: Awakening, Funcom chief creative officer Joel Bylos mentioned how "for the large part, we sort of sidestep religion" as part of the game's "alternate history approach" - something which, as we wrote at the time, was likely to initially set Dune nerds' alarm bells ringing. 


But the decision to "sidestep" Dune's overtly religious aspects in Awakening has been taken out of consideration for the series' lore, our Chris Tapsell wrote, and refers to one "religious aspect" in particular. That said, religion is still a theme in the game - something seemingly evident by its focus on the Butlerian jihad: the war between humans and AI.

"THIS IS NOT A DRILL," the Helldivers 2 social media team proclaimed earlier today, stating a recent (fictional) attack has halted all mech output. "Helldivers have been deployed to liberate Tien Kwan!"


Based on this post, it seems like we will soon be sent to Tien Kwan to deal with whatever pest is currently tormenting those poor, sweet, mech factories, and to liberate their metal machines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four years after a live-action Fallout TV adaptation was officially announced, the show is almost upon us. And ahead of its Amazon Video debut on 12th April - and following years of official images, unofficial behind-the-scenes shots, and even a sizeable teaser - we've got our best look yet at the adaptation, courtesy of a new three-minute series trailer.


Going by the trailer below, the adaptation makes a positive first impression, convicingly capturing the Fallout games' ever-shifting tone - blending gee-whizz '50s Americana with grubby post-apocalyptic mayhem as Ella Purnell's Vault Dweller protagonist Jean leaves her lifelong underground home to venture out into the Los Angeles Wasteland.


Speaking during a press panel ahead of today's trailer reveal, co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet explained that while the adaptation is set in the world of Fallout, it's also a "new story that comes after the events we've seen" in the games. "The show is built on 25 years of creativity and thinking and building," co-showrunner Graham Wagner added, "and we sort of thought the best thing to do is to continue that versus retread it. Because that's sort of what has worked with Fallout over the years. It's traded hands... it's a living thing... and we felt like we ought to take a swing at trying to build a new piece on top of all of that."

To recap, Sweet Baby Inc. recently became the target of a group which claimed the company was forcing studios it worked with to increase diversity within its games, and accused it of pushing a "woke agenda" into the industry. Following a report into the claims by Kotaku, a number of game developers have spoken up to clear up misconceptions about what companies like Sweet Baby Inc. actually do. 
Kenney, who has written for games including Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Telltale's The Walking Dead and the upcoming Marvel's Wolverine, posted a thread on X yesterday. "Some of you don't seem to understand how narrative consulting on games works," she began, "but don't worry: I do!"

On Sleight of Hand's release next year across Xbox Series X/S and PC (including day one on Game Pass), players will take on the role of Lady Luck, a former occult detective "fated to return for one final job". And that job? Taking down her former Coven after a "less than amicable departure" which saw her lose her left hand. 


"Too tired to fight fate any longer, and with more overdue bills than bucks to her name, Lady Luck strikes out to Steeple City with a cursed deck in hand, ready to track down everyone from her past life," reads Sleight of Hands description.

In a blog post shared yesterday, Mojang detailed each new wolfy variant. The wolves all live in their own, specific areas, with the Rusty wolf "hiding between the jungle vines". The Spotted wolf, meanwhile, can be found in the Savanna Plateau. 


Other wolves currently being put through the test are: The Black wolf, the Striped wolf, the Snowy wolf, the Ashen wolf, the Woods wolf and the Chestnut wolf. Meanwhile, Minecraft's original wolf is now going to be known as the Pale wolf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The EU is stepping in to investigate the latest development in the feud between Apple and Epic, with European regulators now seeking answers from Apple on yesterday's news - that it had banned Epic's developer account. 
To recap, Epic announced it would be launching an iOS version of its store in Europe back in February, following Apple's confirmation it would be complying with the EU's Digital Markets Act requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices. Epic subsequently received an official Apple Developer Account, and said it planned to launch its app store sometime this year.
Yesterday, however, it was revealed that Apple had now terminated Epic's developer account on the basis the company had been "verifiably untrustworthy" in the past, a move which Epic said was a "serious violation of the [Digital Markets Act]" within the EU. Now, a European Commission spokesperson confirmed to Reuters it had "requested further explanations" on the ban under the DMA.

Sharing details of its most recent fix, Larian stated it had found a crash bug that was only affecting Xbox. "We're taking the time to investigate and solve that issue, so your future adventures go a little smoother," Larian said.
A knock on effect of this delay means cross-saves are currently not loadable on Xbox consoles, if they come from other platforms which have been updated with to include hotfixes 20 or 21. The developer apologised for this, and said it is working to sort these Xbox fixes "as soon as possible".

Seccomp stands for secure computing mode and has been a feature of the Linux
kernel since version 2.6.12. It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a
process, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the
kernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a
node to your Pods and containers.
But distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,
because the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can
possibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles
Operator solve that problem by
running as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that
distribution could be done by the container
runtime.
Runtimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer LocalThunk's Balatro might have hit a bit of a bump last week after an unexpected ratings change, but that hasn't stopped the acclaimed poker-inspired rogue-like deckbuilder from selling over half a million copies in ten days, according to publisher Playstack.


That's an impressive figure for what's a fairly unassuming card game at first glance. Balatro, if you're unfamiliar, challenges players to progress through a series of stage-like Blinds by exceeding each one's target score. A maximum of four poker hands can played each blind, and failure to reach the target, in classic rogue-like fashion, results in a game over.


As you can probably guess, though, there's a lot more to it than that, with successful Blinds rewarding in-game money to spend on the likes of fancy combo-boosting cards, exotic upgrades, and, crucially, a heap of rule-bending Jokers that quickly turn a relatively unremarkable set-up into an outlandish game of ludicrous, score-busting synergies.

Park now says, "The entire FF7 trilogy is NOT yet confirmed to be Sony exclusive. The article has been amended to only mention Remake and Rebirth."


Of course, with Remake and Rebirth still being described as PlayStation console exclusives in the Washington Post report (an assertion you'd assume has now been very thoroughly run by Sony and Square), it would be unusual if the third entry in the series proved to be an outlier - but for now, consider the exclusivity status of part three still unconfirmed.

The game is co-developed by Spanish indie studios Inverse and Chibig, with Tomb Raider writer Rhianna Pratchett involved in creating the narrative.

Players will take on the role of Vic, an adventurer who is on an expedition in a land called Ava. An infection is affecting Ava's local species of wildlife, causing them to be aggressive rather than their usual friendly selves, and players will help to heal the creatures and learn about the infection's origins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xbox Partner Preview showcase offered us a look at a number of the third-party games heading to Xbox Series X/S this year. We were shown a variety of trailers during the 30-minute presentation, including a taste of the Japanese mythology inspried Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and the announcement of The Sinking City 2. 
Whether you missed the presentation or want to revisit one of the spotlighted titles, there's a roundup of everything shown during the Xbox Partner Preview showcase below. 
The showcase began with a look at Unknown 9: Awakening from Reflector and Bandai Namco. This body-hopping adventure will be arriving in the summer of 2024. Unknown 9: Awakening has a very strong Assassin's Creed vibe, so, if you're an Assassin's fan, this might be one for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic's plans to launch a version of its Epic Games Store on iOS in the EU have stalled after Apple terminated its developer account, calling the company "verifiably untrustworthy" - and the much-trumpeted return of Fortnite to iOS has been impacted too. 


Epic announced it would be launching an iOS version of its store in Europe back in February, following Apple's confirmation it would be complying with the EU's Digital Markets Act requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices. While Epic boss Tim Sweeney immediately launched a social media tirade in response to the announcement - calling Apple's planned implementation of the EU's rules "hot garbage" - Epic soon confirmed it had officially received an Apple Developer Account and would be launching a version of its Epic Games Store, operated by Epic Games Sweden, sometime this year.


Now, however, Epic claims Apple has terminated its Epic Games Sweden AB developer account, preventing it from developing an iOS store - a move it says is  "a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices."

McMahon had previously been expected to appear in the game's roster, but publisher 2K confirmed both McMahon and Brock Lesnar had been cut after allegations of sexual assault and trafficking against the former were made earlier this year.
Despite this, McMahon appears in some parts of the game's showcase mode, which allows players to play through iconic moments in WrestleMania history. The showcase includes real footage and in-game recreations of the events, with McMahon censored in some places.

Ghost of Tsushima launched for PlayStation 4 and PS5 back in July 2020, and a Director's Cut - bundling together the acclaimed base game, its Iki Island expansion, and cooperative online multiplayer Legends mode - arrived the following year. It's this version that'll be hitting PC in May, with Sony having now detailed some of the game's PC-specific enhancements.


As revealed in a post on the PlayStation Blog, Ghost of Tsushima for PC will offer unlocked frame rates, various graphics settings and presets, customisable mouse and keyboard controls, plus "extensive" controller support. It is, for instance, possible to use Steam Input to remap and customise the controller of your choice, and those using a DualSense controller can take advantage of its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon's Fallout TV adaptation is set to debut next month, and to get us all in the mood, Xbox has added a new Fallout-inspired controller to Design Lab.
The design in question features a Fallout top case and side caps, with outlined Vault Boys adorning the cover. One chap is in colour, wearing his iconic blue and yellow ensemble while playing on an Xbox controller of his own. I won't lie, I really like this design and now want one for myself.
As you would expect from Design Lab, those who fancy grabbing themselves a Fallout-inspired Xbox controller will also be able to customise it with a variety of button styles, triggers and D-pad options (although Xbox has laid out some ideas inspired by Vault Dwellers, the Brotherhood, the Pip-Boy and, of course, mutants).

Ahead of the DLC's announcement, Miyazaki told IGN there was still a secret yet to be discovered, which of course sent fans off to find this nugget.


"For me personally, there is a small element that I feel has not yet been discovered. So, whether that's up to user interpretation or up to just further investigation and playing, that's something I'm looking forward to," said Miyazaki. "I think it's a question of when and not if, but there may be something small still missing."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking to bring a bit of summer sun into the lingering bleakness of a waning winter, then boy do I have a recommendation for you - assuming you're up for some pitch-black, emotionally pulverising horror. Mediterranea Inferno, last year's dazzling visual novel from The Milky Way Prince creator Lorenzo Redaelli, is out now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.


Mediterranea Inferno follows a trio of beautiful, fashionable Milan club kids in their early 20s as they reunite, after two years apart due to lingering COVID restrictions, for a three-day vacation in the blazing heat of a southern Italian summer. What follows is an artfully orchestrated descent into nightmare - a vicious, emotionally pummelling, and unabashedly queer tale of friendship and post-COVID trauma where players, in Redaelli's own words, can push "three bourgeois twinks...towards the most horrible and gruesome endings".


It's an absolute sledgehammer of a game - "a dense, provocative, playful, exasperating, horrifying, poetic, often very funny, and occasionally even profound rumination on the sometimes paralysing search for a place in the disenfranchising shadow of modern-day life", as I wrote in my five star review - and easily the most relentlessly stylish game of 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight months after Warner Bros.' platform-brawler MultiVersus went dark, following an announcement its open beta would be shutting down until a return sometime in 2024, its social media account has sprung back to live, teasing an update announcement soon.


MultiVersus launched into Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC open beta back in July 2022, and got off to a flying start - ratcheting up over 10m players in the space of a month. However, its player numbers rapidly dwindled and by the time developer Play First Games pulled the game offline last June, its Steam concurrent player count had fallen from a high of 153,000 to just 448.


As to when MultiVersus would be likely to return, that remained vague, with Play First Games only saying it expected servers to come back online sometime in "early 2024". And it's proven to be a particularly controversial period of downtime, not only for its length but because Warner Bros. refused to refund players for any packs, passes, premium currency bundles, or cosmetics they'd purchased across MutliVersus' nearly year-long, multi-season open beta, insisting all purchased items would be usable again once the game returned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades, the acclaimed rogue-like dungeon-crawler from developer Supergiant - and by 'acclaimed', we're talking Game-of-the-Year levels of good here - launches for iOS as part of a Netflix subscription later this month, on 19th March.


Hades, the fourth game from Supergiant - following the studio's impressive Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre - charts protagonist Zagreus' attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, all with a little bit of help from an entire pantheon of Greek gods.


It's an isometric action-adventure built around a wonderfully punchy combat system that follows the classic rogue-like template by offering handy permanent upgrades after an escape attempt fails, all in aid of helping Zagreus inch just a little bit closer to freedom each time.

Speaking during a recent Morgan Stanley event (thanks Gamespot), Perrette said the company would combat volatility by focusing on its biggest franchises and bringing some to the mobile and free-to-play space in addition to live-service games. The aim is more consistent revenue.


"We're doubling down on games as an area where we think there is a lot more growth opportunity that we can tap into with the IP that we have and some of the capabilities we have on the studio where we're uniquely positioned as both a publisher and a developer of games," he said.

The video, posted to LinkedIn by a former Free Radical Design staff member, shows a version of the game from July 2023 - roughly five months before the project was cancelled and the studio shut down by parent company Embracer.


TimeSplitters fans will likely be excited (and upset, seeing as the project is now dead) to see numerous familiar elements return, including an expanded Siberia dam level, iconic weapons, fan-favourite characters and GoldenEye's classic health/shield UI.

Meta has been sending emails to Meta Quest owners to remind them of the deadline (via The Verge), following a gradual shift from Oculus accounts, which are linked to Facebook accounts, to email-based Meta accounts.

However, he has now confirmed that that extra fourth disc is indeed needed. As previously announced, the PlayStation 5 version will ship on two discs, while the PC version just has the one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's first season of post-launch content gets underway on 28th March, introducing The Joker as a new playable character. Additionally, the delayed Epic Games Store version of Suicide Squad is now scheduled to launch on 26th March.


When developer Rocksteady detailed its post-launch plans for Suicide Squad in January, it confirmed each of the four seasons it's currently committed to will bring a new playable DC character (each yanked from an alternate-reality Elseworlds), plus a new playable environment, new activities, new weapons and gear sets, mid-season updates, and "more".


Season 1's Elseworlds Joker has already raised a few eyebrows, thanks to his dainty mace and not-exactly-on-brand rocket-powered umbrella that'll let him launch into the air, drift, and grind on buildings to knock enemies out of the way. If that appeals though, he arrives alongside his new environment, two new episodes - featuring missions, activities, and strongholds - new boss fights and enemy variants, new Riddler content, and new DC Villain-themed weapons and gear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behold the ultimate form of the Xbox Series X; Microsoft has unveiled an official SpongeBob SquarePants special editon of the console that makes the best, most glorious use of its oblong shape yet. Unfortunately, it's US-only at present, so boo.


Microsoft's new 'Xbox Series X – Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 Special Edition Bundle' has, as its name very strongly suggests, been created to promote last year's Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, a Smash Bros.-style fighter that pits (yes) a bunch of Nickelodeon characters against each other in a family friendly fight to the family friendly death. That includes Invader Zim and Rocko from Rocko's Modern Life, so you'll hear no bad words from me. Needs more Pete & Pete though.


Anyway, the highlight of Microsoft's new Xbox Series X is undoubtedly the console itself, which transforms the machine's usual oblong heft in the absolute most perfect way, turning it into a beaming yellow SpongeBob that would look at home in any living room - assuming the living room owners have very specific tastes. Additionally, it comes with a genuinely awesome controller featuring Squidward, Gary, and Mr. Krabs, plus a copy of All-Star Brawl 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator Yuzu, has agreed to pay $2.4m in damages to Nintendo and cease all operations in response to the Mario maker's recent lawsuit.


News of Nintendo's legal action against Yuzu surfaced last week, with the company claiming the emulator facilitated piracy "at a colossal scale". By way of example, it said over 1m copies of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had been illegally downloaded ahead of its official launch - and that "many" pirate websites specified the game file was playable on Yuzu.


"Defendant [Tropic Haze] is thus secondarily liable for the infringement committed by the users to whom it distributes Yuzu", Nintendo's lawyers argued, with the lawsuit ultimately seeking damages and demanding the emulator be shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend, Fortnite simultaneously did something it had never done before, and something it hadn't done in ages. On the game's storied battle royale Island, players looked on as a giant hand made out of rapidly-cooling lava burst out of the ground, clasping an enormous treasure box that then lay, danging, high up in the air. 


The hand's appearance had been much anticipated. Rhythmic rumblings had been tracked by fans to a spot outside Ruined Reels - a sort-of Greek amphitheature turned open-air cinema - and a slowly widening crack in the ground nearby. A new character, the aptly-named Odyssey, had already appeared nearby to dole out some much-needed exposition and teasing for Fortnite's incoming Ancient Greek-themed new season. And outside the game, dataminers quickly discovered what was about to happen and posted it all on social media. The stage was set. 


So when the hand emerged, people knew what to do. That big box? It could be opened, if the chains around it were broken. And so players got to work. Some ignored Fortnite's normal battle royale rules completely, sticking instead to simply landing on the Island and shooting/pickaxing the chest's restraints, breaking them over the course of several hours, one-by-one. Others, predictably, decided to capitalise on all this by setting up camp nearby and sniping those trying to open the box. Debate raged about player etiquette - something which took me back to the outrage at people who wiped out upwards of 50-players at once as they settled in to watch Fortnite's first ever in-game event, the rocket launch, back in 2018.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Crema has announced it'll be removing all monetisation from its Pokemon-like creature-battler Temtem in an update scheduled for June, with one final major patch to follow before updates refocus on bug fixing and balance changes.


Crema shared the news in a lengthy post on Steam, which spent a lot of time addressing ongoing player complaints around a lack of major new content since launch, such as more islands, new Temtem, or additional multiplayer features. Broadly, the studio says Temtem's early access demonstrated major new content didn't have a significant impact on the game's player base, making it difficult to justify the development resources required - although other issues, such as mounting technical debt, are also cited as concerns.


After a lot of words, including some regret over having described the game as an "MMO" in its marketing material, Crema gets to the crux of its post: that it will release two more major updates for Temtem before development switches to more modest bug fixing and balance patches, as the studio's focus turns to new projects.

And, presumably much more importantly for Conan fans, there'll be no penis sliders either.
There will be sand-walking, though, and there's no ruling out of sandworm-riding down the line. We spoke with Dune: Awakening's creative director Joel Bylos at some length in our preview, and he explained the decision like this:
"We actually looked into it. It's just a very strong technical cost, and also a very - it needs a purpose. And we haven't got what the movie has, which is like, 'Go through the southern sandstorms, get to the southern part [of Arrakis]'. So yeah, we don't have that yet."

Yes, I'm still thinking about the infamous Willy Wonka Experience held in a sadly-decorated warehouse in Glasgow. I didn't visit it in real life for myself, but all of us have already been able to experience it vicariously through memes, quotes from frustrated parents, and interviews with the poor actors who had no idea what they were getting themselves into when they signed their contracts.
And now it's in Fortnite. After trying it myself, I imagine the actual thing was pretty similar to Jonesy's Chocolate Factory Experience, a Fortnite Creative map made by player ImSachiko. With a complimentary jelly bean being handed out and children crying in the corner, it does not disappoint.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marty O'Donnell, the former Bungie composer best known for his Halo and Destiny soundtracks, has announced his intention to run for US Congress as a Republican candidate. 


In a lengthy post on social media platform X, O'Donnell said he "never wanted to be a politician and I still don't" but felt he needed to "step up" after seeing "the leaders of our country being influenced by the toxic divisions that are tearing apart our families and society".


O'Donnell's campaign website is now live, with a notable Halo-esque vibe. Visitors can donate to O'Donnell's war fund, learn more about the composer's history in the video games industry, and "join Marty's army" to receive campaign  updates.

The game's disappearance was noticed at the end of last week, though it's still available on Steam and the Microsoft Store.
Some fans have linked Octopath Traveler's delisting due to an apparent change in publisher. Archived versions of the game's eShop product page show that its publisher was changed from Nintendo to Square Enix a some point between 11th February and 1st March.

EA's latest round of layoffs will affect five percent of staff - around 670 employees. The publisher said it planned to move away from "future licensed IP" toward its "owned IP, sports, and massive online communities". EA said this decision would not impact every team at the company directly.


 Now, developer Bit Reactor has shared an update on X, confirming its Star Wars strategy game was "unaffected" by the changes at EA.

Whilst there's been no formal word that the new content – which was bundled in with premium editions of the game – is coming any time soon, similar "unknown apps" were added to prior Bethesda games like Fallout 4, which later turned out to be expansions like Nuka-World and Valut-tec Workshop.
No, this is not definitive proof that any DLC is coming, let alone Shattered Space, but it's our strongest hint yet that additional content is on the way for Starfield fans. So watch this space, eh?

That's according to industry insider Jeff Grubb, who said on yesterday's Game Mess podcast that whilst it wasn't clear when the game would next be shown, "it will be released this year".
"I suspect [Dragon Age: Dreadwolf] ] will probably pop up this summer," Grubb said (thanks, wccftech). "I don't know when it'll be shown, but [I] assume it will be shown sometime this summer. Could happen at any time, though.

<blockquote><p>Prior research suggests that the vampyromorph lived in the shallows off an island that once existed in what is now the heart of the European mainland. The research team believes that the remarkable degree of preservation of this squid is due to unique conditions at the moment of the creature&#8217;s death. Water at the bottom of the sea where it ventured would have been poorly oxygenated, causing the creature to suffocate. In addition to killing the squid, it would have prevented other creatures from feeding on its remains, allowing it to become buried in the seafloor, wholly intact...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

"As Snufkin you will distract police officers, pull out signs, and knock over misplaced statues," explains Norweigian developer Hyper Games, "as you vigorously try to restore nature and the inhabitants' home while putting an end to the industrious Park Keeper's plans."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balatro, the poker-themed rogue-like from solo developer LocalThunk that's been a huge critical and commercial hit since releasing last week, has been unexpectedly yanked from sale in some countries, with publisher Playstack blaming the issue on a surprise ratings change.


Playstack addressed the issue in a lengthy statement shared on social media, explaining Balatro's temporary removal from console stores had so far only happened "some countries". It admitted it could not "estimate with complete confidence which stores" had been impacted, adding, "Our hope is that only a minority of stores will be affected". It says it remains "highly confident" Balatro will remain available on PC, including Steam.


The cause of all this frustration is an unexpected "overnight change" to Balatro's age rating, which has been bumped from 3+ to 18+. According to Playstack, this change stems from an unspecified ratings board's "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'".

No Rest for the Wicked, which was unveiled during last year's The Game Awards, is described by Moon Studios as an "expansive" and "visceral" action-RPG that's "set to reinvent the genre". It casts players as a Cerim - a holy warrior "imbued with remarkable powers" - who embarks on a journey across the harsh Isola Sacra to defeat an unholy plague.


Its campaign promises a "mature, dark" narrative, as well as "brutal, precision-based" combat, and a hand-crafted world, with players can take on No Rest for the Wicked's challenges, quests, and bosses either solo or with up to three friends by their side.

As reported yesterday, employees at Rockstar have been told to return to the office five days a week, now that GTA 6 is entering the final stretch of development. Studio management cited security and productivity reasons for this upcoming change, which will come into effect in April.
Since this announcement, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has blasted Rockstar for its plans to withdraw remote working provisions for the "majority" of its staff, noting the studio said any exceptions to the new rules will be "rare".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two fake Helldivers 2 games popped up on Steam last night, both masquerading as Arrowhead's hit shooter in a bid to scam people into buying their product. Each title listed Arrowhead as its developer, and PlayStation as its publisher.
A message sent around the official Arrowhead Discord this morning warned the community of these fake games, stating that the only legitimate releases were Helldivers 2 and Helldivers 2: Super Citizen Edition with the correct release date of 8th February.
"People posting as us trying to scam people is obviously very sad and frustrating, and for that as well as for security reasons we urge you to stay clear of them," Arrowhead's community manager wrote. "Again, the only two Helldivers 2 products we market are Helldivers 2 and Helldivers 2 Super Citizen Edition."

The strategic platformer MOBA launched on 20th June 2023 on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Since then it's had three seasons of new content, the latest being a crossover with Spyro the Dragon.

Skimmers will let players zoom around looking cool, pull off tricks and even grind on rails. They'll live alongside Sparrows - the game's traditional Star Wars speeder bikes - in your inventory.


As with anything fun or cool, the first hit is free - all players will get a Skimmer as part of the upcoming Guardian Games All-Stars event. A second Skimmer "inspired by a beloved Destiny weapon" will be available to buy via Destiny 2's Eververse microtransaction shop.

Never Yield - also known as Aerial_Knight's Never Yield to ensure you don't forget who developed it - released back in 2021, offering up an experience something like a classic endless runner. It sees players stampeding across a strikingly designed future Tokyo, all to a winning soundtrack created by Detroit artist Danime-Sama.


"Take the role of Wally," explains Never Yield's official description. "A mysterious character that has recovered what was taken from him. Hopefully, you're fast enough to outrun your enemies. Expose the truth and try to uncover the mystery of what happened to them."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors might continue to be suspiciously devoid of vampires, but it does now have a bunch of new cosmic sci-fi bits (clearly last year's Among Us collaboration just wasn't space-y enough), courtesy of its latest free update on Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and mobile.


Space 54, as the update is known, introduces a new bonus stage going by the same name - officially described as a "cosmic border-realm between this plane of existence and a sinister, third dimension" - as well as two new characters to deploy.


One of those characters, Space Dude, is the star of developer Poncle's energetic Space 54 trailer (or Space-54, or Space54 - the studio doesn't seem to have entirely made its mind up), and there's also four new weapons, a new relic, and seven new EXTRA achievements.

One of the most popular ways developers use Kubernetes-related services is via cloud providers, but
have you ever wondered how cloud providers can do that? How does this whole process of integration
of Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let's put the spotlight on SIG
Cloud Provider.
SIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud
providers. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear
standards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes. It is
their responsibility to configure cluster components to enable cloud provider integrations.

Terminator: Survivors is being developed by Nacon Studio Milan, the team behind motorcycle racer Rims Racing and TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3, and is set four years after the catastrophic Judgment Day prophesised in the first two Terminator films.


Cast as a survivor of humanity's near-extinction, players - either working solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - must attempt to "reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating you and the last vestiges of mankind."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toys for Bob - the Activision Blizzard studio behind the likes of Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot 4, and the Spyro remasters - has announced it's parting ways with Activision to become an independent company once more. It also says it's "exploring a possible partnership" with Microsoft as development on its new game gets underway.


Toys for Bob, which was founded back in 1989, formed a publishing partnership with Activision in the 2000s that would lead to the studio's acquisition by the publisher in 2005. Toys for Bob has been part of Activision Blizzard ever since, initially working on the hugely popular toys-to-life Skylanders series before developing 2018 remaster Spyro Reignited Trilogy and 2020's well-received Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. Since then, it's served as a support studio for Call of Duty while also releasing last year's Crash Team Rumble.


Earlier this month, following Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard and subsequent decision to lay off 1,900 workers across its Xbox teams, it was confirmed 86 Toys for Bob employees had lost their jobs. It was also reported the studio's physical office would be shutting down and that remaining staff would transition to working from home. And it's in this context that Toys for Bob has now announced it's splitting from Activision to go independent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports last year that Embracer Group was considering selling Borderlands studio Gearbox as part of its ongoing "comprehensive restructuring programme", it's now being claimed a sale to a third party is in the "late stages" of being finalised.


That's according to Kotaku, which says Gearbox CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford had previously told staff the studio was facing one of three possible scenarios: it would either stay with Embracer, be sold, or would finance a buyout and become independent once more. However, Pitchford reportedly shared an update with employees earlier this week, saying a decision had been made - and that decision, according to Kotaku's sources, was to sell.


The publication understands Gearbox's sale to an unnamed buyer is currently in the "late stages of being finalised", and while Embracer Group - which purchased Gearbox for $363m in 2021 - did not respond to Kotaku's requests for comment, Pitchford deflected the website's inquiries, saying, "We will be thrilled to share whenever we have projects to announce or news to share as we work hard towards our mission to entertain the world."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leap day is now upon us and a couple of games aren't happy about this sudden affront to their usual calendar expectations. Both EA Sports WRC and Theatrhythm Final Bar Line are currently protesting at the arrival of 29th February by refusing to function on consoles - but, luckily for rally fans and beat tappers, there's a pretty straightforward workaround.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line players noticed the Final Fantasy-themed PS4 and Switch rhythm game was failing to connect to Square Enix's servers after the clock struck midnight heralding the arrival 29th February, leaving it functionally unplayable.


Similarly, EA took to social media earlier today to acknowledge Codemasters' World Championship Rally was encountering an "issue on console in which the game may crash on startup." And while it didn't explicitly blame the problem on today's leap year, the publisher's follow-up solution makes it clear 29th February is the culprit.

The month will start out with Fallout 2 to promote Amazon's upcoming Fallout adaptation, which is set to premiere on 12th April. We got a good look at the show in December when Amazon released a teaser trailer, following numerous set leaks and official promotional photos.
If you haven't played it, Fallout 2 is one of the classic RPGs which still holds up today. In 2017, Eurogamer was able to visit Obsidian Entertainment and speak to Feargus Urquhart, Leonard Boyarsky and Tim Cain, who all previously worked on Fallout 1 and 2 whilst at Interplay Productions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony-acquired studio Firesprite has recently suffered high profile exits amid accusations of a toxic workplace culture, Eurogamer has been told, as part of an investigation into the studio begun ahead of the layoffs announced by Sony this week.


The Liverpool-based developer released PlayStation VR2 launch title Horizon Call of the Mountain last year, after being acquired by Sony in 2021. But the impact of crunch for that game's release and changes in the company's senior leadership have subsequently led to discontent within the studio, staff have told Eurogamer - something one source described as "death by a thousand cuts".


Most concerning are reports from sources that two senior leaders from Sony support studio XDev, brought in to help lead Firesprite, have since been accused of sexual discrimination and ageism. A subsequent internal investigation by Sony is said to have resulted in the claims being dismissed as a "misunderstanding".

While you may no longer be able to witness the real event in person, you can always relive it vicariously through your Sims. 
Glasgow's Willy Wonka Experience has gone viral for its emptily-decorated space, its AI-generated scripts, and the random shadowy figure called The Unknown who was scaring children.
The whole thing went so badly, it was cancelled halfway through Saturday after police were called to the event, but not before someone could snap one of the most memorable pictures from it - a sad Oompa Loompa being forced to conduct experiments by event organiser House of Illuminati.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I learned there is a Dungeons and Dragons-like Game Master (GM) working behind the scenes on Helldivers 2.
His name is Joel, and his job title at Arrowhead is, well, Game Master. "We have a lot of systems built into the game where the Game Master has a lot of control over the play experience. It's something that we're continuously evolving based on what's happening in the game," Helldivers 2 game director Johan Pilestedt told PC Gamer.
This continuous evolution has actually seen Joel getting up at unsociable hours to sort out situations when the Helldivers 2 team realised the game wasn't as balanced as it could be. "There have been some sudden moments where maybe one planet was too easy or one was too hard and [Joel] had to get up in the middle of the night to give the Automatons a bit of reinforcement so the players don't take [the planet] too quickly," Pilestedt said.

This hotfix takes aim at several bugs and quirks still lingering in Baldur's Gate 3. This includes a fix for banding and shader issues in cinematics and those times characters claimed to be too busy to talk to you. "They were lying," Larian explained.
Meanwhile, Minthara should no longer refuse to follow along with the party in Acts 2 and 3. In the developer's own words: "You should find her more willing to fall in line now - at least in terms of keeping up. She's still something of a free spirit."

Rockstar was the subject of a high profile hack in 2022, in which over 90 screenshots and videos were released online showing work on the then unannounced GTA 6. Then, last year, the studio released its first official GTA 6 trailer ahead of schedule, after it too leaked online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA's closure of Ridgeline Games last night was a "gut punch", the company's former boss Marcus Lehto has now said. 


Ridgeline - previously led by ex-Halo co-creator Lehto - had been working on a narrative-led Battlefield campaign. The project will now be completed by Need for Speed studio Criterion Games.


Writing on social media platform X last night, Lehto said: "Gut punched to see EA lay off my team. So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its decision to cut six percent of its workforce last March, EA has announced another round of layoffs - this time affecting 5 percent of staff (around 670 employees) - as it moves away from "future licensed IP" toward its "owned IP, sports, and massive online communities".


In an email to staff announcing today's layoffs, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said the cuts were part of a continuing effort to "optimise our global real estate footprint to best support our business". 


In order to achieve its goals, Wilson said EA will be "streamlining [its] company operations", "sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry". Additionally, it'll "double down on our biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paranormal Activity - the found-footage horror series that's spawned seven movies since its debut instalment blew up the box office in 2009 - is being turned into a game by The Mortuary Assistant developer DarkStone Digital horror and renowned indie horror publisher DreadXP.


DreadXP's newly announced Paranormal Activity project, which follows the launch of last year's VR-focused Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul from VRWERX, is being made in conjunction with Paramount Game Studios and promises to "bring the franchise's groundbreaking found-footage style to horror enthusiasts in surprising new ways".


Specifics are limited at this seemingly early juncture, but DarkStone Digital (AKA solo developer Brian Clarke, who's also co-director and creative director of DreadXP) makes mention of a dynamic "haunt system" in the new Paranormal Activity game's press release, said to alter the types and intensity of scares tplayers encounter based on their actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, the iOS and Android version of Activision Blizzard's battle royale hit, is officially getting its worldwide launch on 21st March following a limited release in select counties over the course of the last year.


Warzone Mobile, which is being developed by Activision's Digital Legends, Beenox, Shanghai, and Solid State studios, initially launched in Australia back in November 2022. Following its roll-out across a number of other countries, Activision announced it would be getting its full release in autumn last year - but plans changed in October, when the publisher confirmed it had made the decision to postpone its launch to "spring" 2024 in order to "polish up" the experience.


With Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile's worldwide release now locked down to 21st March, Activision has started talking specifics, confirming the game will launch with two maps: Verdansk - which supports 120-player battle royale matches - and Rebirth Island, which supports 48-player battle royale matches using Gulag-free Resurgence rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the shocking news that the next big Pokémon game is mysteriously set to arrive in 2025. Hey, that sounds a lot like the intro to last week's episode, when we were discussing Switch 2! Say, could Pokémon Legends: Z-A also be set to arrive on Nintendo's next console?
It's been a long time since Nintendo didn't launch a major Pokémon game or expansion in a calendar year, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A's arrival in 2025 certainly looks suspicious - as does yesterday's reveal of the game without any look at actual gameplay.
So, have we just been given another piece of the Switch 2 puzzle? What do we expect to see in the mysterious Z-A when it is fully revealed? And how many bad French-themed Pokémon ideas can we come up with? With me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahmed Best, who's best known for his performance as Jar-Jar Binks in the Star Wars prequels, has issued a cryptic tease that has set Star Wars fans' tongues wagging.


"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in," Best posted on Instagram, alongside a photo of himself clad in a performance capture suit. He accompanied the caption with a string of hashtags:  "#mocap #starwars #jarjarbinks #activision #jedi #sithlord #kelleranbeq"


It's unclear what Best is back in a performance capture suit for, though the mention of Activision has fans pondering whether the actor is secretly working on a new Star Wars game from the publisher, or whether he's performing mo-cap for some kind of Call of Duty crossover.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long old wait for UFO 50 - the 50-strong anthology of 8-bit-inspired games from Spelunky creator Derek Yu's Mossmouth studio - but as the seventh anniversary of its announcement approaches this August, Yu has revealed the promising project is currently on track to release in the second half of this year.


When UFO 50 was announced in 2017, the goal was to launch it the following year; that, obviously, did't happen, with Yu last year explaining the longer-the-expected development time was simply down to the team having wildly underestimated how long it would take to make 50 games, particularly given Spelunky 2 was being made in the middle of it all.


UFO 50, if you're unfamiliar, isn't a mini- or micro-game compilation, but a collection of complete 8-bit game experiences (albeit of varying sizes) created as if from a long-forgotten fictional 80s video game company, with sequels and reappearing characters creating a sense of shared continuity. It promises everything from platformers and shoot 'em ups to puzzle games, roguelites, and RPGs, with over half featuring local multiplayer including co-op and versus play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games has suffered layoffs amid unrest due to relocation and accusations of a "highly toxic company", reports suggest.


Game director Todd Papy left the studio last month, according to LinkedIn. MassivelyOP has since reported a number of other high profile losses at the company (via Game Developer), including lead producer Jake Ross, level designer Dane Kubicka, Austin QA lead Vincent Sinatra, and Austin senior QA analyst Andrew Rexroth.




Further, former producer Annie Bouffard shared on LinkedIn that she had resigned from a "highly toxic company" and claimed she was "gaslighted" when she expressed concern about potential layoffs. She said mass layoffs had been disguised as a "relocation of staff" when few were able or willing to move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're now 20 years on from the release of The Simpsons: Hit & Run and we're still without a sequel. That said, we now have a nightmarish glimpse into what could have been, perhaps, with a Mario Kart parody sequence in the latest episode of the animated series. 
Episode 12 of season 35, Lisa Gets an F1, aired on 25th February, and follows Lisa as she becomes a professional kid go-kart racer whilst dealing with her anxiety stemming from Homer's dangerous driving. As Homer worries about Lisa's safety, one night he has a nightmare where he, Lisa, and a number of other children are driving in an off-kilter version of Mario Kart.
"It's me, Lisa Mario," Lisa proclaims at the starting line of Rainbow Road, fully decked out with a blue hat, moustache, and her dress altered to look like Mario's overalls. She's joined by Ralph dressed up as Toad, Nelson tranformed into Bowser, and one of the Mackleberry twins as Princess Peach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new documentary has shed more light on Resident Evil 4 Remake's development, and shows its director concerned the game would not be ready for its release date.
A recent episode of 100 Cameras - a Japanese documentary series which puts 100 cameras in situ to capture the goings on in any given place - focused on Capcom. Along with a look behind the scenes of Street Fighter 6, the episode also showed a slice of Resident Evil 4 Remake's development (thanks, GamesRadar).
At the time of recording, there was only one month left before Resident Evil 4 Remake was set to release, but the game was reportedly riddled with a "storm" of issues. These included game freezes, visual glitches such as characters' hands not connecting when they are meant to be holding on to each other, and Leon getting sent to "another dimension" as he falls through the floor. One tester said they had found "around 70" new bugs in one day. Things were once so bad, Resident Evil 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Anpo admitted: "At this rate, we won't make the release".

Persona 3 Reload released last month as a remake of the 2006 original. However, it was criticised for being incomplete without the inclusion of The Answer expansion and the female protagonist featured in revised versions Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable.


The latest hint to an expansion comes from YouTuber Faz (thanks PCGamer), who discovered an in-game message for completing the game on the highest Merciless difficulty (or at least using a cheat engine to skip ahead).

An overview of the two resulting reports, originally written in Norwegian, by ScienceNorway.no reveals children the pair spoke to worried about being bullied and being unable to make friends unless they spent money to buy cosmetic items (thanks, Crossplay).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over seven years since Limbo and Inside developer Playdead first began teasing its mysterious third project, and now - nearly five years since Eurogamer last has cause to write about a sneaky bit of concept art - the studio has shared a handful of new images, confirming (in case there was any doubt) the project is still alive and well.


A first enigmatic bit of concept art for Playdead's untitled third game was shared by the developer in 2017, around six months after Inside launched to critical acclaim. At the time, the studio confirmed work was underway on its "next adventure", with the accompanying artwork pointing to a lonely adventure with sci-fi undertones.


Since then, further bits of atmospheric concept art have sporadically surfaced - first on social media in 2018, then buried in some online job listings in 2019, then on LinkedIn last year - all seemingly pointing to an adventure in which a lone space traveller wanders a desolate planet strewn with abandoned tech. About all we've conclusively learned of the mysterious project in that time, again thanks to Playdead's jobs page, is that it's a "third-person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe."

Deck Nine is perhaps best known as the current steward of Square Enix's supernatural narrative adventure series Life is Strange, having created 2017's Life is Strange: Before the Storm, 2021's Life is Strange: True Colours, and a remaster of series originator Don't Nod's acclaimed first instalment in 2022. More recently it co-developed a prequel to popular sci-fi TV show The Expanse alongside the revived Telltales Games.


Deck Nine confirmed its decision to lay off a fifth of its staff - likely around 30 employees based on its most recently shared headcount - in a statement on social media, writing, "Like many others in the games industry right now, Deck Nine has been affected by the game industry's worsening market conditions. Today we made the difficult decision to lay off 20% of our staff."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones, the oft-delayed pirate game from Ubisoft that finally arrived earlier this month following almost a decade of development, has released its first season of post-launch content on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC - introducing, among other things, new world events, new contracts and bounties, plus a battle-pass-style progression track.


Raging Tides, as Skull and Bones' first live-service season is officially titled, predominantly focuses on new antagonist Philippe La Peste (AKA the Plague King) and his Fleet of Pestilence. By defeating La Peste's advance guard, the Plaguebringers, as they spawn throughout the world, players can raise the fleet's hostility level. Once past a certain threshold, they'll face a "mighty foe", which rewards a "rare item" when sunk.


That's the core of Raging Tides' new content, then, but Season 1 also adds two elite boss Kingpin Bounties - Jaws of Retribution: Introducing Zamaharibu and Anguish from the Abyss: Rode Maangodin - which run from 5-26th March and 26th March to 16th April respectively.

As part of its release date anouncement, EA teases F1 24 will feature an "overhauled" Career mode, a new Dynamic Handling System, and more, but says it's saving specific details for a full reveal "in the coming months". However, for those players happy to hand over money without knowing more, the publisher has today detailed a number of F1 24 pre-order bonuses.


Two versions of F1 24 are now available to pre-order: the Standard Edition (containing 5,000 Pitcoin and an F1 World Starter Pack) plus the F1 24 Champions Edition, which includes two new Formula 1 Icons, 18,000 Pitcoin, the F1 World Bumper Pack, a bonus VIP Podium Pass, and up to three days of early access starting from 28th May.

Reynatis wasn't present in the showcase for overseas, but yesterday NIS America announced it'll also be released outside of Japan on Nintendo Switch, PC (Steam), PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
The announcement trailer gives us a flavour of the magic-infused world of Reynatis, set in contemporary Shibuya.  The immediate vibes the trailer gives off are Kingdom Hearts meets The World Ends With You, with some hints of Final Fantasy Versus 13 and Kingdom Hearts 3's game-within-a-game Verum Rex. You have my attention, Reynatis.

The latter is an obstacle course mini-game similar to those found within Fortnite's user-made Creative mode already - think along the lines of its many parkour levels or popular Only Up maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is to lay off 900 people, equating to eight percent of its workforce. This reduction will see PlayStation Studios' London Studio close in its entirety, plus reductions made within Sony's Firesprite studio. There will also be reductions in various functions across SIE in the UK
In a post earlier today, Sony's Jim Ryan said the company's PlayStation community meant "everything to us", and therefore it felt compelled to share an update on the current situation.
"We have made the extremely hard decision to announce our plan to commence a reduction of our overall headcount globally by about eight percent or about 900 people, subject to local law and consultation processes. Employees across the globe, including our studios, are impacted," Ryan wrote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A number of developers have said they are concerned about the future of Apple Arcade, with one person stating there is "the smell of death" around the mobile game subscription service.


A source told mobilegamer.biz that Apple had "cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people" following a 'reboot' of the subscription in 2021. Other sources, meanwhile, said the company had been steadily cutting developer payouts and upfront fees over recent years.


"We're going to see that amount and decrease and decrease and decrease until it's pennies," one developer told the publication. "At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable." Reportedly, when Apple Arcade launched in 2019, it was a different story, with "very generous" upfront and per-play payments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "biggest regret" of the developer behind Cities: Skylines 2 is the game's ongoing lack of modding support, Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen has said.
Writing in the studio's latest developer diary, posted on publisher Paradox Interactive's forum, Hallikainen also detailed the changes Colossal is now looking into based on player feedback.
The city-builder sequel released in October last year on PC and was immediately criticised by players for its performance issues and, yes, missing official mod support. In response to fan complaints the game's launch had been a "mess" and a "disaster", Hallikainen admitted Colossal would "much rather be in a different position than we are in the moment, but we cannot change the past".

The update comes ahead of the release of Rebirth later this week and additionally makes a change in Remake to Tifa's outfit seen in a certain flashback to ensure consistency across both games.


But why amend this specific line from Aerith? Fans are now debating, as spotted on ResetEra. The ending of Final Fantasy 7 Remake is discussed below.

Social media user PeterOvo shared a screenshot from a video comparison capturing the frames per second performance between Pentiment on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The former was running at 120fps, while the Xbox version was running at a mere 60fps.
This inconsistency was subsequently brought to the attention of Pentiment's director, Josh Sawyer. The developer replied to assure players that 120fps will be enabled for Xbox "in the next patch".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ark: Survival Ascended developer Studio Wildcard has announced it's indefinitely delaying the release of the dinosaur survival remaster's enhanced The Center expansion, just days before its planned 28th February release.


Ark: Survival Ascended - the controversial full-price Unreal Engine 5 remaster of 2015's Ark: Survival Evolved - has been plagued with delays since its announcement last year. First, the remaster's launch was shifted from August to October - a release it eventually managed to hit on PC, albeit with the Xbox Series X/S version getting a last-minute delay to mid-November and the PS5 release arriving later still - while Ascended's various expansion remasters, originally due to launch alongside the base game, have now slipped a number of times.


In January, Wildcard announced its Scorched Earth expansion remaster, initially delayed to December 2023 and then moved to March 2024, would now be releasing in April, while its Aberration and Ragnarok map remasters - previously delayed to "Q1 2024" - were now on track to arrive in July and September 2024 respectively. Amid all this furious roadmap revision, there was a bright spot in that the enhanced version of Ark's The Center map would now be coming to Ascended a couple of months earlier than listed in December. The Center's release was later pinned down to 28th February, but once again it's all change.

Mike and Sulley arrive as part of what Gameloft is officially calling the Laugh Floor Update, and both make their Dreamlight Valley debut via a new playable Realm - giving players the chance to experience a day-in-the-life at Monsters, Inc. before the duo become available as villagers - each with their own friendship quests and associated rewards.


Other features coming in this week's Laugh Floor Update, as detailed in Gameloft's newly shared patch notes, include more avatar customisation options - ranging from new skin tones and special eye contacts to new ear styles - plus an expansion to Scrooge McDuck's shop, meaning players will see more items to spend their in-game gold on each day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley is celebrating its eighth anniversary today (yes, I couldn't believe it either) and developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has marked the occasion by announcing a release date for his beloved farm-life sim's eagerly awaited 1.6 update - which is coming to PC on 19th March, with a console and mobile release to follow "as soon as possible".


Stardew Valley's 1.6 update was revealed to be in the works back in June 2022, when Barone warned it would be relatively modest in scope and 'mostly modding-focused'. Since then, however, it's ballooned substantially, with Barone so far confirming it'll bring one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and crafting recipes, new dialogue lines, a new farm type, new late-game content, winter outfits for villagers, a new larger chest, 8-player co-op on PC, plus - most importantly of all - hats for cats and dogs.


It was exactly one month ago today that Barone last shared a progress report on 1.6's development, revealing he was "done adding major new content" and that it would "definitely" release this year - and we now have an exact date to mark in our calendars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What the Golf? developer Triband is bringing its absurdist racing game What the Car? to Steam later this year, following its debut last May as an Apple Arcade exclusive.


What the Car? follows in the wonderfully daft footsteps of What the Golf? - and indeed its VR-exclusive baseball-inspired successor What the Bat? - by taking a relatively sensible sport (in this case racing) and sillying it up to the extreme.


If you've long been of the opinion racing games would be a whole lot better if the cars had legs and the racing was spiced up a bit with some cooking, rope jumpinga, CAR-aoke, or even fishing, then What the Car? is probably just what you're looking for.

Co-op has now been confirmed for Rise of the Ronin via the game's FAQ section (spotted by Okami13_ on X), which states players can join up to three others in online co-op. The FAQs also confirm there will be no PvP in Rise of the Ronin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is currently set to launch its under-wraps Switch 2 console in March 2025 - but this could be delayed further, a new report has cautioned. 


The fresh report, this time from Japanese newspaper Nikkei, has further confirmed this month's reports that Switch 2 will now arrive next year, after having previously been set for a late 2024 launch. 


Eurogamer sources told us previously that a delay to 2025 was intended to ensure Switch 2 arrived with a robust game line-up, something Nikkei's report also mentions. Nikkei additionally suggests a move to 2025 will ensure Switch 2 console stock will also be more readily available.

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of detail in the Apple <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">blog post</a>, and more in Douglas Stabila&#8217;s <a href="https://security.apple.com/assets/files/Security_analysis_of_the_iMessage_PQ3_protocol_Stebila.pdf">security analysis</a>.</p>
<p>I am of two minds about this. On the one hand, it&#8217;s probably premature to switch to any particular post-quantum algorithms. The mathematics of cryptanalysis for these lattice and other systems is still rapidly evolving, and we&#8217;re likely to break more of them&#8212;and learn a lot in the process&#8212;over the coming few years. But if you&#8217;re going to make the switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple&#8217;s ability to do this so efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably more important than its particular cryptographic design. And it is probably about the right time to worry about, and defend against, attackers who are storing encrypted messages in hopes of breaking them later on future quantum computers...</p>]]></summary>

Whilst the game was never formally cancelled, it was never released, either, which makes the footage – which is complete with voicework from series stalwart Stephen Fry and the costumes and gameplay long associated with the family-friendly platformer – all the more surprising.
"LittleBigPlanet Hub beta official gameplay full walkthrough recorded in 2013," is all the YouTube video's description says, with a later Short from the same account alleging that the build was still live and could still be downloaded.

Whilst the director wouldn't be drawn on what, exactly, that "small element" entailed or where players should be looking, Miyazaki said the team was "always surprised and delighted by how much the players do discover, and how much these communities work to uncover these secrets".
Talking to IGN, Miyazaki said that whether it was up to interpretation or "just further investigation", fans needed to look a little harder to find it.

In a short video message shared on social media (as spotted by VGC), Lost Crown director Mounir Radi thanked fans for their support, saying, "It means the world to us seeing you enjoy your time with the game just as much as we do. Which is why, I'm especially pleased to let you know that we are far from being done".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly preparing to launch a new white, digital-only version of its top-end Xbox Series X console in "June or July" this year.


An "adorably all-digital" Xbox Series X refresh, planned for a 2024 release, first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year's court battle with the FTC. However, Xbox boss Phil Spencer later insisted "so much has changed" since the plans detailed in the leak had been drawn up, leaving the all-digital console's future uncertain.


But now, noted leaker eXtas1s (writing for Exputer) has claimed that not only are Microsoft's all-digital Xbox Series X plans still alive, the console is set to release "sometime between the upcoming months of June and July" - although "chances for a slight delay" remain.

In its free weekend round two announcement, Hello Games says its first attempt "worked better than expected" and No Man's Sky "started the year with more players than we've EVER had at this time of year", adding, "Our large and friendly community did us proud and jumped at the opportunity to welcome these new Travellers with open arms and show them the ropes."


As before, No Man's Sky's free weekend is open to players on all platforms - Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC - and the latest festivities conclude on Monday, 26th February. Any progress made during the event will be carried over to the full game if you're convinced enough that you decide to make a purchase, and the previous 50 percent discount is still available across digital storefronts, meaning you can pick it up for around £19.99.

The game was the latest in the SteamWorld series that turned to strategy and base building gameplay, and was released at the start of December last year.


During the company's latest financial reporting, Thunderful CEO Martin Walfisz put the blame on genre choice not being suited to the Switch, where the series is traditionally stronger (thanks Game Developer). That's despite the game's sales contributing to a record high Q4.

<blockquote><p>LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable and can now interact with tools (i.e., call functions), read documents, and recursively call themselves. As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.</p>
<p>In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLMs...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

During a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said Rocksteady's recent release had "fallen short of our expectations" (thanks, IGN).
The executive did not share any sales figures for Suicide Squard: Kill the Justice League during this call, but admitted it had left the company with a "tough year" ahead when it comes to year-on-year comparisons. Last year, Warner Bros. published Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy, the latter of which became the best selling game in the US in 2023.

In an update on Steam, the Nightingale team said its vision was always to "create an interconnected series of Realms, with the idea of allowing for co-operative exploration in mind - a universe bigger than a single Realm or server". 
As such, the studio made the decision early on to support co-op from day one, rather than focus on an offline mode.

This discussion has been prompted by the apparent emergence of an early plan for Spider-Man 2's story shared on reddit, originating from the files stolen by hackers who targeted Insomniac Games. In that early draft, one particular plot element was different - sparking debate now on whether it was a good thing Insomniac apparently changed its mind. 
Please note, the rest of this article will contain major spoilers for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Please read on at your own discretion.

If you're in any doubt, it's pronounced how it's spelled, Riot said over on X. Previously it had been referred to as Project L.
I'm going to assume the name is supposed to mean "two KOs", given 2XKO is a 2v2 tag-based fighting game. That also means my brain will call the game 2KO rather than 2XKO. I'm starting to fear this might be a "née Project L" situation...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Games has announced crossplay will be added to Mortal Kombat 1 in a patch next week, which is also when John Cena's Peacemaker will be available in early access.
Crossplay, er I mean Krossplay, will be available for players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam and Epic Games Store) from 28th February. Players of the heavily criticised Nintendo Switch version of Mortal Kombat 1 will miss out on 1v1 Kombat League and Kasual matches, 1v1 private matches, and leaderboard stats across the other platforms.
On 28th February, Peacemaker will be available to play as in early access for those who've bought the Kombat Pack. Warner Bros. Games released a gameplay trailer for Peacemaker, where we get to see him using his helmet and its abilities in combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cult classic strategy game revival Solium Infernum is now available on Steam, as its developer League of Geeks continues to face an uncertain future. 


This new version of Solium Infernum - where you aim to claim the Infernal Throne of Hell by navigating political intrigue, military strategy and beytrayal - boasts an all-new single-player campaign and asynchronous multiplayer, alongside a visual refresh. 


But behind the scenes, its developer's fate seems to remain uncertain. League of Geeks, previously behind the well-received strategy board game Armello, suffered layoffs in December, with around half of its 70-something team let go.

Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse described plans for this official support as "robust", but did not yet give an exact date for when it will arrive - other than to say it was planned for sometime this year. 


"We have a system but it needs to be tested and still requires work," Douse explained, noting that the team wanted to avoid any player frustration from game updates breaking mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld has reached an astonishing 25m players within its first month. 
The numbers, revealed by developer Pocketpair, also confirm 15m players jumped into the action-adventure, monster-taming, survival game on Steam. The other 10m have dived in on Xbox, though Pocketpair didn't specify how many of these were players who bought a copy of the game versus how many were playing via Xbox Game Pass. 
15m copies of Palworld sold on Steam will have made Pocketpair about $315m, which is around £250m, after taking off Valve's 30 percent cut. That money will surely go a long way to helping Pocketpair with its $500k a month spending on servers, as well as hiring developers to no longer be "overwhelmingly short of people".

Many fans had expected former WWE boss McMahon and frequent WWE champion Lesnar to be cut from the game's playable roster as a result, despite the title's focus on the past 40 years of Wrestlemania. Indeed, earlier this month, Lesnar was spotted by fans as having been quietly removed from artwork used on the game's cover. 

2K published the final roster yesterday on its website via a simple blog post. 204 wrestlers will be available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming Cate Blanchett-fronted Borderlands film is the start of a "Borderlands Cinematic Universe",  according to Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford. 


Speaking with IGN about the recent Borderlands trailer, Pitchford discussed the film's place in the video game universe, saying it "lives side by side". 


"Of course, the characters are there and authentic in the themes and even some of the storylines. But they're independent storylines," Pitchford told the publication, stating the film isn't either Borderlands 1 or 2. Rather, it is "the first of the Borderlands Cinematic Universe", which means fans of the series will "see some characters from some of the different parts of what you might know from the video games".

Game director Johan Pilestedt revealed the game's new concurrent user cap now stands at 700,000 players, via a post on X. Helldivers 2 is expected to hit this number, although he added: "We believe that the wait times will be much more bearable".


Patch notes on Steam confirm the raised server cap, as well as a fix for an issue where players would get stuck in cinematics.

Nintendo itself is yet to say anything certain about its inevitable Switch successor, but its steady path towards launch has been tracked by numerous reports. Now, we discuss how this latest news unfolded, why we believe it has happened, and what this means for Nintendo across the rest of 2024.
Plus: some fun speculation on what we hope Nintendo will change for its new hardware (get rid of Joy-Con stick drift, please?) With me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To borrow from Game of Thrones, Minter is coming (please read that in Ned Stark's voice). Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story - an interactive documentary experience for PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch - will release next month, on 13th March. 


Coming from Digital Eclipse, this upcoming release invites us all to take a little trip back in time, to "an era of cassette tapes, photocopied zines, and README.TXT", as it tells the story of the British game designer's career. So, expect plenty of psychedelia, radioactive sheep, mutant camels and more.  


Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story will include 42 classic games from across eight different platforms. An interactive timeline will reach all the way back to some of Minter's earliest work on the Sinclair ZX81 and Commodore VIC-20, before heading onto projects for the Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari 800, the Atari ST line of computers and Atari's Jaguar console of the 90s.

The actor is known for many roles across the video game industry, including Karl Heisenberg in Resident Evil Village. More recently, he played Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3, for which he won the award for Best Performance at last year's Game Awards.


Newbon's role in Fallout: London is still largely underwraps, with the mod's developer simply stating he is part of the voice acting team, as an in-game screenshot is shared (see below).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After several years of silence, Little Devil Inside has resurfaced. You may need to cast your minds back to remember this one. Little Devil Inside first came to light - at least on Eurogamer - back in 2015, when the game achieved its Kickstarter funding goal, although trailers had floated about before then. 


Things then went quiet, before it popped back up in 2020 at a PlayStation 5 reveal event. The following year, we got word that Little Devil Inside would release towards the end of 2022, which evidently did not happen. 


Now, developer Neostream has re-emerged with its first Kickstarter post in four years and a new teaser for Little Devil Inside. The post reads a tad awkwardly, and I suspect it has been run through translation software before being published. However, it appears that there has been quite a lot happening behind the scenes at Neostream, with a some kind of disagreement happening between members of the development team.

However, there are now numerous reports online of players encountering more issues than before. "The recent patches screwed the game, for a lot of people," one reddit user acknowledged when another player said their copy of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League now wasn't loading past a black screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi-Fi Rush will skip the current Nintendo Switch and instead arrive on the console's currently-unannounced successor. 
That's according to a report from Insider Gaming, which states that the absence of a Switch version of the game in yesterday's Xbox multi-platform announcement was due to it launching on Nintendo Switch 2 instead.


Whether Hi-Fi Rush could still eventually launch for the current Switch as well - perhaps at the same time? - is unclear, the report concluded.


Certainly, a launch for Hi-Fi Rush on a Nintendo platform has been expected. Earlier this year, in-game clothing designs seemed to point to the rhythm action game going multi-platform in the near future. This apparent tease preceded any other multi-platform plans being discussed publicly by Microsoft, and the decision to launch four games on other consoles ultimately being laid out this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree will be available digitally only, even for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S exclusive physical versions.


A Shadow of the Erdtree Edition will be released, including both the base game and the DLC. However this will only be available physically on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the expansion an additional download not on the disc. PC editions are digitally only, while PS4 and Xbox One will only have the DLC as a digital extra.


The DLC, as a standalone addition, will cost £34.99 across all platforms - a significant increase from, say, Bloodborne's The Old Hunters DLC that was £15.99 on release. This perhaps speaks to the size of Shadow of the Erdtree as much as the rising cost of games.

Dead Island 2 publisher Plaion has now confirmed the news, though in a blog post noted the game was "for Ultimate members". Users have noted that the game's PC version was not added to Game Pass for PC.


The unexpected addition to Game Pass follows a free weekend of access to Dead Island 2 via Xbox's "Free Play Days" promotion last week.

Other points from this latest Helldivers 2 patch include a number of crash fixes. Players should no longer get stuck in the defrosting or in the ship intro cinematic, as well.

The Hi-Fi Rush PS5 launch date was today revealed to be 18th March, courtesy of a new trailer for the rhythm action game posted to Bethesda's Latin American YouTube channel. 


That video appears to have gone live a little earlier than planned, as it was soon taken offline by Bethesda - but not before the internet noticed. You can watch it via the embed below, now re-uploaded to social media:

Prison Architect 2 - the sequel to the hugely popular 2015 original from developer Introversion Software (who sold the rights to Paradox in 2019) - was announced back in January, promising a take on the prison management formula reimagined in full 3D.


There was talk of some rather nifty looking multi-floor building, and a new connection system defining and impacting the relationships prisoners had with other inmates. All of that was originally due to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th March, but eager sorts will now need to wait until May following today's delay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidetaka Miyazaki didn't envision originating an entire genre. Yet such is the popularity of the Dark Souls games - right up to the more recent Elden Ring - that they've become collectively known in the gaming community as Soulslikes. That's shorthand for games with calculating combat, high levels of challenge and repeated death, though this is of course reductive of the awe and grim majesty Miyazaki's games evoke.


Soulslikes are everywhere now. From indie games utilising specific mechanics, to larger projects specifically trying to out-do FromSoftware at its own game. That's testament to the influence of Miyazaki's work, though he remains humble when discussing his oeuvre with me ahead of announcing the release of Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring's upcoming major expansion.


"We certainly didn't come up with the term Souslike and we didn't envision it as a new genre or a new term for the industry," he tells me. "So of course when it first started cropping up... we were very surprised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FromSoft boss Hidetaka Miyazaki has discussed the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, and the benefits of waiting for new hardware on which to revisit the beloved PlayStation 4 classic.


"It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans," Miyazaki told Eurogamer when questioned about the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, in an interview timed alongside today's proper unveiling of the Elden Ring DLC. "It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it."


But would a remake benefit from newer hardware to make the release worthwhile? FromSoftware's Demon's Souls, for example, was remade as a PS5 launch title after originally launching on PS3 - a double console generation leap that meant the re-release felt more significant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's February Direct Partner Showcase has come and gone. This presentation was focused around third-party games so, as expected, there was no news on any homegrown Nintendo titles or the Switch 2's expected arrival in early 2025. However, the broadcast was still full of annoucements for games headed to Nintendo Switch from other publishers over the coming six months. Here's a roundup of everything which appeared during the 25-minute show.
Fresh from Microsoft's confirmation it was bringing more of its Xbox console exclusives to other platforms, the show began with a look at Obsidian's Grounded - where you have to explore a massive garden as a tiny human. Grounded will support online cross-platform multiplayer on Switch when it's released on 16th April.
After this, we entered the dying world of Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist. You take on the role of Lilac as she explores the landscape alongside a homunculus (Fullmetal Alchemist vibes anyone?). Ender Magnolia Bloom will be released on the Nintendo Switch later this year.

Launching exclusively for Nintendo Switch on 25th June, this new entry in the series features an online mode where up to 16 players can rush forth simultaneously across obstacles and towards each level's goal. It looks rather like Fall Guys!


Another big change with Banana Rumble is the addition of a Spin Dash move, which lets you charge forward and skip over short gaps. There's a new co-op Adventure Mode, too, and the ability to customise your chimp with over 300 options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And just like that, my excitement for Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has gone from bubbling anticipation to a fever pitch scream; alongside a first gameplay trailer for FromSoftware's eagerly awaited expansion, publisher Namco Bandai has now shared a release date, confirming it'll be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 21st June.


But first that trailer, offering a full three-minute look at Shadow of the Erdtree, and the sprawling expanses of almost inevitable death and gleefully masochistic misery within. There are fields of wheat tainted with spectral tomb stones, gloomy swamps, and striking ruins high on hills - and what gameplay reveal trailer would be complete without a tease of the imposing enemies that'll no doubt be the cause of that aforementioned death and misery?


As for what it's all about, well, the specifics remain something of a mystery, although Miquella - long speculated to be the focus of the expansion - while not especially prominent in this reveal (possibly because he's currently stuck in an egg), does sort of appear, and there are further hints he's maybe not as benevolent as some might claim. Let the lore theorising begin!

Switch owners have, of course, already had a chance to sample the Monster Hunter Stories series when its acclaimed second outing launched on Nintendo's platform in 2021. However, Nintendo's latest Direct has revealed the original game - first released for 3DS back in 2016 - is getting a thorough spruce-up for modern audiences.


Monster Hunter Stories 1 casts players as a Monster Rider, setting them loose in a colourful, cartoony rendition of the series' universe to indulge in some classic RPG-style questing and Pokémon-esque monster collecting, battling, and rearing - and very good it is too.

In Japan, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will also get Mother 3 - the third entry in the legendary Earthbound series which has never made it to the West. 


All of these games were announced in this afternoon's Nintendo Direct broadcast - though Mother 3 was only mentioned in the show's Japanese version. Sorry, rest of the world.

        <updated>2024-02-21T14:20:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following last week's long-rumoured announcement Microsoft is bringing four of its previously Xbox-exclusive first-party games to Switch and PlayStation 5, we've finally got official confirmation of the first two games making that multiplatform leap: Obsidian's historical narrative adventure Pentiment comes to Switch tomorrow, 22nd February, while inch-high garden adventure Grounded arrives 16th April on Nintendo's platform.


Starting with Pentiment, it cast players as Andreas Maler, a master artist who finds himself embroiled in murders, scandals, and intrigue over a period of five years in 16th century Bavaria. It's fantastic stuff - Eurogamer's Christian Donlan called it a "brilliant narrative adventure that is filled with intelligence and heart" in his Recommended review back in November 2022 - and the choice-driven adventure is paired with a striking art style, inspired by the great manuscripts and the earliest printed books of the time.


As for Grounded, Microsoft's second Switch-bound Xbox title, it's a wonderful co-op-imbued survival and crafting adventure with a distinctly 80s twist, taking a leaf out of cinema favourite Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. As in that movie, Grounded's four protagonists are miniaturised and left to fend for themselves in a sprawling backyard garden, building bases and crafting armour to forge ahead against deadly bugs, fish, and other wildlife.

This showcase will last around 25 minutes, and feature games coming to Nintendo Switch in the first half of 2024 from Nintendo's publishing and development partners. Hit refresh on this page at 2pm and you will be able to watch it below!

So, what do we expect? Well, it might be easier to say what we're not expecting to pop up here. As this is a partner Direct, don't expect any big announcements from Nintendo itself - or from Pokémon, which has its own broadcast scheduled for next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox boss Phil Spencer has addressed lingering questions around the company stance on physical media following last year's leaks of an "adorably all-digital" Xbox Series X refresh, saying Microsoft continues to be "supportive" of the medium, and insisting "getting rid of physical, that's not a strategic thing for us."


An all-digital (and distinctly cylindrical) new Xbox Series X design first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year's court battle with the FTC over its Activision Blizzard acquisition plans. However, when Spencer later acknowledged the leak, he called its contents "old emails and documents", insisting that "so much has changed".


But still, the possibility of an all-digital new Xbox has continued to loom, whether that be a mid-cycle refresh or a future console, particularly following news of major layoffs acoss Microsoft's games retail teams. And Spencer has now shed a little more light on Microsoft's perspective on physical media as part of an interview for journalist Stephen Totilo's Game File.

Just shy of two years since the launch of FromSoftware's magisterial open-world action-adventure, publisher Bandai Namco has confirmed it'll be sharing more on the game's eagerly awaited DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, later today, with early rumours pointing to a June launch.


But first the confirmed stuff; over on its social media channels, Bandai Namco has formally announced Shadow of the Erdtree will be getting a first gameplay reveal as part of a three-minute long YouTube "presentation" today, 21st February, at 3pm UK time/4pm CET/7am PST.


And here we enter into less substantiated territory, with reliable Deallabs leaker billbil-kun (who has an impressive track record when it comes to accurately reporting unannounced PlayStation news) claiming Shadow of the Erdtree will launch on 21st June.

Her arrival in the game marks something of a full-circle moment for the global music megastar, after her social media post in October 2019 simply asking "What's Fortnite" went viral. Five years on, Lady Gaga's account reposted her original message today with an image of her upcoming in-game character model, and the correction: "*fortnite".


The image is labelled with Fortnite Festival, which is the game's Rock Band/Guitar Hero-style rhythm game mode that launched late last year. Festival's second season kicks off this Thursday, 22nd February, following its first season that spotlighted The Weeknd.

This includes the excellent Tales of Arise, the epic role-playing game from Bandai Namco's Tales studio that originally launched to a warm reception back in 2021. "There are missteps and a few bumps along the way, but this soft reboot of a long-running series emerges a triumph," we wrote in Eurogamer's Tales of Arise review.


Younger subscribers (or Xbox Game Pass owners with kids) will likely be keen to know that Bluey: The Video Game comes to the subscription this Thursday, 22nd February. You can explore the Heeler House and playground, plus play keepy uppy and Chattermax Chase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is expected to launch a souped up version of the PlayStation 5 later this year, analysts have suggested.


A new CNBC report notes that there was now "broad concensus in the game industry that Sony is indeed preparing a launch of a PS5 Pro in the second half of 2024," quoting Tokyo-based games analyst Serkan Toto.


However, the report cautions that Sony is unlikely to see a large uptick in PS5 sales year-on-year as a result of the Pro's launch, and is also unlikely to cut the cost of the base PS5 model as a result. (Sony, unsurprsingly, has not commented on CNBC's report.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Need for Speed team is celebrating the franchise's 30th anniversary with another year of live service content for its most recent release, Unbound.
"Surprise! We're still here," developer Criterion Games shared in a new blog post, where it detailed Need for Speed: Unbound's year two roadmap. "NFS turns 30 this year, and with that huge legacy, we couldn't stand idle. However, this year will be a bit different from the previous one."
