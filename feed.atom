        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 developer Bungie is making changes to its transmog system.
After "monitoring [players'] reception and behaviour" concerning the sci-fi shooter's divisive and time-consuming transmog system, Bungie says that from Season 15, one of the currencies used to purchase transmog bounties from Ada-1, Synthstrand, will be deprecated. Instead, you'll be able to purchase Ada's bounties for 10,000 Glimmer.
"Since the launch of Season of the Splicer we have been monitoring reception and behaviour around our new Armor Synthesis system," the studio said in its weekly blog update. "Today we'd like to review a minor update around the system's currencies.

Though not yet formally announced by developer miHoYo, the news comes via trusted Twitter account Genshin Report, and though we don't know much about the new fishing mechanic - nor how Watasumi will come into play - they did also share renders of three characters already announced to be joining the roster, too: Ball, Kokomi, and Sara.
Genshin Report also teased what they believe to be a new boss called La Signora, including a sneaky, and blurry, screenshot of her in action. Take a look below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has once again renewed the trademark for its PS3-era social space, PlayStation Home.
The filing - which was reportedly submitted on 21st July 2021, according to a Redditor who's keeping a close eye on the situation - has secured the European trademark up until 1st October 2028. Though little else is available on the trademark application's webpage, it's still logged as "goods and services", and categorised as "computer game software".
Though there's presently no official confirmation either way that Sony might be looking to relaunch Home - or at least some kind of version of it - it's the third such rumour to have surfaced in as many months, leading some to think it may have something to do with "a return to PSVR 2" (thanks, Comic Book) that would dovetail nicely into large-scale social events, such as those we've seen in Fortnite. Add in VR compatibility, and it could be a very exciting development indeed.

According to an IGN interview with creative director Roman Campos-Oriola, original developer Visceral Games was seemingly forced to make changes to the game's initial plans due to "technical constraints". 
Now, however, the Motive team will be using the "original level design", which may give us a peek at the studio's early plans that changed during development.

Though not officially confirmed by developer/publisher Ubisoft, the second DLC instalment seemingly popped up on an Italian Windows store and was promptly screen-capped before the announcement was removed again.
While all we can do is chalk this up as an unsubstantiated rumour for now, the screencap - shared via CriptAssassINI (thanks, NME) - certainly looks convincing.

Though some prospective Steam Deckers were concerned at the use of the word "targeting", Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais took to Twitter to emphasise that the hardware wasn't targeting 30 FPS as much as it was suggesting 30 FPS is the minimum Steam Deck users can expect.
All the games that have been tested on Steam Deck thus far have reportedly "consistently met and exceeded" 30 FPS, plus there'll also be an optional FPS limiter to enable players to choose between framerates and prolonging the mobile device's battery life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the 1990s, Iraqi programmer and designer Auday Hussein worked on an Amiga adaptation of the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest surviving work of literature. He was kind enough to talk me through this amazing project earlier this year, discussing his first experiments with the MSX and Amiga, what it was like learning about programming in Baghdad during the rule of the Ba'ath Party, the challenges of visualising the Gilgamesh universe, and the possibility of releasing the partly completed game today.
Hussein also shared a video of the game, which now has the working title "Kingdom of Death". It's a beautiful and atmospheric action-adventure set in the underworld, with a wonderful monster bestiary and thoughtful puzzles tied to cuneiform inscriptions. You can read much more in the full feature, but here's the video by itself if you'd rather cut to the chase.
An excerpt from the article, for context: "It's a 2D platform adventure with a musclebound, sword-wielding hero, a vast menagerie of monsters and intricate, cavernous environments. It takes inspiration from a multitude of non-Mesopotamian sources, including Shadow of the Beast, Zelda and David Joiner's 1987 RPG Fairy Tale Adventure, and is "more free, more open" than the Gilgamesh narrative, with puzzles that pull you deeper into the setting."

Splitgate has been knocking around on PC since May 2019 with a relatively small player base, but the crossplay beta sparked an explosion of popularity (to the tune of half a million downloads) that caused severe server problems. So severe, in fact, that developer 1047 Games was forced to take the beta offline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontier Developments has shared fresh details on its dino-park management sim sequel Jurassic World Evolution 2, talking up the likes of improved dinosaur behaviour, a new scientist role, habitant enhancements, and more in the first of a series of developer videos.
The original Jurassic World Evolution, which released in 2018, was an atmospheric, if ultimately rather shallow take on the classic theme park management sim formula, tasking players with building and maintaining their own dinosaur wonderland by laying out exhibits, tending to visitors needs, and researching new amenities - all while ensure the attractions didn't rampage.
Frontier has already teased a few of the new features coming to Jurassic World Evolution 2 later this year, but its inaugural developer diary video goes a little deeper into some of the elements its hoping will convince punters to delve into their wallets a second time around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Book, the Slavic-folklore-inspired dark RPG adventure from developer Morteshka, now has a release date and will be coming to Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 10th August.
Morteshka - which also developed the similarly striking, Finno-Ugric-inspired The Mooseman - describes Black Book as a "fusion of card-based RPGs and adventure games", playing out against a bleakly beautiful rendition of 19th century rural Eastern Europe.
Players take on the role of Vasilisa - a young witch with the ability to control demons, still reeling from the death of her betrothed - and must set out in search of the legendary Black Book, said to have the power to grant one wish to those that locate its seven seals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a feature that Red Dead Online players have requested almost since the game's launch, but the ability to purchase properties in Red Dead Redemption 2 - aside from the Moonshiner role - has sadly remained a distant dream. While the feature is yet to appear in the game's online mode, modders have stepped in to finally introduce a properties system to the single-player version of the game on PC: so you can now choose your own little house on the prairie. One without Uncle constantly complaining about lumbago.
The Buyable Properties mod was released by modders Bolmin and "Dick Hertz" last week, and provides players with a selection of purchasable hotel rooms and cabins. It's a mod intended for use in the game's epilogue map, and serves as a useful way to spend all your leftover epilogue cash. You can even decorate your house with a variety of interior and exterior upgrades - check out the video below for a demonstration (but spoilers, obviously, for the end of Red Dead Redemption 2's story):
There are three customisable houses to choose from (based in the Heartlands, near Strawberry and near Rhodes), which are marked on the map with a little "house to buy" sign. While you can have a nap in the houses and use some of the items stored in them, their functionality is a little limited at present - although there are apparently plans to add weapon lockers in the next update. If you want something a little fancier, there's always the hotel room option, which this mod allows you to buy permanently.

A number of new job listings have been posted on Respawn's website, with creative director Mohammad Alavi describing the project as a "brand new Respawn single-player adventure". Details on the game remain light, but the postings do note that the project is "in its early stages", while the single-player title is apparently "a designer's dream playground with a freedom to innovate made possible by the unique universe it inhabits."
According to a tweet in April by Respawn developer Steven Kah Hien Wong, the team is building a new IP "from scratch". So before you start asking about Titanfall 3 again, it seems like this is something brand new.

According to the article, the map "features a mix of both tight corridors and more open outdoor areas, leading to a blend of close-quarters combat while still leaving the door open for the likes of Widowmaker to excel from afar".

The speedy new vehicle is the game's most realistic to date, with its model taken from the car configurator software Ferrari used to design the model, and now offers to customers to customise.
Like Fortnite, this software uses Unreal Engine - so not only is this a neat addition for the game, it's also a digital showroom for Epic Games' engine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[January 2020 saw the arrival of Blizzard's highly anticipated Warcraft 3 remake, Reforged, but the celebratory mood quickly soured once fans realised the game failed to deliver much of what was initially promised and took away even more. Now, a report from Bloomberg has shed new light on the behind-the-scenes decision-making that lead to such a disastrous outing for one of Blizzard's most beloved games.
When Reforged was originally announced at BlizzCon 2018, Blizzard sold it as a significant overhaul of its classic real-time strategy game. However, the final version was plagued by bugs, brought broken online play, and was absent of expected features promised in its initial reveal, including improved cutscenes and re-recorded voice overs. It even stripped out elements from the original Warcraft 3, such as leaderboards and clans.
So significant was the negative response to Reforged, Blizzard eventually implemented an on-request refund policy, but the question remained why the company thought it was even remotely acceptable to ship a product in such an shoddy state to begin with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 14's producer and director Naoki Yoshida has told players they "don't need to show so much restraint [they] stop having fun" following his request they make a few concessions to accomodate newcomers while Square continues to addresses server issues caused by a sudden surge in the MMO's popularity.
A record number of players have flocked to the now-decade-old MMO in recent times (Steam saw an all-time peak of 67,019 concurrent players earlier this week), and while that's undoubtedly boon for the long-term health of the game, the sheer number of people wanting to get involved has caused serious server congestion, resulting in lengthy queue times and players being unable to create new characters.
On Tuesday, Yoshida apologised to Final Fantasy 14 players for the ongoing technical woes, assuring them Square is doing everything it can to improve matters. A recently released patch has implemented an automatic logout for AFK players as an "emergency measure to combat congestion", for instance, and login caps have been raised on North American servers.

The original Dead Space launched back in 2008, sending players, in the role of engineer Isaac Clarke, on a terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura, its crew slaughtered by nightmarish creatures known as the necromorphs.
What followed was a deliciously atmospheric third-person horror adventure that saw players embarking on the mother of all fixer-uppers in order to reactive the ship and locate Isaac's missing partner Nicole, engaging lasers to sever innumerable necromorph limbs along the way.

During this evening's EA Play event, game director Chad Grenier discussed Seer's abilities, describing him as similar to Bloodhound and "all about tracking enemies". Aiming down the sights will bring up a heartbeat sensor that will hint at an enemy's location. His tactical, meanwhile, sends drones out of his chest to reveal and track an enemy's location. Seer's ultimate also makes use of his microdrones, using them to create a sphere that senses enemies who move through it.  
For those who are concerned Seer may be a little bit too similar to Bloodhound, Grenier assured players that the new legend is more about stealth, and is able to gather "precise and lingering information".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of tonight's EA Play event, details have leaked on the Battlefield 2042 mode being developed at Ripple Studios that had previously been billed as a "love letter to fans", with Battlefield Portal introducing a powerful level editor that reintroduces classic maps and lets players tinker with them as they please.
The details come via a now-deleted article on Game Rant, which revealed maps from Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 3 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 will feature, alongside the armies and factions from those games and a selection of their arsenal. Players will be able to mix and match elements - so it's possible, it's said, to pit WW2 soldiers against Battlefield 2042's all-new specialists. 
Players will be able to adjust settings, and there's also mention of an in-depth logic editor which allows more granular adjustments.

YouTube creator VickeP first spotted an image in the teaser that looked awfully familiar. He captured the frames of the video that showed the clearest view of the image and stuck it into Photoshop to produce the clearest image. It showed what appears to be huts and powerlines:
He shared the image on reddit, where people noticed the image looked like Battlefield Bad Company 2's map Valparaiso. Vicke then compared the image to gameplay footage of Valpariso and found an exact match. This really is a reflection of just how amazing the collective power of gaming communities can be.

That's according to the Hollywood Reporter, which says the film - to be released under the DC Animated Movie banner - will draw inspiration from Netherrealm's video game titles as well as writer Tom Taylor's Injustice: Gods Among Us: Year One, a comic book prequel to the games.
Its animated action will reportedly unfold on an alternate version of Earth where the Joker has successfully managed to trick Superman into killing Lois Lane, sending the superhero on a rampage of destruction. "This unhinged Superman decides to take control of Earth for its own good," says the Hollywood Reporter, "leading Batman and his allies to attempt to stop him."

        <updated>2021-07-21T18:09:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday saw the beta launch of Amazon's much-delayed MMO New World, and early gameplay reports have been generally positive. Considerably less, positive, however, are the increasing number of posts from players saying that New World has also successfully managed to brick their pricey RTX 3090s graphics cards - an issue Amazon has now gone some way to acknowledging on its official support forum.
Word of New World's potentially hardware-busting abilities first surfaced on the MMO's dedicated sub-reddit. "I just bricked a 3090 in the main menu after setting my graphics quality to medium and hitting save," wrote user greyone78. "Cant believe it. Anyone else had a catastrophic failure like this?".
Multiple responses seem to confirm that, yes, this isn't an isolated issue, and further reports of RTX 3090 malfunctions after playing New World (primarily seeming to impact cards made by EVGA) began to spread to Twitter and beyond, along with speculation the problem may be the result of power spikes and overheating caused by uncapped frame rates in the game's menus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot going on in the world of The Witcher over on Netflix, with the streaming service currently working on three separate projects based on author Andrzej Sapkowski much-loved fantasy novels. First out of the gate, though, is animated movie The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, and it's just received its first proper trailer ahead of its launch on 23rd August.
Nightmare of the Wolf, which was announced at the start of last year, is a prequel to Netflix's main live-action show and focusses on Geralt of Rivia's friend and mentor Vesemir, "long before" the two meet. Indeed, it'll supposedly hurtle back in time to the start of Vesemir's journey as a Witcher, "after the mysterious Deglan claims him through the Law of Surprise".
Netflix offered a brief glimpse of Nightmare of the Wolf earlier this month, but the streaming service has now given Witcher fans a more substantial look at the movie in its first proper trailer, in which a dashing Vesemir flirts, quips, and slays his way to adventure.

Pokémon Go recently passed the $5bn lifetime player spending total, and in 2021 has notched up $731m so far - putting it on track for this year to be its most profitable yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poor old Saitama - not only is he having problems getting people to recognise him for his abilities, but now the servers for his game are set to shut down. 
Bandai Namco announced the news in a tweet, explaining that the multiplayer servers for One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows will go offline on 28th February next year. Offline game modes and "online 1v1 game matches" will still be playable, but that's the end of the fighting game's online multiplayer modes. 
One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows is a 3D arena fighting game based on the One Punch manga and anime. It was released on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 28th February 2020, meaning the online servers will close after exactly two years of life. The game received mixed reviews from players on Steam, and according to SteamDB only ever reached a peak of 586 concurrent players - with only five people playing when I checked this afternoon. I guess the game's title was, er, suitable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news for Fallout 76 building enthusiasts, as Bethesda is bringing custom servers to the game, allowing you to remove CAMP building limits and construct a home wherever your heart desires. If you're paying for a Fallout 1st subscription, that is. 
Fallout Worlds is a new system that's set to arrive in the live game this September, and it's already been rolled out to Fallout 76's public test server. It includes a feature called Custom Worlds, which allows players to tweak world rules such as where CAMPs can be placed, the permitted size of CAMPs, or whether "free building" is allowed. Which basically sounds like a creative mode.
It seems there are some options for PvP players, too: the combat section of the world settings allows players to tweak the difficulty of the world, such as the AP cost of using VATS and Melee. There's also an option to turn on infinite ammo, so you could essentially turn Fallout 76 into your own personal paintball game.

PUBG developer Krafton Inc. has announced it's working on an animated "project" based on the popular battle royale title in conjunction with Adi Shankar, who served as producer and showrunner on Netflix's acclaimed Castlevania adaptation and is the creator of the streaming service's upcoming Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix animated series.
"As a player, I've been crushing the competition in the Battlegrounds since PUBG released in 2017," Shankar wrote in a statement accompanying the announcement. "To me, this animated project represents another step in the evolution of mending the torched bridge between the games industry and Hollywood. I look forward to revealing to everybody what winning a chicken dinner looks like."

Unfolding during a long, hot summer in the mid-90s, Road 96 takes players on an ever-changing hitchhiking adventure across the authoritarian nation of Petria as they attempt to reach the border and start a new life.
Along the way, as Digixart explains, players will "meet incredible characters, and discover their intertwined stories and secrets... But every mile opens up a choice to make. Your decisions will change your adventure, change the people you meet, maybe even change the world."

Or, at least, an enormous trove of documents was leaked to journalists.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to read out there. Amnesty International has a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/">report</a>.

<p>Most interesting is a list of over 50,000 phone numbers that were being spied on by NSO Group&#8217;s software. Why does NSO Group have that list? The obvious answer is that NSO Group provides spyware-as-a-service, and centralizes operations somehow. Nicholas Weaver ...</p>]]></summary>

Lone Echo 2, which was initially announced back in 2018 for a release the following year, picks up after the events of the first game, catapulting protagonists Captain Olivia Rhodes and player-controlled android Echo One (nicknamed "Jack") 400 years into the future, where an abandoned space station holds the key to returning home.
Once again, Ready at Dawn has crafted a moody sci-fi adventure built around zero-gravity traversal and puzzling, with the developer promising "sharp visuals", "complex challenges", and "startling discoveries" as its "emotional" far-future story unfolds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 14's producer and director Naoki Yoshida has addressed the recent server congestion issues blighting the long-running MMO following a "staggering and unexpected" increase in the game's popularity.
"Final Fantasy 14 is currently experiencing a dramatic increase in its player base," Yoshida explained in a post to the game's website. "Recently, we have experienced record user numbers in all regions, with a vast amount of new players beginning their adventures." Indeed, the game successfully smashed its record for concurrent players on Steam earlier this month, reaching 47,542 concurrent players versus the previous record of 41,200 set in June 2019.
Although undoubtedly a boon for the potential longevity of the now-decade-old MMO, this "extreme influx" of new players, as Yoshida puts it, has placed a strain on Final Fantasy 14's servers, with congestion issues causing lengthy queue times and preventing players from creating new characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever felt like Fallout 4 could stand to be a little more, well, Blair Witch? If you fancy stumbling around in the dark while being chased by unseen forces, this might be the mod for you. 
The Wilderness is a chunky Fallout 4 PC mod by El Ha that offers a worldspace "at least as big" as Nuka World, with a bunch of abandoned buildings and a spooky main quest. It's a map that often feels deliberately barren, with the player encouraged to traverse vast distances in search of shelter and supplies. Thanks to the gloomy atmosphere created through a combination of bad weather and a synth-heavy soundtrack, it's easy to get jumpy - and you'll probably find yourself getting creeped out by the landscape as much as the actual jumpscares. Any good horror is about tension, after all. 
On installing the mod, players are presented with a fast travel option north of Sanctuary called "The Wilderness". Travelling there (and walking forwards a little bit) will transport you to The Wilderness itself, a vast wasteland that feels a lot more abandoned than anything in the Commonwealth. You can explore the area in your own time if you fancy, but to start the main quest, you'll need to rummage around in the skeleton near the start area. This will give you your first map and a rather ominous quest message about avoiding "whatever is following you".

We have yet to see any more details about it, but I can't imagine it will be too long before Asobo gives us a glimpse. 
Other requested features include support for multiple screens, DirectX 12 support, replay functionality, and a myriad of other features. The top bugs include incorrect weather and wind readings, game crashes, low-resolution textures and performance issues on some PCs.

My Child Lebensborn was a heart-wrenching game about caring for children born of war. Specifically, children born during World War 2 to Nordic women and German soldiers, and registered in the Nazi Lebensborn programme. It would lead to lives of persecution, abuse and bullying.
The game was released on mobiles in 2018, and won the Game Beyond Entertainment BAFTA in 2019. My Child Lebensborn was released more recently on Steam, and Xbox and PlaySation consoles, in June this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were ever tempted to splash out on lifetime premium membership for Nexus Mods, it's now or never, as the mod platform is removing the option in August. 
Nexus Mods yesterday published a blog post detailing upcoming changes to its billing system. While Nexus Mods is usable for free, premium membership has been an option on the platform since 2007, providing perks such as ad-free browsing and uncapped mod download speeds. The current membership options are split into 1-month, 6-month, 12-month and lifetime plans, but that's set to change on 3rd August. 
"Since we first started offering Premium Membership, our billing system... has been handled by our Invision Board forums software and PayPal," Nexus Mods explained. "To be frank, it's old, archaic, held together by duct tape and glue and was never really intended to be used by a site as big as ours. It's so delicate, we have not been able to update our Premium Membership pricing since 2013 because doing so breaks many different elements of the billing and Premium membership system which we have no control over as the code is not ours.

The leak, which was originally shared with moderators of the /r/Fortniteleaks reddit, appears to come from someone with an intimate knowledge of Fortnite's upcoming plans, and who has leaked detail on multiple seasons in the past.
This new dump of information is the most eye-opening yet, however, with details on some of Fortnite's plans for the rest of this year and possibly next. And with today's new Fortnite patch, v17.20, the first element of the leak has already been spotted in the wild.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has unveiled its previously teased "new Tom Clancy game", revealing it to be XDefiant, a 6v6 free-to-play first-person shooter that, just as leaks suggested, mashes up factions from Ghost Recon, The Division, and Splinter Cell.
In its announcement video, Ubisoft calls XDefiant a "high-octane" arena shooter - playable solo or with friends - that features an "irreverent and rebellious" take on the normally serious Clancy vibe, alongside "realistic gunplay" and personalised classes in the form of factions. 
Each faction is said to offer its own "gameplay and team dynamics", as well as unique passive traits, ultras, and abilities that will "change the moment-to-moment gameplay". Players will be able to mix and match any faction, load out, and weapon - Ubisoft promises an "arsenal of authentic weapons and attachments" - and these can all be switched at will during a respawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised, EA has shared "a little something" related to its its highly anticipated Skate revival after announcing there'd be no news on the latest instalment of its long-dormant skateboarding series during this Thursday's EA Play Live. Skate fans probably shouldn't get too excited though; beyond confirmation that the game is still in the works, there's little to see here.
Announced last June, EA's Skate revival - the fourth game in the series and the first instalment since 2010's Skate 3 - is being worked on by recently formed studio Full Circle, which counts original Skate creators Deran Chung and Cuz Parry among its number.
Given that Full Circle only formally came into existence at the start of this year, work on the new Skate game is unsurprisingly still in its early stages, and Chung said as much in EA's new teaser video. "The truth is it's still early," he explained. "We're still working on it".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn has released a new Stories from the Outlands video, and this one is all about new character Seer: a cursed legend with microdrones and a very cool hat. 
Metamorphosis tells the story of Seer's childhood, explaining that "a bad omen cast a shadow" over his birth, and that his glance "can turn a mountain to dust, a king to a beggar and an ocean to a desert". It's a stunning video, and if you're wondering why the art style looks familiar, that's because the trailer was made in collaboration with animator Robert Valley, who's known for series Love, Death and Robots.    
The Apex Legends website gives a little more detail on the upcoming season, Emergence, and some further snippets of info about Seer. Apparently Seer wields microdrones and has an "artist's eye", which allows him to "spot opportunities that other Legends might miss, and seize them in the most beautiful way he can". A new LMG called the Rampage is also being introduced next season, and it apparently has a "surprising" amount of firepower. The new season will also introduce that much-anticipated Ranked mode for Arenas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go pulled off its big annual Go Fest event at the weekend with enjoyable gameplay and some excellent storytelling flourishes. In-game and in the real world, developer Niantic dropped an array of teases for the game's future, and seemed to nimbly avoid the technical snafus seen in the past when millions of people have logged on to play simultaneously.
Go Fest 2021 was ostensibly about Meloetta, the Mythical Pokémon said to inspire music. The event's first day was spent putting together a band of Pokémon creatures via a Choose Your Own Adventure-style experience which summoned Meloetta to catch at the end.
Day two of the event, on Sunday, was supposedly just about raiding - though Niantic had some other surprises in store. As the first day wrapped up at 6pm local time, a new Mythical creature suddenly appeared on Pokémon Go's loading screen. Then, from 2am, the game's skybox suddenly changed to a galactic background, dotted by mysterious animated portals.

New World is the imminent MMO from Amazon that's based around an Age of Discovery kind of idea. You set sail for a magical island with a powerful magical secret, and try to make a home there. Its key features are territory ownership and housing, and player versus player warfare, in addition to a large fantastical world to battle with and explore.
Verfaillie was referring to the paid quality of life and experience boosters players found evidence of during New World's concluded alpha test. These suggested you might be able to pay for things like rested experience, which can help you level up faster, as well as fast travel.

As explained in a tweet from the official Skate account, new studio Full Circle was only formed back in January, and as such the team is not quite ready to show the game. "It's still early and we are committed to doing this thing right which means it's gonna take some time," the statement said.  
It's not all doom and gloom, however: the statement said the team is "stoked to share a little something with you all tomorrow", so it seems we'll be getting some form of Skate news this week after all. Perhaps we'll finally get a name, or even a teeny tiny teaser.

Bloomberg, which led reporting earlier this year on the upcoming Switch remodel, reported last week that the OLED model was being priced higher to give Nintendo a better profit margin compared to the original Switch. Without naming Bloomberg, Nintendo issued a rare tweet to state "the claim is incorrect".
Nintendo went on to clarify that, beyond Switch OLED, it had "no plans for launching any other model at this time", pouring cold water on the suggestion a further new model might be in the works.

As our pals at Pure Xbox report, that's just the standard edition, too, so depending upon what flavour current-gen Xbox you're running - the X or S - and what edition you'd like to play, it may take up even more than that.

Last week the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced it had shut down what was reported as a cryptocurrency mining farm that contained an incredible 3800 game consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some more speedrunning to watch following this year's Summer Games Done Quick? There's plenty more where that came from, as all-women speedrunning event Flame Fatales is taking place next month. 
The online event is taking place between 15th-21st August, and will be broadcast on the Games Done Quick Twitch channel. There's a real variety of games listed in the lineup, with everything from Warframe to a 15-card run of Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories. There are speedrunning favourites like Celeste and Super Metroid, along with some stranger entries like Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue. Oh, and I'm also glad to see there's also a Fire Emblem: Three Houses run in there. 
The event is being held in support of Malala Fund - a non-profit organisation founded by Malala and Ziauddin Yousafzai in 2013, which works to "champion every girl's right to 12 years of free, safe, quality education". Flame Fatales raised $80k (£63.8k) for Malala Fund last year, and since 2010, Games Done Quick events have raised over $34m (£24.6m) for charity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a year of research, Pokémon Go fans have uncovered a hidden mechanic involved in catching creatures from raid battles.
The research, published today by fan resource The Silph Road, appears to show a secret modifier that boosts the likelihood of catching a raid boss over the course of an encounter.
Simply put, the longer it takes you to catch a boss, the more likely it becomes that your next Premier Ball throw will actually do so. Or, as The Silph Road reports: "You are more likely to catch the raid boss on the 10th throw of the encounter than on your first."

The developer plans to update the High Alert perk to let players hear Dead Silent footsteps. Currently, all High Alert does is make your vision pulse whenever enemies outside of your view see you. By then, of course, it's often too late.
This change to High Alert is important for anyone who plays Warzone - a game in which your ability to hear your enemy coming can make the difference between winning and losing a gunfight.

Redditor Joslatt1 took to the Black Ops Cold War subreddit to report the new support, which other players have subsequently confirmed. There's even a toggle in the menu for 'trigger haptics'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Summer Games Done Quick is all wrapped up, but if you're looking for another exciting speedrun to watch, this world record-breaking blindfolded Super Mario Bros. run seems like a good place to start. 
Speedrunner Crescendo posted a video of the world record run last night, with the timer showing that he managed to beat the game in 11 minutes and 55 seconds. It appears the previous record was held by speedrunner dodai, who achieved a time of 14 minutes and 46 seconds back in 2016. 
This all sounds impressive on paper, but the run itself makes for remarkable viewing: at one point Crescendo has to accurately count down the seconds needed to run a sufficient distance before making a series of perfect jumps. He uses fireballs as an echolocation device, and is able to figure out his surroundings from the noise they make when hitting a wall. He also seems to break bricks to figure out his position.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone's new Season Four Reloaded update is the "first major step" towards increasing the game's average time-to-kill, developer Raven has said.
Raven has talked about making it so it takes longer to kill an enemy in Warzone for some time now.
This morning, a sweeping weapon balance pass, which Raven called "the biggest balance update in the history of Warzone", has seen some weapons heavily nerfed. Guns such as the SCAR, Oden, both AK-47s and the FAL all took a hit, with a particular focus on reducing torso multipliers.

Re:Verse had been given a vague July launch window, after previously being delayed from launching alongside Village back in May.
This latest setback, of at least six months, is the most major yet - though it doesn't come as too much of a surprise. Fan response to Re:Verse's beta was mixed to say the least, and Capcom said today it needed more time "to deliver a smooth gameplay experience".

The 1.18 experimental snapshot allows for some truly spectacular world generation, including realistic-looking mountain peaks and Mines of Moria-like cave structures. 
The only thing which disappointed me was these "cheese", "spaghetti" and "noodle" caves were not actually places you could mine out Italian foodstuffs. (Those names simply reflect the holey or elongated shapes created by the snapshot's cave generation algorithm.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTube is getting several new live-streaming features today, and they may seem rather familiar, as all three of them have been popular features on Twitch for some time. 
As spotted by The Verge, YouTube streamers will now be able to create polls inside their chats, and limit the chats to subscribers-only. Viewers will now also be able to create clips of streams. 
Although the features are hardly the most original, they should give YouTube streamers a little more control over their communities. The subscribers-only chat option is a useful way to moderate discussion and discourage any unwelcome drive-by comments from new viewers. Polls provide another way for viewers to stay engaged with the action - and are a handy tool for streamers looking to find out what their community wants to watch next.

There's no detail yet on what the mix of games will look like, to what extent Netflix will make its own original games, or whether any big franchises you've already heard of will be part of the plans.

Introduction
Are you interested in learning about what SIG Usability does and how you can get involved? Well, you're at the right place. SIG Usability is all about making Kubernetes more accessible to new folks, and its main activity is conducting user research for the community. In this blog, we have summarized our conversation with Gaby Moreno, who walks us through the various aspects of being a part of the SIG and shares some insights about how others can get involved.
Gaby is a co-lead for SIG Usability. She works as a Product Designer at IBM and enjoys working on the user experience of open, hybrid cloud technologies like Kubernetes, OpenShift, Terraform, and Cloud Foundry.

PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners will all be able to play together, with the option to opt-out of mixing PC and console groups if you so choose.
Separately, PS4 and Xbox One console players can also play together, but separate from other platforms. This makes sense, considering last-gen platforms feature 64 instead of 128-player matches.

I can accept that anti-piracy measures are a necessity, and I can equally accept that their sophistication these days may have a certain level of CPU overhead. However, putting out a game that has performance issues because of the DRM crosses a red line - it's something that a developer or publisher absolutely should not do. And yet, I can confirm that Resident Evil Village on PC in its cracked form does run smoother than the flawed official release.
In fact, the compromised code addresses the two key performance issues my colleague Alex Battaglia noted in his Resident Evil Village PC tech review. Firstly, key…]]></summary>

For individual games, there's a new 85 percent revenue split for titles sold after 1st October up until the end of 2023, and up until the first $3m earned. This is similar to both Google and Apple's app store policies, which also take just 15 percent of the revenue cut compared to the industry standard 30 percent, up to a certain threshold.

Well, the team has provided us with another update video to show their progress, and they've now managed to recreate an entire PSone-style boss fight in Unreal Engine 4. 
Developer Lilith Walther, who's an Unreal Engine 4 tech artist and also lead programmer on indie JRPG Witch, shared a video of the boss fight on Twitter. It shows the player taking on Father Gascoigne, and features cutscenes, destructible gravestones and music produced on a Roland SC-88 for "maximum authenticity". You can take a look at the full video below:  
It's seriously impressive work, and personally I think the atmosphere in the "PSone" version feels even spookier than in the original game. The comparison video showing the same cutscene in Bloodborne and the demake is also well worth a watch:

This isn't just any old 3D model seen from a distance, however - the mod team is trying to make "one of the most detailed and accurate free 3D recreations of the Titanic ever made". Players will be able to explore the ship in freeroam mode, and the work done so far really does look stunning:
On top of all that, the mod even comes with its own storyline. It promises fully voice-acted missions, complete with cutscenes and a new soundtrack.

Yes, even the incredibly difficult to obtain Dark Matter camos for these weapons were unlocked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG Mobile really has been through the wringer in India: its popularity in the country led to concerns that children were spending too long playing the game, and several Indian cities placed bans on the game in 2019 after blaming it for promoting violent behaviour. Then, in 2020, PUBG Mobile was banned across the entire country following increased tensions between China and India. As the game was published by Chinese company Tencent, PUBG Mobile was included in the list of 118 apps banned in India over security concerns. 
But it seems PUBG Corp wasn't quite ready to give up, and a new version of the game is already seeing massive success. 
Battlegrounds Mobile India is the new (but still not particularly catchy) name of PUBG Mobile in India, and it's off to a roaring start. The game launched on 2nd July, and now has 34 million registered players, 16m daily active users, and a peak concurrent player count of 2.4 million. And apparently it's not even on the Apple App Store yet (via Times of India).

In a post on the Frontier forum, chief David Braben said the studio accepts the "frustration" players have had with the Odyssey expansion since it came out in May.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched, quickly accruing a 'Mostly Negative' rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.

Square Enix's role-playing adventure, which launched on PC in December 2015, received an update to fix an issue with Lightning's voice not being played in some scenes, according to a note on Steam.
How random! Or is it? As many fans have already speculated, this update may be more about tidying up the game ahead of a launch into Xbox Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn has been battling hackers in its online games for some time, but the situation escalated recently when hackers blocked players from accessing Apex Legends in order to complain about hacking in Titanfall. And unfortunately it seems the saga is having an impact on Respawn's development plans, with work on at least one highly-anticipated feature for Apex Legends, cross-progression, slowed by the recent spate of attacks.  
Earlier this week Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier responded to a question about cross-progression on Twitter, explaining that "recent hacks on Apex and TF have slowed down the progress of it". He added that the studio needed to "context switch to solving live game issues". 
Although cross-platform play was implemented in Apex Legends last year, players have so far been unable to transfer progress between accounts on different platforms (aside from moving between Steam and Origin). It's a feature the team seems eager to introduce, with Grenier explaining via Reddit that implementing it will be "much harder post-launch since users may have multiple accounts to merge or use". Given the ongoing problems with hacking in Apex Legends and the Titanfall games, it sounds like it could be a little while longer before we see this feature implemented.

In a series of tweets this morning, Kojima compared the typical use of the term Director's Cut in the movie business, and what had happened here. 
Kojima's reasoning is the PlayStation 5 version's new features were all developed after the original Death Stranding released, rather than it being a new version of the game assembled from cut content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a week of weird and wonderful speedruns, this year's Summer Games Done Quick event came to an end on Sunday - with a total of $2.8m (£2m) raised for charity. 
This year the online speedrunning event was raising money for Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières), a charity that provides medical assistance to those affected by conflict, disasters, epidemics or exclusion from healthcare. The donations from the latest event mean that Games Done Quick has now raised over $34m (£24.5m) for charity in total. 
As you may have noticed from Twitter, one of the highlights of this year's Summer Games Done Quick was a GeoGuessr speedrun, in which player Havrd managed to figure out his locations with remarkable accuracy. The Pokémon Black and White any percentage race between PulseEffects and Swiftalu, meanwhile, came down to the last five seconds. You can check out both of these highly entertaining speed runs below - or check out the full catalogue of runs on GDQ's YouTube channel.

Heritage Auctions, which handled the sale, has shifted numerous rare games in the past, but nothing with a price close to this.
Still, interest in rare or vintage video games is on the rise. The previous record was set only last week, for an unopened NES copy of the original Legend of Zelda. That went for $878k (£633k).

As part of tonight's WitcherCon, a livestream collaboration between CD Projekt and Netflix, the streaming service has announced that the long-awaited second season of its live-action Witcher TV series will arrive on 17th December this year.
That means fans will have been waiting almost exactly two years by the time Season 2 arrives (its predecessor debuted in December 2019), with the long gap between seasons largely the result of coronavirus-related filming delays. With filming wrapped and post-production now well underway, though, Netflix is finally ready to talk specifics and has confirmed Season 2 will once again consist of eight episodes, all of which have now had their official names revealed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's animated Witcher movie, Nightmare of the Wolf, will officially arrive on 23rd August, and there's a first look at its action in a new teaser trailer to celebrate the news.
Announced back at the start of last year, Nightmare of the Wolf focusses on Geralt of Rivia's friend and mentor Vesemir, and is set "long before" the two meet. In fact, previous word from Netflix suggests it'll wind the action all the way back to the start of Vesemir's journey as a Witcher, "after the mysterious Deglan claims him through the Law of Surprise".
And if that's left you sufficiently intrigued, you can see Netflix's first teaser trailer for Nightmare of the Wolf below. Animation is being handled by Studio Mir - the team behind Legend of Korra - while Lauren S. Hissrich and Beau DeMayo, respectively showrunner and writer on the main live-action Witcher series, are both involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video game collector has come across what is believed to be evidence of the "SNK Millennium" console - 20 years after it was rumoured to be in the works.
Anthony Bacon, from Chicago (who we've featured multiple times on Eurogamer before), was sent a mystery SNK motherboard earlier this year and asked to investigate by its owner.
This board had a long journey to Bacon's desk. His friend, Brian Hargrove, bought a lot of SNK motherboards from Yahoo Auctions Japan 15 years ago, not having any idea what they were. He sold the board in question to a friend of his called Max, who five months ago contacted Bacon to ask if he could work out what it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snowman and Land & Sea has announced that Alto's Odyssey, the endless sand-surfing game from 2018, is getting a special edition. Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City comes to Apple Arcade on 16th July.
The Lost City is a sort of revisiting of the original game, allowing players to "venture deeper into the endless desert to uncover its best-kept secret." The game adds a new biome - the Lost city - and expands upon the original design with new secrets and challenges. The idea is to give returning players something fresh to tease at, while allowing new players to see what the game's all about in the first place.
The teaser trailer promises lavish mystery and paper lanterns - always a lovely mix. If you have played the original game, your save data will carry across too, which is pretty great. Can't wait for this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane Studios, the developer behind the likes of Dishonored and Prey, has been teasing Deathloop for quite some time now, and the wonderfully stylish recursive stealth shooter has looked captivating at every turn. And the tantalising glimpses continued tonight with nine new minutes of gameplay footage, as shown during Sony's latest PlayStation State of Play.
First, the basic premise for those unfamiliar; in Deathloop, players take on the role of Colt, an assassin who finds himself trapped in an endless time loop on the mysterious Blackreef island. In order to escape, he'll need to take out eight targets known as the Visionaries before the day ends - but if he fails (or dies) time rewinds and he'll need to start over.
All isn't lost, however; by exploring further in each successive loop, players can gain valuable clues they'll be able to use next time around to locate and eliminate their targets before the day ends - and Arkane's latest gameplay footage focusses on an attempt to bring down the Visionary known as Aleksis "The Wolf" Dorsey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Megagon Industries' wonderfully serene (and deliciously infuriating) mountain bike adventure Lonely Mountains: Downhill is a brilliant thing, but given that it's also a year and a half old now, fans may be hoping for a bit of a shake-up. And what do you know? Megagon's newest update is here to do just that, wafting away the threat of encroaching staleness with a range of new Daily Ride challenge modifiers.
Daily Rides, if you've not yet checked them out, are daily cross-platform leaderboards that challenge players to do their best in a randomly selected trial, with participants able to unlock various cosmetic rewards, refreshed each season, along the way. Today's update marks the start of Lonely Mountains' seventh season, Summer Strolls, and introduces those aforementioned modifiers to freshen things up for players.
Today's Daily Ride, for instance, rolls out the new Changed Checkpoints modifier - which, as its name suggests, changes and adds new checkpoints to the trail - but future modifiers for the season have also been revealed (and you can see a few of them in the trailer below).

Additionally, David Nowlin and Dave Boat, who've voiced Sam and Max previously in a number of Telltale titles, are reprising their roles as the dubious dog and bunny duo.

        <updated>2021-07-08T01:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Souls 3 has just received a new lease of life on Xbox Series consoles, thanks to the transformative powers of FPS Boost. The From Software classic now targets 60 frames per second on the new wave of Microsoft consoles, replacing the somewhat wobbly 30fps of the Xbox One rendition of the game. We had early access to the FPS Boosted rendition of the game and it certainly does the job, delivering nigh-on flawless performance on Xbox Series consoles.
This is a much-requested upgrade for Xbox Series X and S owners, bringing the game closer into line with its performance profile on PS5. Dark Souls 3 released on last-gen systems in 2016 with a firm 30fps cap, but many months later, a PlayStation 4 Pro patch removed the limit, offering frame-rates up to 60fps. Unfortunately, the value of the upgrade was questionable at the time, owing to a highly variable level of performance on Sony's enhanced machine. However, in the long run, it worked out - PlayStation 5's backwards compatibility horsepower locks the game to 1080p60.
Unfortunately, From Software never went back to the Xbox One version of Dark Souls 3 to add One X support, meaning that 900p30 has been the upper limit of performance on Xbox consoles since the game's original launch. Not only that, in common with From's other 30fps console offerings, inconsistent frame-pacing added a certain degree of judder to the game, something baked into the engine that extra back-compat horsepower could not address. Today's FPS Boost upgrade overrides the frame-rate cap to give Xbox Series X and S the same, smooth experience 60fps as PS5, with no judder, hitches or stuttering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long old wait, but console fans of 11 Bit Studios' celebrated post-apocalyptic city builder Frostpunk will finally be able to get their hands on Xbox and Playstation versions of the game's three expansions from Wednesday, 26th June. 
Frostpunk launched on consoles toward the end of 2019, introducing its narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder - in which players must overcome gruelling conditions to keep their fledgling community alive in a desolate sub-zero world - to a legion of new fans.
Since then, three distinctive expansions have released on PC, building upon Frostpunk's punishing but wonderfully compelling core in interesting new ways, and it's these that will finally debut on consoles later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch owners with a taste for cracking yarns, urban fantasy, and a smattering of demonic possession have a bit of a treat in store; developer Wadjet Eye's superb point-and-click adventure Unavowed is available on Nintendo's platform from today.
Unavowed - which is the work of Dave Gilbert, the designer behind Wadjet Eye's renowned Blackwell series - was enormously well-received when it released on PC back in 2018, receiving much acclaim for its ambitious structure and wonderfully compelling storyline.
It sees players taking on the role of a (somewhat definable) character who's spent the last year terrorising New York City in a demonically possessed frenzy - and who now, after intervention from a crack team of supernatural specialists, finds themselves in the employ of an ancient, evil-battling secret society and ready to put their recent mistakes right.

Warzone Tracker was one of a number of overlay apps on the Overwolf network that were disabled earlier this year following an update to the battle royale.
This update, issued in response to an Activision API terms of service breach by a separate app on the Overwolf framework, had the knock-on effect of blocking Overwolf entirely, preventing its use while the PC version of Warzone was in use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nacon has delayed the release of Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong. Originally scheduled to arrive this year, the narrative RPG is now due to launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and PC in February 2022.
Swansong, which was announced back in 2019, is the work of Big Bad Wolf, the studio behind episodic adventure game The Council, and places players into the shoes of three different vampires, each belonging to a different clan within the vampire sect of The Camarilla.
"Weaving between their intertwined tales," Nacon explained at the time of Swansong's reveal, "the player has to confront the different points of view of his characters to unravel fact from fiction. With whispers of conspiracy, murder and power struggles, the player must protect his clan, discover the truth and above all enforce the Masquerade, the vampire law designed to conceal the existence of creatures of the night from humans."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiders - the French studio behind the scrappy but lovable RPG likes of GreedFall and The Technomacer - has shared first gameplay footage of its offbeat new action-RPG, Steelrising.
Steelrising, if you're unfamiliar, features a deliciously high-concept premise, unfolding in a heavily reimagined version of 18th century Paris, where players are cast as Aegis, one of Marie Antoinette's automaton bodyguards, and charged with tracking down their maker in a bid to stop Louis XVI's army of rogue robots.
Steelrising got its big reveal last summer, when Spiders shared a wonderfully atmospheric teaser trailer offering a glimpse of Paris' battle-ravaged streets and glorious automaton creations. And now, following a second cinematic trailer in June, the developer has provided a first look at Steelrising's gameplay, predominantly focussing on its flashy third-person combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been quite some time since iconic 80s action-movie antihero RoboCop had a video game to call his own (he last appeared on PC and consoles over 18 years ago, re-emerging with a free-to-play mobile offering in 2014), but it's been revealed everybody's favourite cyborg security professional will be making a long-awaited gaming comeback in RoboCop: Rogue City.
RoboCop: Rogue City, which is set for release on PC and currently unannounced consoles some time in 2023, is the work of developer Teyon (the studio responsible for the critically savaged Terminator: Resistance and Rambo: The Video Game), and will feature an "original story" based on the events of the first three RoboCop films.
Beyond the fact that players will take on the role of  RoboCop himself - "Become the iconic hero whose [sic] part man, part machine, all cop as you attempt to bring justice to the dangerous, crime-ridden streets of Old Detroit in RoboCop: Rogue City," teases publisher Nacon in its press release - specifics are currently a little scarce.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known for a while that Kylotonn Racing is working on an all-new Test Drive Unlimited, and now we finally know where it'll be set, with Hong Kong set to be the backdrop for the open world racer. 
The location was revealed in today's Nacon Connect with another CGI trailer which teased some further details including a doubling down on the bling-obsessed lifestyle elements. We also got to see what the backdrop of Hong Kong will offer, from its muddy shores to its hyper-colourful streets through to its glorious hills. 
Hong Kong has been a popular destination for previous video games, of course, from Shenmue 2 to the beloved Sleeping Dogs. It follows on from Test Drive Unlimited's Oahu setting, while its sequel headed to Ibiza (and missed out on the opportunity for a Wayne Lineker cameo - for shame).

The Witcher: Blood Origin is a new six-part series set 1,200 years before Netflix's Henry-Cavill-starring main Witcher show and will chart the creation of the prototype Witcher, as well as the events leading to the "pivotal" Conjunction of the Spheres - in which a collision of different realms brought monsters into the world. 
Lauren S. Hissrich, showrunner on Netflix's mainline Witcher series, will executive produce Blood Origin, and Declan de Barra - who penned The Witcher Season 1's "Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials" episode - will serve as writer and showrunner on the prequel.

There's a new dock, too, with a wired LAN port.  White and neon red/blue colours will be available. Officially, it's called the Nintendo Switch (OLED model) console. In the US it costs $350. In the UK, we're yet to see local pricing.
We and others had expected Nintendo to push the button (flip the Switch?) and reveal its new model before E3. Nintendo really doesn't like leaks! Anyway, on time or not, here we are:

        <updated>2021-07-05T17:50:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, has announced a second paid expansion, titled Ideology, which'll be arriving in the next few weeks alongside a substantial free content update for all players.
Following on from last year's Royalty DLC, Ideology aims to enhance RimWorld's celebrated core by providing the tools needed to fashion a specific belief system for your colony. "You can play as tree-worshipping cannibals who carve skulls into every piece of furniture," explains developer Tynan Sylvester on Steam, "or blind tunnelers who shun the light, or transhumanists obsessed with perfecting the human form using exotic technology. Or be nudists, or drug-stupor mystics, or piratical raiders, or charity-focused givers, or pain-loving animal sacrificers, or dance-party techno ravers, or rustic ranching cowboys, or many many more."
Sylvester says it'll be possible to mix and match different core elements of a colony's belief system in Ideology, and that customisation can be taken even further if desired, with the expansion enabling players to individually adjust preferences in the following categories: precept, ritual, special social role, venerated animal and weapon, culture and style, unique building, tattoo, clothing, background narrative, god, and, perhaps most importantly of all, beard (more on those shortly!).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series will not release anytime soon, according to reports. 
Grand Theft Auto 6 is still at least three or four years away, according to Battlefield insider Tom Henderson, who last week suggested GTA6 would not see a release until at least 2024 or 2025. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has now said he has heard similar.
The long wait, Henderson said, was due to a push within developer Rockstar to improve staff welfare and avoid the levels of crunch which have plagued the company over past releases. It is also, Henderson continued, because Rockstar wants to launch GTA6 at a time when the install base for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has grown considerably.

Might & Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for the game - leaving some unable to access significant portions of its single-player content and its DLC.
And, as Emma reported last month, despite these issues, the game and its DLC were left on sale. No more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new mod for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition has fixed the series' infamous save bug involving Conrad Verner - the infamous Shepard fan who loves to bug you.
The glitch caused Mass Effect 2 to incorrectly remember how you had treated Verner in Mass Effect 1, if you were nice to him. Catching up with Verner a second time, he would always react like you had put a gun in his face to get him to desist from acting like a trained N7 recruit for his own good. 
BioWare likely left this bug unpatched in the Legendary Edition as it later retconned Verner's glitched response in Mass Effect 3, where Verner apologises if he had misremembered Shepard's earlier actions.

While not formally revealed by the developer, the information has seemingly been leaked by a trademark filing with Justia Trademarks. The new logo - which looks in keeping with past ones from the anthology - was filed on 1st July, 2021.
As described by the trademark organisation itself, The mark consists of the word "THE on top of the words DARK PICTURES, stacked on top of the words THE DEVIL IN ME".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead By Daylight has hit a new record of over 100,000 concurrent players on PC during its fifth anniversary celebrations.
The new record - which coincided with a 40 per cent off Steam sale and the recent release of a bunch of Resident Evil-themed goodies, including new skins and a new killer - saw 105,093 players jump on Steam at the same time, according to SteamDB.
The milestone also comes at the same time the asymmetric horror game, developed by Behaviour Interactive, is running an time-limited event from now until 15th July, during which there's a load of new content up for grabs, including anniversary crowns, community challenges, and enough Iridescent Shards for all players to purchase an "entire original character" of their choice.

        <updated>2021-07-04T09:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sealed, rare variant of Nintendo's 1987 classic The Legend of Zelda is currently for sale via auction. At the time of writing, with five days left to go on the auction, the lot has a current bid of $110,000 (£72,300).
This lot, called a "NES R" variant, is particularly significant because this version was "only produced for a few months in late 1987". Rev-A replaced it in early 1988.
The only version considered more valuable than this one is a "NES TM", and there's reportedly only one sealed copy in existence "and there is no telling whether or not that copy will ever come to market". Therefore, this cartridge is likely "the earliest sealed copy one could realistically hope to obtain" and sits at a grading - or wata rating - of 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios has published seven minutes of gameplay of its System Shock remake.
The System Shock video, below, includes plenty of skulking about in the Research level of Citadel Station.
I think it looks pretty impressive - the visuals are appropriately atmospheric, with plenty of sparky visual effects. There's a sense of foreboding, which System Shock should have. We see enemies who lurch towards the player once they're disturbed. The video ends with a quite terrifying fight against a large robot who takes an age to go down.

The headline announcement is the End of Dragons expansion has been delayed from late 2021 to early 2022. In a post on the Guild Wars 2 website, ArenaNet director John Taylor explained the delay:
"As expansion development has progressed and the real-world challenges of the past year and a half have changed the way we live and work, it's become clear that we need a little more time to deliver our creative vision for Cantha. As a result, we're delaying the release of Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons from late 2021 to early 2022.

In a statement published to Twitter, Faze said it had "removed" Frazier Kay from its clan, and suspended Jarvis Khattri, Nikan Nadim and Teeqo until further notice.
These influencers, each with millions of YouTube subscribers and social media followers, were heavily criticised for promoting a cryptocurrency token called Save the Kids whose value plummeted soon after it launched.

The Dungeons & Dragons action role-playing game launched on 22nd June and was met with a mixed reception, so there are a lot of eyeballs on this first patch to see if it remedies some of the game's more immediate issues.
Unfortunately, developer Tuque Games' patch notes for Dark Alliance v1.16 are so vague, players are struggling to work out what the update actually does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom Eternal will no longer receive its previously announced PvP-focussed Invasions mode, with id Software having made the decision to pivot development toward a new single-player horde mode instead, due to coronavirus-related development challenges.
Invasions Mode, announced back at QuakeCon 2018, was intended to deliver a vaguely Dark-Souls-esque multiplayer spin on Doom Eternal's single-player campaign, enabling other humans to manifest as demons throughout the story and do battle with the host player for some added challenge.
Well over 12 months after Doom Eternal's March 2020 launch, however, Invasions Mode is still yet to materialise, leaving fans to ponder its fate. And now, in a newly released statement, id Software executive producer Marty Stratton has provided an answer, confirming Invasions Mode is officially dead due to the impact "the unforeseen consequences of the pandemic and remote working" have had on development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, the second game in Capcom's RPG spin-off series, comes to Switch and PC next Friday, 9th July, and, much like its mainline sibling, will enjoy a healthy dose of post-launch support. And now, with its arrival in sight, Capcom has shared a roadmap outlining those post-release content plans.
One week after Monster Hunter Stories 2's launch, Capcom will deploy its first (and previously detailed) post-launch update, introducing introducing Monster Hunter Rise's dog-like Palamute companion as a rideable Monstie.
That'll be followed by a second update on 5th August introducing Hellblade Glavenus and Boltreaver Astalos as new Monsties, alongside a new co-op quest - featuring the gilded Elder Dragon Kulve Taroth - that Monster Riders can tackle together. Capcom notes that while the Elder Dragon won't be rideable, materials gained from the quest can be used to craft "powerful" new equipment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nexus Mods has announced that mod authors will soon be unable to delete mod files from the website, a change being made ahead of the introduction of its new collections system. 
The news was announced via a blog post, where the company explained that the change was necessary for the implementation of its collections system. From now on, mod files will be archived instead of deleted, which will make them "inaccessible unless directly requested eg. via the API."
"It is our core belief that making modding easier is a noble goal, so more people can enjoy our joint hobby," Nexus Mods said. "We are convinced that our collections system, a project we have spent almost two years and many work-hours on, is the way to achieve this goal."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humble Bundle faced criticism earlier this year when it tried to remove charity sliders from its bundle pages, a decision that would have severely limited the amount players could donate to charity for their purchases. Following significant backlash, Humble Bundle decided to reverse this decision and reinstate the sliders - but it's once again placing limits on how much can be donated to charity. 
In a blog post, Humble Bundle announced it will be rolling out a "new iteration" of sliders in mid-July. "While splits on each bundle will vary, on average there will be a minimum amount for Humble Bundle between 15-30 percent," the post said. This means users will no longer be able to donate the entire amount to charity, although the company said there will continue to be some "100 percent to charity bundles". 
The company explained that the "PC storefront landscape has changed significantly" since the bundles began in 2010, and it had to "continue to evolve with it to stay on mission.

CD Projekt first announced Monster Slayer in August last year, and said that its mobile studio Spokko was on development duties. It promised "rich, story-driven quests" and first-person monster battles impacted by your local time of day and weather. So, rain.

This leaves development work to continue (and Xbox boss Phil Spencer to continue displaying a Kojima Productions figurine on his shelf) in the meantime.

After an understandable hiatus, Nintendo has introduced a new similarly-themed series simply called 'Ask the Developer', with the first installment focussing on the recently released Game Builder Garage. It's a gentle, informative and enlightening read, even if it's short on any major revelations (although it's opened my eyes to the stylish lab coats all Nintendo developers seem to wear at the moment). 
The interview comes as Game Builder Garage gets a free demo on Nintendo Switch, with the first of its seven lessons now available to download from the eShop.

The 1.1.0 update, which went live yesterday, introduces the all-new Mario Cup, and upon its completion you're given access to new environments and gates to use in your course creations. There's also new kart elements, with 'Super Yoshi' and 'Yoshi Horn' up for grabs. 
Mario Kart Live Home Circuit was the work of Velan Studios, who've gone on to find further success with this year's Knockout City. Home Circuit wasn't without its limitations, but it was still a fascinating and frequently charming thing.  "A neatly crafted gizmo, and a fresh reminder that Nintendo remains a toymaker at heart," we wrote in our Mario Kart Live Home Circuit review.

Asobo offered a look the huge performance improvements coming to Microsoft Flight Simulator on PC during its latest developer livestream, with CEO Sebastian Wloch explaining the team has rewritten "a lot of the parts of the engine...in order to get the maximum performance out of the sim", as part of its work on the upcoming console version.
To illustrate just how effective Asobo's engine tweaks have been, Wloch demoed a before-and-after gameplay video featuring a flyover of Manhattan, captured from a PC equipped with an i7-9700K CPU and Nvidia 2060 Super graphics card - and running Flight Simulator at Ultra settings in 4K with a 40% render scale (jump to the 8-minute mark below to see the footage).

The Sims 4: Cottage Living, which arrives on 22nd July, is the tenth full-scale Expansion Pack (and 42nd bit of paid DLC) to launch for life sim since its release in 2014, and - as its name very much implies - is all about cosy cottages and rustic charm.
Unsurprisingly, top of the list of features coming in Cottage Living is the ability to settle down in a charmingly rustic new abode. Here, players can befriend the likes of wild rabbits, foxes, and birds, while also raising their own animals - including llamas, chickens, and cows for wool, eggs, and milk respectively - in order to start their journey to self-sufficiency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having spent some time percolating in the rumour pool (and occasionally leaking onto various ratings boards around the world), developer Sucker Punch's "director's cut" of its acclaimed open-world stealth-action game Ghost of Tsushima is now official, and coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 20th August.
Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, as the new edition is formally known, features all the content from the original release, alongside a new chapter in protagonist Jin's story, which will see him travel to Tsushima's neighbouring island of Iki.
"In this new story," Sucker Punch explains on the PlayStation Blog, "Jin travels to the island to investigate rumours of a Mongol presence. But soon, he finds himself caught up in events with deeply personal stakes that will force him to relive some traumatic moments from his past."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that Team Fortress 2 has a bit of a bot problem, but the game also has a community that really enjoys mid-match shenanigans - and the two combined today in one of the funniest posts about TF2 bots I've seen so far. 
Reddit user 2Noel posted footage of an Attack/Defend match in which Blu team was pitted against a bunch of bots - normally not great news for those wanting to keep their heads on their shoulders. Yet the team decided to try a different tactic to just charging into battle, instead choosing to conga their way out of spawn and onto the control points. And surprisingly, it worked. Stay tuned for the satisfying bot slaughter at the end of the match:  
The question you're probably asking right now is: why didn't the bots shoot the Blu team members? The answer, it seems, is that the bots are programmed to avoid shooting players who are using taunts and emotes. If you look closely at the video, you'll notice that players not engaged in the conga line (such as poor old atomdotdat) are instantly sniped by the bots, while the dancers remain unharmed.

But it is those horns which are causing a problem for some fans, who have said the mischievous god's headpiece simply blocks too much of their view.
I've played a few games now as Loki and haven't seen as much of an issue as the images being shared on reddit, such as the one below. I think this is probably angled to make the problem look as bad as possible, although yes, Loki's enormous helmet is certainly quite distracting.

Here&#8217;s one more contribution to that issue: a <a href="https://static.rusi.org/247-op-cyber-insurance-v2.pdf">research paper</a> that the insurance industry is hurting more than it&#8217;s helping.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, the most pressing challenge currently facing the industry is ransomware. Although it is a societal problem, cyber insurers have received considerable criticism for facilitating ransom payments to cybercriminals. These add fuel to the fire by incentivising cybercriminals&#8217; engagement in ransomware operations and enabling existing operators to invest in and expand their capabilities. Growing losses from ransomware attacks have also emphasised that the current reality is not sustainable for insurers either...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Iron Gate recently made a change to enemy AI that made monsters much more aggressive towards buildings, and players started to complain the monsters had become a bit too rowdy. Enemies were seen running past players to destroy their buildings instead, while some monsters became so confused about what they should be attacking that they essentially froze in place. I checked the patch out for myself and discovered local greydwarfs had stripped our village walls of decorations, while a run-in with a troll ended in disaster when it became a bit too interested in my friend's treehouse:
In any case, it seems Iron Gate noticed the AI change was causing a fair bit of chaos, and the AI has been tweaked once again to solve the problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week we heard that several fan-made GoldenEye levels in Far Cry 5 had been pulled by Ubisoft following a copyright claim, but it seems the author has now reuploaded the levels under a new name - which will hopefully be enough to ensure the levels stay up in future. 
After confirming the levels had been pulled, creator Krollywood said a few days ago he intended to "change some details like names and re-upload them as soon as possible," and it seems that's now happened. Krollywood confirmed in a Reddit comment that the levels have been reuploaded to Far Cry 5's arcade mode under the name "Golden Cry". To find them on PS4 you'll need to search for the creator name "Perfect-Dark1982", and on PC the creator name is "Graslu00".
Krollywood spent two and a half years recreating the 18 GoldenEye 007 levels in Far Cry 5's level editor, and you can hear a little about how he did it in the video below:

In recent months players have reported increased DDoS attacks on Ranked games, with Respawn pledging to take "huge steps" to fix the problem. And we now have another update on what the studio is doing to combat cheaters, with Respawn hiring more people and developing new tools to keep them at bay. 
As explained on Twitter, Respawn said it's hiring "more people to focus on manual bans", and is also investigating new ways to catch and remove cheaters from games - presumably through automated tools. Respawn also specifically addressed the DDoS problem, saying it was "developing more tools to automatically detect and stop DDoS attacks". 
"Playing against cheaters sucks," said Respawn's Twitter account. "We'll keep you updated as we ship the above changes and pursue new ones."

        <link href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-30-pubgs-new-taego-map-has-a-gulag-style-second-chance-system"/>
        <updated>2021-06-30T14:53:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG's much-teased Taego map has finally arrived on PC test servers, bringing with it some new features including self-revives and a special "second chance" mechanic. Well... new to PUBG, at least. 
The freshly-released patch notes explain that Taego is an 8x8 map set in 1980s South Korea, with landscapes "ranging from wide-open reed fields to the close quarters of Hosan Prison". It's also got some wildlife, with flocks of birds that react to player movement and gunfire, so take your binoculars with you - those birds might just help you track down another squad. If you stream yourself doing that, you're a twitcher in two senses of the word. 
The map also has a new feature called Comeback BR, which gives players who die before the first Blue Zone the ability to get themselves back into the game. All you have to do is stay alive in a separate "Comeback Arena" for a certain amount of time. It sounds pretty similar to Call of Duty: Warzone's Gulag, except it's more like another mini battle royale rather than a one-on-one battle to the death. Players who survive are reintroduced to the main game in phase three of the match, complete with all their items and gear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember those Call of Duty: Modern Warfare maps that were surprise-added (and then removed) earlier this year? Well, they're back once again, and hopefully they're going to stick around a bit longer this time. 
The returning multiplayer maps are Al-Raab Airbase (6v6) and Drainage (Gunfight), with the former being reintroduced as a 24/7 playlist, and the latter now available in the Gunfight and Gunfight - Snipers Only playlists. 
The maps were originally added to the game in an update back in March, a move that surprised players given Activision was expected to have switched focus to supporting Black Ops Cold War and Warzone. Al-Raab Airbase and Drainage were briefly available to play in private matches, but in April Activision removed the two maps, later explaining they needed more time in the oven. Anyway, they have now returned, and should help mix things up for those still playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever felt bad about keeping all your old files in a mess, here's something to make you feel better, as a much sought-after early version of Minecraft has finally been found - thanks to one player who made backups of her old laptop. Oh, and I guess this also means that tweeting everything is useful after all. 
As spotted by Kotaku, Twitter user @lunasorcery explained in a thread that she'd helped a group of Minecraft historians find a long-lost early version of the game. Build Alpha 1.1.1 was apparently a "long-running meme" and "holy grail" for Minecraft archivist group Omniarchive, as the historians had never been able to track the elusive build down. It was an exceedingly rare version of the game that was released on 18th September 2010, and was only available for three hours and 25 minutes due to a bug that would turn the player's screen grey. 
Luckily, someone spotted a 2010 tweet by Luna in which she discussed the Minecraft update, and messaged her to ask if she had a copy of the build. She initially ignored the message, thinking there was "no chance in hell" that she would still have a copy, but last Friday another person contacted her about the tweet - and this prompted her to take a closer look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Valheim developer Iron Gate rolled out a patch that was intended to provide players with an extra level of challenge: enemies were tweaked to be more aggressive towards structures, meaning players would have to be more proactive about defending their homes. But some players feel Iron Gate went overboard with these changes, highlighting that the patch has resulted in some strange enemy behaviour - along with the wanton destruction of property. 
Over on the Valheim subreddit, players have argued that Valheim's monsters are now too eager to attack buildings, sometimes opting to destroy structures even when standing directly next to the player. This has led to some "immersion-shattering" enemy behaviour, with monsters looking uncertain about who they should be attacking. Some players, meanwhile, are simply exasperated at the amount of damage now being caused in monster raids. 
"Earlier today I had a troll invasion and I had three trolls attacking my base non-stop," said Reddit user Squatch11. "I literally couldn't get them to attack me. Half of my base was destroyed before I managed to kill them."

The fan-created source code for both games was made available on GitHub, offering a raft of eye-catching improvements over the original games officially available to play today on PC. (For more, check out our feature on how re3 came to be.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mass Effect Legendary Edition has certainly done the trick: it's rekindled a love of BioWare's original trilogy years after the games came out. But it's not just Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3 that are being judged once again. Fans are reappraising Mass Effect Andromeda, too.
2017's Mass Effect Andromeda endured a torrid time upon release, with clips of dialogue scenes descending into meme status. There were other areas of the game that came under fire, including its limited character creator, bugs and animation quirks.
Beyond that, though, Andromeda's missions, storyline and characters failed to set the world on fire. Without Commander Shepard, the Normandy and the original trilogy's cast of much-loved characters, Andromeda set out for a new galaxy, a new premise and new party members. I think it's fair to say it didn't stick the landing. Some thought the game was just okay, others considered it outright awful. Either way, Andromeda flopped and BioWare soon moved on, leaving it sequel-less.
