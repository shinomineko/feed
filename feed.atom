        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As 2021 drew to a close, the long-running Yogcast Jingle Jam charity bundle event returned for its latest instalment, this time taking the form of a truly spectacular 56-game bundle - and organisers have now confirmed the endeavour raised a total of £3.3m for good causes.
2021's bundle was impressive enough from a content perspective, gathering up the likes Eurogamer's Essential-rated Widermyth, linguistics adventure Heaven's Vault, Viking strategy Northguard, top-down action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter, plus Surviving Mars, Murder by Numbers, 20XX, and a load more. It was absolutely unmissable from a value perspective, however, amounting to around £650 worth of games for anyone that donated £35 or more.

Jones' affinity with Full Throttle - developer LucasArt's 1995 point-and-click biker gang classic, written by the legendary Tim Schafer - is, of course, pretty well-known by this point. "It blew my mind! I LOVED that game," he wrote in a tweet at the start of last year, "I mean, REALLY loved that game." And he wasn't joking, either.

The controversy surrounding Activision Blizzard has only deepened since then; November saw the release of a damning Wall Street Journal report detailing further alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - with the publication levying particular criticism at CEO Bobby Kotick, claiming he'd been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across the company "for years".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, developer Techland attempted to stir up some additional excitement for the impending arrival of its parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel Dying Light 2 by claiming players would likely need to set aside "at least 500 hours" to fully complete the game. The statement perhaps didn't have quite the desired effect, however, drawing ire from skeptical fans, and the company has now offered further clarification, saying the game should only take around 20 hours to beat at its most fundamental level.
Techland initially made its 500-hour completion claim in a post to Twitter on Saturday, and following a less-than-stellar response to the news - some fans called the extended playtime off-putting - Techland attempted to allay concerns by clarifying the figure only applied when completing all the quests, endings, and exploring every part of the world. Regular players, it said, should "finish the story + side quests... in less than 100 hours".

A new standalone expansion for Serious Sam 4, titled Siberian Mayhem, comes to Steam on 25th January.
Siberian Mayhem, as you might already have deduced, sees Sam trading the comparatively sun-drenched climes of Serious Sam 4 for some chillier action as he journeys across the Russian wilderness in search of the traitorous General Brand - an adventure featuring five "massive" new missions across Arctic coastlines, desolate forests, abandoned villages, and a ghost town.

They estimate that its mantle measured 10 centimeters long &#8212; ­about a third the size of the largest-known magnapinnid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actor Ernie Hudson, perhaps better known as Ghostbusters' Winston Zeddemore, has claimed a new video game based on the legendary movie series is "definitely happening".
This isn't the first time we've heard word of a new Ghostbusters game, of course; back in October, Raphael Saadiq, the co-founder of Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunter Grounds developer Illfonic, let slip that the studio was currently working on the title. Unsurprisingly though, given that the game is still yet to be officially announced, Saadiq hasn't offered any update since, leaving movie fans uncertain of the project's status.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot going on in the world of Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock today; not only has the studio announced it's been acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, it's also just released the first big post-launch content update for its well-received co-op zombie shooter. The latter brings with it a range of tweaks and additions, the most notable of which is a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression.
First the acquisition news; as of today, following Tencent's purchase of Turtle Rock's parent company Slamfire, the studio is now wholly owned by the Chinese conglomerate. According to the announcement, Turtle Rock will continue to operate independently at its Lake Forest, California, offices, with co-founders Phil Robb and Chris Ashton remaining at the helm.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO)

v0.4.0

improvements.
What's new
It has been a while since the last
v0.3.0
release of the operator. We added new features, fine-tuned existing ones and
reworked our documentation in 290 commits over the past half year.
One of the highlights is that we're now able to record seccomp and SELinux
profiles using the operators log enricher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft, you probably don't need telling, is popular; it's sold over 238M copies since its launch in 2009 making it the best-selling game of all time, it claims over 140M monthly active users, and was enticing enough for Microsoft to spend an eye-watering $2.5 billion USD acquiring its developer Mojang back in 2014. And now here's another massive figure for the record books: it's officially the first game to surpass one trillion views on YouTube.
To celebrate the immense milestone, YouTube has launched a new website highlighting the creators and videos that helped Minecraft reach 1,000,000,000,000 views over the last decade - a figure that would, as YouTube points out to put it into some kind of perspective, amount to over 30,000 years if each view equated to just one second of time.

Ubisoft first revealed it would be revisiting the Settlers' much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula in a new series instalment back in 2018. At the time, it told fans to expect the title in autumn the following year but, as that window grew near, the publisher announced a delay, pushing the game's release into 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Candle Games, the developer behind critically acclaimed horror outings Detention and Devotion, has - following a bit of an animated tease earlier this year - formally announced its latest title, an action-platformer loosely inspired by From Software's superb Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice that's currently going by the name of Nine Sols.
Details are extremely limited right now, but Red Candle describes Nine Sols (a working title at present) as a "lore rich hand-drawn 2D platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat". The developer has also shared a wonderfully evocative bit of promo art that - while a significant aesthetic departure from its previous games - does suggest, with its mangled limbs and pools of blood, that we're not exactly in family friendly territory here.

Shenmue 3 is, of course, the long, long, long-awaited third instalment in developer Yu Suzuki's classic action-adventure series, which finally arrived in 2019 following a gap of 18 years between it and its predecessor. Picking up where Shenmue 2 left off, part 3 sees protagonist Ryo Hazuki resume his quest for vengeance after the murder of his father in the original, delivering a new chapter that Eurogamer's Martin Robison called both "archaic and arcane" and "a worthy successor to what many consider an all-time great" in his review.

Kubernetes v1.23 introduced a new, alpha-level policy for
StatefulSets that controls the lifetime of
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) generated from the
StatefulSet spec template for cases when they should be deleted automatically when the StatefulSet
is deleted or pods in the StatefulSet are scaled down.
What problem does this solve?
A StatefulSet spec can include Pod and PVC templates. When a replica is first created, the
Kubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist. The behavior
before Kubernetes v1.23 was that the control plane never cleaned up the PVCs created for
StatefulSets - this was left up to the cluster administrator, or to some add-on automation that
you’d have to find, check suitability, and deploy. The commo…]]></summary>

As with Mullins' previous creations, Inscryption - a dizzyingly strange blend of deck-building rogue-like, escape-room puzzler, and psychological horror - loves to surprise, which inevitably means some deviation away from its opening portion, a engaging combination of sharply designed card battling and Slay-the-Spire-style map progression.

PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) are
associated with Reclaim Policy.
The Reclaim Policy is used to determine the actions that need to be taken by the storage
backend on deletion of the PV.
Where the reclaim policy is Delete, the expectation is that the storage backend
releases the storage resource that was allocated for the PV. In essence, the reclaim
policy needs to honored on PV deletion.
With the recent Kubernetes v1.23 release, an alpha feature lets you configure your
cluster to behave that way and honor the configured reclaim policy.
How did reclaim work in previous Kubernetes releases?

Here, various members of the original Xbox team discuss Microsoft's preparations for the console's launch, which saw the group going on a "barnstorming tour" across America, Europe, and Japan to build excitement and convince developers its machine could be a success.
