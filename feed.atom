<blockquote><p>Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE’s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has ­ without any judicial, legislative or public oversight ­ reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

"We have a special treat for you this month," started 343 community writer Alex Wakeford in a very in-depth blog post yesterday.
"Something that becomes part of the great journey of many Halo fans is learning about all the stuff that didn't make it into the games over the years," he teased before revealing, "I can confirm we are working on a rebuild of the original E3 Earthcity scenario that makes it playable in modern retail Halo 2."

Details on what exactly Microsoft will show remain vague, other than a promise we'll see updates on previously-announced games set to be released over the coming 12 months.

This investigation will allow the company to decide whether or not Microsoft's deal to purchase Activision Blizzard could be deemed anti-competitive. 
"As with all merger reviews, this investigation will consider whether the deal could harm competition and lead to worse outcomes for consumers -- for example, through higher prices, lower quality, or reduced choice," the CMA said today (via GamesIndustry.biz).

The detail was dropped rather unexpectedly last night, as part of an official Xbox Twitch livestream for the game featuring streamer Frank "Techniq" Ellerbe and Marvel's Avengers lead designer Brian Waggoner. 


In an off-the-cuff comment, Ellerbe claimed his acting coach was actually the voice of She-Hulk in the game, to the obvious surprise of Waggoner - who stated that the character had not yet been officially confirmed.

However, in light of the pretty poor reception following its GTA trilogy release last year (yes, I am being generous here), the company has now apparently put these ideas to one side.
Sources with knowledge of Rockstar's inner workings have now confirmed to Kotaku that recent rumours to this effect were indeed true, and we were meant to be getting a shiny new upgrade for both games. Last year's release of the GTA trilogy came as a real blow to Rockstar, however, and now the company is hoping to put all of that bad press behind it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a three-year hiatus due to Covid, Pokémon Go's in-person Go Fests have properly returned. The first of three music festival-sized city gatherings took place this weekend in Berlin and went off smoothly, with the usual mix of rare creatures, boosted Shiny chances and early access to new species.


As ever, it was the feeling of playing Pokémon Go among thousands of others that made the event something special. Along the many pretty paths circling Berlin's beautiful Britzer Garden, thousands of Pokémon players plodded along in groups, with friends or in couples, celebrating rare catches or looking on in envy. 


I wasn't certain about Berlin as a choice for Go Fest, after the smaller German city of Dortmund hosted the game's main European events in previous years so successfully. Not only did Dortmund have a great city park to play in, but its main centre was small enough that when Pokémon Go players turned up, they absolutely took over - fans flooding its small squares and filling restaurant terraces. It created a carnival atmosphere, and seeing the expressions of bemused locals as dozens of people passed by in Pikachu onesies never got old.

Russian speedrunner Mekarazium completed a live run of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance as one of a handful of online (rather than in-person) runs.


However, an extra run of the game's Blade Wolf DLC was offered as a charity donation goal incentive, but Mekarazium has since admitted this run was faked using pre-recorded footage, as PCGamesN reported.

The sale of games, consoles and subscription services contributed to a enormous $191bn global total in 2021, which will fall slightly to $188bn this year, according to Ampere Analysis. 


This follows extraordinary growth through the early stages of the pandemic, with a leap in spending especially noticable from 2020 onwards.

Capcom equates these figures to "a variety of measures including ongoing free updates and the launch of a PC version, as well as with the release of a set that includes Sunbreak."

Ahead of The Last of Us Part 1's release for the PS5 (and eventually PC), content creator Speclizer has revisited the first game in Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic world.


They have since shared a compilation of the incredible inclusions from Naughty Dog, many of which can be easily missed on your average playthrough. I am talking about things like Joel's buttons being embossed with the words "Naughty Button" or being able to spot Tess' bite before she reveals her infection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has confirmed it's shortly pulling the plug on a number of its games, including Anno 2070, Far Cry 3, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, and Assassin's Creed 2.

Most of the games included on the list are getting on a bit, but three-year-old VR game Space Junkies is also getting pulled, and as its a "multiplayer-only title", you will be "unable to play the game going forward".

Whilst the singleplayer features for these games will mostly be unaffected, multiplayer modes or online features may be unavailable after 1st September, along with the ability to buy DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's Santa Monica Studio has now issued a formal statement asking that all players treat its developers "with respect".

As Victoria so perfectly summarised for us at the time, yesterday was a sad day. In less than 24 hours, we got the news that Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert was no longer going to talk about the upcoming release of Return to Monkey Island following online abuse, and God of War Ragnarök's producer had to ask everyone to remain patient while waiting for more news on the game after we learned that some members of the God of War Ragnarök team were receiving unsolicited pictures of their private parts. 

Consequently, Santa Monica Studio today issued a formal statement about the incident via its social media channels.

In a statement posted on Twitter, the lead technical adviser and project manager of Fallout: London, a "DLC-sized" mod for Fallout 4, have both been offered jobs; the former as an associate level designer, and the latter a chance to work on Fallout 76. 

Ryan Johnson took up the new job as an associate level designer, albeit only after ensuring his "expected level design tasks" for the mod were complete and succession planning was in place. Dean Carter, however, decided not to take the Fallout 76 position as they wanted to "continue working [on] Fallout: London until the end".

That's according to the website Playing for the Planet, an UN-led initiative which seeks to use games to "inspire young people to learn and act in support of the environment".

For instance, for Riders Republic, Ubisoft says it will host a "short and intense" in-game event in Phoenix which will promote "strategies to reduce wildfire frequency and size as well as have an emotional impact on players regarding the consequences of wildfires".

General warning, there are some small spoilers for The Quarry below.

It has since transpired that some members of the gaming community have even been sending unsolicited pictures of their private parts to members of the God of War Ragnarök team. They somehow believed that this would suddenly make Sony Santa Monica give the world an update on the game's release date... How they came to this conclusion is beyond me.
Since all of this has happened, prominent members from the industry have been making their voices heard and have called out the toxic behaviour of these so-called fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cult classic cel-shaded shooter XIII was famously remade, and subsequently widely panned, in 2020. However, the remake is getting a second chance, as it is now being basically remade again.
A new statement on the game’s Steam page reads: "To achieve the quality standards and offer an optimal gaming experience, Microids decided to entrust the development of XIII Remake to the French studio Tower Five (Lornsword: Winter Chronicle). Hard at work for more than a year on a major update. This update will be released on September 13th.
"On that date, owners of the game will receive a free update and enjoy the game as intended. The development studio reworked the entire game from the Art Direction to the AI and added numerous technical improvements" (via Kotaku).

During the meeting, which took place on Tuesday, the shareholder asked Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa if the company would consider making new games or remakes of its dormant series, specifically F-Zero.


As translated by VGC, Furukawa replied: "It is realistically difficult to develop new titles and remakes, including sequels, for every Nintendo game that people request, but we are very grateful and appreciate the expectations our fans have for our games."

<blockquote><p>So far, researchers from Lumen Technologies&#8217; Black Lotus Labs say they&#8217;ve identified at least 80 targets infected by the stealthy malware, including routers made by Cisco, Netgear, Asus, and DrayTek. Dubbed ZuoRAT, the remote access Trojan is part of a broader hacking campaign that has existed since at least the fourth quarter of 2020 and continues to operate.</p>
<p>The discovery of custom-built malware written for the MIPS architecture and compiled for small-office and home-office routers is significant, particularly given its range of capabilities. Its ability to enumerate all devices connected to an infected router and collect the DNS lookups and network traffic they send and receive and remain undetected is the hallmark of a highly sophisticated threat actor...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

High School Years, which follows the release of The Sim 4's excellent Werewolves Game Pack earlier this month, does pretty much exactly what you'd assume it does based on its name, giving players the option to send teenage Sims off to Copperdale High for a few years of learning and post-class socialising with peers.


Its first big addition is the new location of Copperdale. Nestled on the banks of Lake LaSuli, this small town plays home to more than just the local high school; it also incorporates a library, the principal's lavish mansion, a thrift store/boba hangout known as ThrifTea, and an amusement park, complete with haunted house, tunnel of love, ferris wheel, and photo booth.

At this café, you can purchase a selection of eats to help Kirby on his quest to free the Waddle Dees, including the Car-Mouth Cake. This cake will cost Kirby 20 coins and will recover some health. But, let's be honest, its reviving properties are not what we really love about it. What we really love is the fact that it is an adorable, edible Carby.
Now, the Kirby Café in Tokyo and Hakata in Japan has updated its menus to include a real Car-Mouth Cake for us to enjoy (I mean, if we are ever in the area).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know it is on its way, but the PS VR2 is still somewhat of a mystery to those of us not privy to the inner workings at Sony. However, one developer has shared (and swiftly removed) a picture of a PS VR2 set out in the real world. 
The picture came from Bit Planet Games, the developer of Ultrawings and its follow up Ultrawings 2. It showed the PS VR2 on a black leather chair.
It wasn't much, with the set not even being in use for the photo, but it was enough to quickly catch the ever-watching eyes of the internet before the developer had a chance to remove the post without anyone noticing it. You can see it for yourself below (via Reddit).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon  Go developer Niantic has reportedly fire 85 to 90 members of its staff and cancelled four of its in-development projects - including a previously announced Transformers game and a collaboration with theatre company Punchdrunk - amid "economic turmoil" for the company.


That's according to Bloomberg, which has shared portions of an email sent to Niantic staff by the company's chief executive officer John Hanke.
In the message, Hanke is said to have blamed today's project cancellations and redundancies - which will affect around 8% of Niantic's workforce - on the company facing "a time of economic turmoil". Hanke reportedly claimed the moves would help "further streamline our operations in order to best position the company to weather any economic storms that may lie ahead."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RimWorld, developer Ludeon Studios' widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim, will finally be making the jump to consoles - some three and a half years after its full PC release - on 29th July.


RimWorld has, of course, made quite the mark on PC since its early access arrival all the way back in 2013 - partly for its wonderfully rich blend of management sim action and procedural storytelling, but equally for the way its complex systems can quickly tumble into outright debauchery, ranging from drug-fuelled cannibalism to non-consensual body harvesting.


Word that a console version of RimWorld was finally on the way arrived in March, although notably not through official channels. Instead, the port - being handled by Double Eleven Limited, which has previously helped port the likes of Minecraft Dungeons and Rust to consoles - hit headlines when it was listed as having been refused classification in Australia.

Tri-Ace, the studio that's been at the helm of the Star Ocean series since its debut in 1996, is once again handling development duties on The Divine Force, which this time follows the stories of dual protagonists Raymond, the captain of the space trading ship Ydas, and Laeticia, the princess-knight of a kingdom on the underdeveloped planet of Aster IV.


Each character offers its own story perspectives and gameplay experiences, and there's a taste of Star Ocean: The Divine Force's ensuing action in the new trailer accompanying today's news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has today unveiled a feast of fresh Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope gameplay footage, showcasing its intriguing new settings, characters and chaos.


This sequel to the excellent Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle takes place in a "whimsical" and gorgeous new galaxy, that's a curious blend of both Mario Galaxy and Rabbids universes. Within its orbit float worlds of autumnal colour, frozen snow and sandy beaches, like a Mario Galaxy game in miniature.


The story here revolves around Cursa, a dark entity that wants to absorb this hybrid galaxy's energy and capture the Sparks - cute creations that are a mix of Galaxy's Lumas and the Rabbids. It's up to Mario and his Kingdom Battle crew to save the day, now aided by Rabbid Rosalina, the punky-looking rabbid Edge, and - as we found out yesterday during the latest Nintendo Direct - Bowser himself.

The first discovery came from self-proclaimed "Switch tinkerer" OatmealDome. In this case, the modder managed to unearth some Half-Life 2 content tucked away in the Portal: Companion Collection's files.
"The entirety of Half-Life 2 (minus maps and music) is present in the ROM," they wrote via Twitter. "Likely based on the NVIDIA Shield port, with a little Xbox 360 sprinkled in."

Despite being out for several years, the Zelda community is still finding countless weird and wonderful ways to approach the game - the most recent of which being a completion of every shrine within the game without using any of the runes on the Sheikah Slate.
Content creator Limcube took on this challenge as part of an incredible 28-hour stream and used a variety of techniques to get to their final goal of 120/120 shrines completed.

However, at the time of writing, no further details have been given about what role any of the actors will play on the show's release (via Variety). 
MacLachlan is probably best known for his role of Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks, as well as Trey MacDougal in Sex and the City and Orson Hodge in Desperate Housewives. For the fellow parents among us, he is also the voice of Riley's father in the very good (and more than just a little bit emotional) Inside Out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantic Lab, a company which provides quality assurance (QA) support, has responded to a claim it misled Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red over its work on the game.


The allegation surfaced this week via a YouTube video from a channel named Upper Echelon Gamers. Titled "What Made Cyberpunk 2077 Fail - Quantic Lab?", the 14-minute video claimed the QA studio had placed junior members of its team on the project instead of seasoned veterans, and flagged too many minor bugs. 


These issues, the video claimed, impacted Quantic Lab's work and therefore the overall game.

The game's developer Proletariat confirmed Spellbreak's end in a blog post today, and confirmed that servers will go dark early next year.


"Breakers, after more than four years of elemental magic and spell combinations, we've made the decision to end development of Spellbreak," Proletariat wrote. "Thank you to the millions of players who have joined us in the Hollow Lands since 2018; it's been an amazing journey."

This is the second time the switch has now occured, after Pac-Mom previously took Ms Pac-Man's place in Bandai Namco's Arcade Archives: Pac-Land earlier this year.


Again, the reason for the swap seems to be the messy legal issues surrounding ownership of Ms Pac-Man, which are the subject of a 2019 lawsuit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The return of the Monkey Island series with the aptly named Return to Monkey Island was a welcome surprise when it was announced earlier this year (on April Fool's Day no less). After all, we had not seen a new game with Guybrush Threepwood at the fore since 2009. 
However, while we are getting a return, this may not be the start of a new wave of games based in the sun-soaked Caribbean islands. Rather, this appears to be the last one of its kind. 
Following its new gameplay trailer yesterday (see above) and the news it will be coming to the Nintendo Switch as a console first, the Return to Monkey Island developers unveiled a new website for the game. It is a great site, with playful interactive options for fans of the series, including the chance to 'chat' with series regular Stan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First impressions of Sonic Frontiers have, it's fair to say, been mixed - but Sega is forging ahead regardless, now offering a look at the game's rendition of Cyber Space, where more "traditional, fast-paced" Sonic stages can be found.


Revealed during today's busy Nintendo Direct, Cyber Space is a mysterious digital realm that can be reached by uncovering ancient entrances around Starfall Islands - a cluster of landmasses incorporating Kronos Island, the lush area seen in Sonic Frontiers' divisive first trailers. 


In order to unlock the Cyber Space entrances, players will first need to earn Portal Gears by solving puzzles and completing challenges around the "open zone" map. Once in Cyber Space, they can try their hand at "traditional, fast-paced, speed running action platforming" - linear stages more in line with classic Sonic action - earning Vault Keys required to progress further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we ready to catapult with full enthusiasm into summer, Microsoft has announced July's Xbox Games with Gold, this time giving subscribers on  Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S access to Torchlight, Thrillville: Off the Rails, Beast of Maravilla Island, and Relicta.


It's not exactly a blockbuster line-up then, but there's certainly some fun to be had. Developer Runic Games' Torchlight, for instance, is an enjoyable Diablo-esque dungeon-crawler from 2009. This isn't the first time it's appeared as part of Xbox Games with Gold though (it was last available in July 2019), so it's entirely possible this one is already hanging around your library.


Thrillville: Off the Rails, meanwhile, is the 2007 sequel to Frontier Developments' Thrillville, an attempt at creating a more accessible spin on the classic theme park sim genre. "It's not complex, it's not challenging, but it's not trying to be," said Eurogamer in its review. "It's an enjoyable family game which also has appeal for retro gaming fans and drunk people."

"It's hard to imagine a Robin without a Batman," muses the masked hero, before resolving that he will figure it all out.

This includes his various attacks and how he can use "teleportation tech from the Justice League's satellite" to "zap [himself] short distances in a fight".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Nintendo Direct highlighted an arry of third-party games coming to Nintendo Switch through the rest of this year and beyond. As expected, the showcase focused on games made by non-Nintendo companies - but there were still plenty of highlights, and several exclusives.


The show kicked off with Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak, which launches this week. A title update with yet more monsters to slay arrives in August, and has the jazzy title of Seething Bazelgeuse. Oh, and there's a demo available now.
Next was the venerable Nier Automata, PlatinumGames' acclaimed role-playing game from 2017. It's now headed to Nintendo Switch via a fresh The End of YoRHa Edition which contains previous DLC and new costumes. It launches on 6th October.

Return to Monkey Island is slated to release sometime this year, and come to consoles first via Nintendo Switch. We have been given some nice titbits of information about its upcoming release, including that it will be starting off at an amusement park (where Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge concluded), but the team has been keeping its cards close to its chest in terms of story and trailer reveals. Well, that was until now.
Today's Nintendo Direct, gave us our first look at some of the game's action, including piratical sword fights, explosive nautical combat, and what appears to be Guybrush in some kind of court (bodes well!). We also got to see some returning faces such as Elaine Marley, LeChuck, Murray the talking skull and Wally (to name but a few).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mega Man Battle Network, Capcom's turn-based take on its iconic action series, is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PC next year. 


Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be bundling some 10 games in total, with a physical release offering the full set while the digital release will be split across two volumes. There'll be extra features such as a music mode featuring some 150 songs and an art gallery containing some 1000 illustrations. 


The Mega Man Battle Network series had an extremely prolific run from 2001 to 2009 on the Game Boy Advance, and was well-received even if it was often hard to distinguish individual titles. There's no release date set for Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection beyond a vague 2023 window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new announcement trailer for Fallout: London is now here, revealing it will release sometime in 2023.
"Fallout: London is a DLC-sized mod for Bethesda's Fallout 4. As a continuation of the base game, the mod will allow the player to visit the previously unexplored post-apocalyptic environment of London," the description explains. 
This mod will be a change from the rest of the Fallout series, as it will not take place in America. The developer hopes this will allow for users to explore "new cultures which have not homogenised with their American counterparts". It will also mean that players can dive on into "pre-war European history, and the effects the Resource Wars had on the class structured society of pre-war Britain."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skyrim has been around for quite the time, with many a new edition or various mod upgrades being made available in its 10 plus years on the market. However, we now also have a mod that covers any version of Skyrim that releases even further down the line (which, let's be honest, will likely happen).
The mod in question comes from Nexus Mods user xilamonstrr and brings Skyrim's big scaly dragons into super sharp focus. I am talking about seeing all the little details, right down to each beast's scars, in much, much, higher definition. 
And, while 16k may seem a touch excessive given that most games tend to opt for 1440p, xilamonstrr has a good reason for choosing this resolution. In short, the dragons in Skyrim are huge, and therefore their textures can get stretched more than the other enemies and entities in this world.

Today's announcement stream is set to feature third-party games for Nintendo Switch - of which Sparks of Hope is a prime example. It seems likely we'll see this made official then.

Ubisoft's decision comes after the recent pull-outs from Sony, Nintendo, Activision Blizzard and Take-Two, which have all chosen not to attend. Microsoft has yet to make an announcement - though it's unclear what it might bring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Nightdive Studios has announced that its critically panned remaster of Westwood Studios' classic point-and-click adventure Blade Runner will now include the well-recieved ScummVM version of the original game on Steam.


Nightdive's remaster was announced back in March 2020, but the project appeared to be on a permanent hiatus after the studio told Eurogamer it was struggling to overcome certain "obstacles". It was a bit of a surprise, then, when Nightdive's long-awaited Enhanced Edition of Blade Runner resurfaced earlier this month with a 23rd June release date, but perhaps less of a surprise, given its history, when the remaster launched to less-than-stellar reviews.


For those that purchased the game via GOG, there was some respite in that all copies of the remaster came with the previously available ScummVM version, developed by a dedicated group of enthusiasts. Steam purchasers, however, were stuck with Nightdive's inferior remaster - until today, that is, when the studio revealed it would adding the ScummVM version as an alternative download for all purchases.

That's according to the persistently leaky Jeff Grubb, who shared the news on Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, saying he'd been told "pretty definitively" that an updated version of Metroid Prime 1 - what he referred to as Metroid Prime Remastered - was set to be one of Nintendo's "big holiday games" for 2022.


"In the past, this is something I'd heard was in the works," Grubb explained, "they have things happening with that game. Now I’ve been told that their plans are to release that game this holiday - I think almost certainly to line up with the 20th anniversary in November."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Fall Guys' successful, if slightly controversial, switch to free-to-play last week, developer Mediatonic has been plugging away to fix any launch week woes, and those continuing efforts have now manifested in a new patch which, among other things, should now enable PS5 players to get into games while in parties.
Beyond that headline fix, and tweaks to resolve a seperate bug preventing players from hearing party members in voice chat, Mediatonic's latest patch notes suggest an update primarily targeting smaller issues across all versions of the game, rather than anything particularly seismic, with other fixes including a range of visual issues on Switch. Here's the full list of tweaks and adjustments, for the curious, as per the Fall Guys Twitter account:
Fall Guys' transition to a free-to-pay model seems to have paid off for Mediatonic. Despite some server wobbles on launch day, the developer reported Fall Guy's new monetisation model - combined with its launch on two new platforms in Xbox and Switch - managed to push the game's player base over the 20m mark just 24 hours after its free-to-play release.

A fresh video detailing work on the project has revealed the remake's newly-stitched-together open world, and promises further additions in future - such as improvements to the game's vehicles, the addition of online multiplayer, a quest system and revamped graphics. 


The project's re-emergence now is a little surprising, since an earlier version was previously pulled offline from creator Reuben "Reubs" Ward's Patreon to avoid getting into any potential legal issues.

The studio's website states that Fntastic's "culture" is "based on the idea of volunteering" and, as such, "every Fntastic member is a volunteer" - paid or not (thanks, Well Played). 
These types of "volunteers" are divided into two categories: full-time and part-time. A full-time volunteer is apparently paid a salary, while a part-time volunteer is expected to take part in "various activities ranging from translating to community moderating". Writes Fntastic: "Part-time volunteers also can offer their unique skills to improve our projects or create new special features."

"I quit after three episodes of season one," Kojima wrote on Twitter, discussing the series. "I thought I'd watch the rest of the show. Actually, I watched a few episodes that were delivered at the time when I was about to start a project that I had been warming up for a long time and put it on hold because the concept was similar (different settings and tricks)."
Kojima went on to state his project would have been a "buddy (male/female) thing with a special detective squad facing off against legendary heroes behind the scenes." As well as this, Kojima had none other than Hannibal's Mads Mikkelsen in mind as his leading man.

Zelda series boss Eiji Aounuma was all set to use a theremin as Link's musical instrument of choice, with each control stick on the GameCube pad set to control each of Link's hands as he manipulated its volume and pitch.

In response to an article reporting one such way of doing this, Yang replied: "Hi, please don't do this. The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved. In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for."
Yang finished by writing that, while the mod in question "may appear to work", it will "significantly shorten the life of your Deck". So, certainly something that is best avoided.

That's because of the game's all new progression and monetisation systems that were introduced when the game switched to a free-to-play model earlier this week.

As spotted by Gamerant, players can still level up their battle pass, but with new daily, weekly, and long-term challenges also now available, it seems as though maximising those will help you progress faster than winning matches... and given the time it takes to secure a winning crown, you could potentially earn the same amount of Fame more quickly just by crashing out in early rounds.

The news follows rating board confirmations in other parts of the world, too, including Brazil and Australia, and a leak of Skull & Bones' four-minute tutorial video back in April, which Ubisoft eventually confirmed was real.

The description shared on the ESRB website is the closest we've come to getting an idea of what the game - which is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox Series - entails since it underwent "extensive reworking" a couple of years back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games has confirmed that from 13th July, it will begin collecting "in-game voice communications" in North America in a bid to combat "disruptive behaviour".

In a brief update on Valorant's offical website, Riot Games explained that as part of its "larger effort to combat disruptive behaviour", the company has updated its Privacy Notice and Terms of Service to allow recording and evaluation of in-game voice communications.

The post stresses that these recordings will only be evaluated when "a report for [negative] behaviour is submitted" and the system will originally kick off in Valorant before - once the "tech [is] in a good enough place" - it will be rolled out to other games.

According to GamesBeat, Stolar - whose career started in 1980 when he set up his own coin-op arcade company - died in California. He had always been a very candid and transparent executive who talked openly about his triumphs and mistakes over the years.

"I loved working for Sony," Stolar once said, according to GB. "I really did. But when the opportunity came up to go to Sega and help rebuild the business and come up with new hardware, I was very interested in doing it. I wouldn’t have left Sony if I hadn’t also lived in fear of getting fired along with everyone else, though.

Whilst it's "mostly a modding-focused update", creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone says there "will be some new content", but advised players to temper expectations, as it "won't be huge".

Asked if his follow-up game, Haunted Chocolatier, will have references to the wholesome farming sim, Barone said that there would be, but said he didn't know "how deep the connection will be" as he's keen for his upcoming title to "have its own identity".

As spotted by Gematsu (thanks, PC Gamer), back in 2018, studio boss Hidetaka Miyazaki said that "3.5" of the games the team was currently working on were unannounced, and 4Gamer reached out to ask Miyazaki on their progress. 

Since that time, we've had Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, PSVR game, Déraciné, and Elden Ring, of course. That leaves just one mysterious game yet to be announced, which may or may not be that heavily-rumoured Armored Core instalment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie and a number of PlayStation studios, including Insoniac and Sucker Punch, have spoken out in support of reproductive rights following today's decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn key legislation granting individuals the constitutional right to choose an abortion - a move that gives US states the power to either severely restrict or ban the practice.


Bungie was one of the first studios to make a statement in May after the US Supreme Court's plans to overthrow Roe v Wade were leaked to the press, calling the move a "direct attack on human rights". Adding to that sentiment in a new statement shared today, it said, "Standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values."


"Last month, we stated without reservation that all of us deserve to choose our own path and access the healthcare we need," the developer continued. "The decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade cuts off millions of Americans from that access and leaves open the possibility of even further restrictions on life-saving healthcare for all of us."

And, of course, the company has not missed out on a golden opportunity to remind us all of its many IPs, from Horizon and Uncharted to Bloodborne, Ghost of Tsushima and more. 
The new trailer, which is simply called Mr. Malcom, takes us on a journey into a "mystifying and intriguing world, showcasing the lives that anyone can live, through wonderful gaming experiences". It all starts off seemingly benign, with the titular Mr Malcom enjoying a meal out before buying himself some nice juicy meat from the butcher. 
However, it soon becomes more and more surreal, as Mr. Malcom makes his way home and back to his eclectic collection. Also, that meat I just mentioned... it wasn't actually for him. You can check out the trailer for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actor Chris Pratt has been discussing his - somewhat controversial - role in the upcoming CGI Super Mario Bros. movie, telling Variety that his take on the title character will be "updated and unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world before."


Mario has, of course, been voiced by Charles Martinet since 1992, and his video game performance has become inseparable from Nintendo's flagship character. As such, Mario fans were somewhat aghast last year when Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto announced Pratt would be replacing Martinet as the voice of Mario in the upcoming film.


It's a casting decision that few seemed to have warmed to even ten months on, despite the best efforts of Chris Meledandri, producer of the Super Mario film, who insisted Pratt's performance as Mario was "phenomenal" last November. Meledandri then defended his star again this week, saying criticism of Pratt's casting would "evaporate" when people heard his performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - also available in audio form! - we look in detail at today's final rollout of PlayStation Plus Premium, which is now available in the UK and mainland Europe.

We now know all of the games included in the PlayStation Plus Premium catalogue at launch and it's enough to hit Sony's promises, certainly, though there are still odd omissions. The lack of 60Hz for some PS1 games (for now) also points to a rather rushed release, despite the extra weeks we've waited on these shores.

So, what can Sony do to build on this launch and improve the new PlayStation Plus Premium further? And, after all that, have we ended up subscribing ourselves? Eurogamer's Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

"Xbox has been supporting keyboard and mouse for a few years now, and we're working on adding it to streaming for PC users," explained Microsoft's Morgan Brown in a new game dev video (via The Verge). "But you can start adding it to your game right now and your console keyboard and mouse users will appreciate it. It will light up in streaming once we've finished adding it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If an entire universe in the palm of your hand sounds neat, you're probably already excited about the launch of exploratory space sim No Man's Sky on Switch. And it turns out the wait for its arrival won't go on too much longer, with developer Hello Games having now confirmed it'll be coming to Nintendo's console - initially as a single-player-only experience - on 7th October.


No Man's Sky, of course, launched for PC and PS4 back in the summer of 2016, giving players an entire procedural universe to explore as their whims took them. That initial version memorably came in for some criticism, but Hello Games has continued to expand on the game's solid survival core since then, delivering over 19, often significant, free updates.


These have introduced the likes of base building, bobbleheads, farming, giant customisable space freighters, land and water vehicles, pilotable mechs, living ships, alien-infested space derelicts, new flora and fauna, pets, live-service-style community expeditions, music tools, sand worms, and more - all of which should be included at launch on Switch.

The game, which is known as Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City - The Board Game, comes from a collaboration with CMON, whose other works include Zombicide, Blood Rage, The Others, Rising Sun, Massive Darkness and Arcadia Quest, to name but a few. 
It sees up to four players taking on the role of the ruthless gangs vying for control in the "glittering hellhole" of Night City (much as the name suggests).

Ahead of time, Sony had promised "up to 400" PlayStation 4 and PS5 games would be available to both PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tier subscribers - though the initial launch in Asia fell well short. Eurogamer's list of PS4 and PS5 games available today comes to 429.

But in 2013, Edward Snowden disclosed that the National Security Agency had subverted the integrity of a NIST cryptographic standard­the Dual_EC_DRBG­enabling easy decryption of supposedly secured communications. This discovery reinforced the desire of some public and private entities to develop their own cryptographic standards instead of relying on a U.S. government process. Yet, a decade later, no credible alternative to NIST has emerged. NIST remains the only viable candidate for effectively developing internationally trusted cryptography standards...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The film is currently the eighth-biggest film launch worldwide this year, but, as Deadline reports, this place is likely to jump up a few notches with the film still to release in both Hong Kong and Japan. 
These numbers are a pretty impressive sight, but perhaps not unexpected. After all, Sonic 2 reportedly enjoyed the greatest opening weekend for any video-game based movie ever on its release in April.

The handheld shoot 'em-up, originally launched in 2008, can be found by searching directly for the title in the PlayStation Store (thanks to reddit user Turb0_Thunder).


You won't find it (yet) via the Classic Catalogue menu, although it's unclear if this is because it's not due to go live yet, or a deliberate secret. (Either way, PlayStation's store interface isn't the clearest to filter and search through.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a good while since Square Enix's troubled live-service action-adventure Marvel's Avengers got itself a new playable hero - its most recent addition was the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man at the end of last year - but that drought will finally come to an end next Tuesday, 28th June, with the arrival of Jane Foster's Mighty Thor.


When developer Crystal Dynamics first confirmed Foster was to be Marvel's Avengers' next playable hero, the studio said the character would have "a lot in common" with the version of Thor already in-game, albeit with "elements that are distinctly Jane".


Crystal Dynamics has since expanded on that, revealing Foster will arrive with a few new baseline abilities setting her apart from Odinson, including a new ranged combo and new ranged power attack. There's also her new Intrinsic ability (All-Mother's Blessing), a new Overcharge ability (God Tempest), and a new Ultimate ability (All-Weapon) enabling her to smite foes using both the Undrjarn and Mjölnir.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite running into some considerable set-backs shortly after its initial announcement, leading to an indefinite delay, developer Nightdive Studios' highly anticipated remaster of Westwood Studio's classic Blade Runner point-and-click adventure is finally complete, and will be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, tomorrow, 23rd June.


The Blade Runner game, for those unfamiliar, released in 1997, and, unlike the vast majority of licensed adaptations, was an extraordinary piece of work, not only managing to perfectly capture the neon-streaked dystopian atmosphere of the movie in a story that ran parallel to its action, but doing so in ways both wildly ambitious and legitimately groundbreaking.


Although Blade Runner takes its cue from narrative-driven point-and-click games, it immediately distinguishes itself from its genre peers by sending players, in the role of Blade Runner Ray McCoy, on a heavily randomised adventure. The goal remains the same each play-through, in that players must use their investigatory skills to identify and hunt down a number of replicants, but exactly which characters are replicants is determined at the start of a new game, subtly changing their behaviour as the story unfolds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Creative Assembly has finally unmasked Hyenas, its long-in-the-works sci-fi shooter - and while Alien Isolation fans might be a little disappointed to see it's not a much-hoped for successor, anyone who's ever dreamed of doing heists in a space should be very cheerful.


Creative Assembly first revealed it was working on a sci-fi shooter back in September 2018, calling it an "ambitious multiplayer title" and a "fresh take on the FPS genre" that would enable players to "embrace a variety of creative playstyles". Almost four years later, that project has now been named as Hyenas, a "ballsy entry into the most competitive genre in gaming".


"In Hyenas, the world is broken... literally," explains Creative Assembly. "The billionaires have finally made it to Mars, leaving Earth and those tax bills far behind. The zero-gravity tech that powered their journey has shattered our planet, abandoning us in a drifting slum called the 'Taint'. The only thing the rich care for is rare Merch, pop culture swag from the lives we left behind, which they loot from the rubble to furnish their Martian mansions."

Some fans had feared the concept would be cut - as other pandemic-era bonuses and gameplay have already been - especially as Niantic recently announced a new in-person only raid variety, which will debut this weekend for the game's next Community Day.


"That's a unique experience that we're setting up just for these extra bonuses in Community Day," Pokémon Go game director Michael Steranka told me today, referring to the bonuses players will get to extend their local Community Day experience by taking part in the game's new in-person-only event raids.

YouTuber MythyMoo used an item and boss randomiser mod that mixes up the placement of acquired items and bosses, which can massively impact the difficulty of a run. The mod also mixes up the names of each boss.


Except, as PCGamesN reports, things took a turn when MythyMoo arrived in the Consecrated Snowfield, an area with various field bosses.

The ability to rate a game on a five-star scale will be randomly offered to owners of that title who have played it for more than two hours. 


"Because these requests are randomised, we won't spam our players, and we probably won't ask about every game or app used," Epic Games' Craig Pearson explained. "This approach protects games from review bombing and ensures people assigning scores are actual players of the games."

There was plenty more shown off, with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 thankfully dialling back some of the anime excesses of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - there was not a single improbably proportioned sidekick to be seen - while restoring some of the scale and wonder of Xenoblade Chronicles X. 


Set on the planet of Aionios, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is set against a backdrop of warring factions from the nations of Keves and Agnos, and a world in which people have pre-determined lifespans of 10 years. Your party is drawn from three characters from each side who've put their differences aside - and opening up a broader, deeper take on combat that's rich with systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After last season's King Kong x Godzilla battle, Activision's flagship battle royale gets even wackier with an appearance of The Terminator. 


Better yet, you're spoiled for choice, with Season four of Warzone giving you the option to play as the orginal T-800 or its succesor the T-1000 (Schwarzenegger voice lines not included).


Activision being Activision, the two Terminators are not bundled together, but rather as seperate time-limited packs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new update for Gran Turismo 7 lands early tomorrow, bringing three new cars previously teased as well as the surprise introduction of a track that's entirely new to Polyphony Digital's series. 


Watkins Glen International is a staple of the US racing scene, playing host to F1 until it was deemed unsafe after a series of fatal accidents. It's a ramshackle kind of place that now plays host to the likes of IMSA and NASCAR, and it's an absolute delight to drive either of the configurations that are on offer in Gran Turismo 7's take on the track. 


There's a trio of new cars too, with a brace of Suzukis including a new fictional 'Vision' car alongside the iconic V6 Escudo Pikes Peak Special (now how about putting Pikes Peak in the game, seeing as Gran Turismo's been squatting on the official licence for the legendary course for a while?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 will include party members in combat, despite the fact that recent trailers have focused solely on protagonist Clive.


Fans have speculated whether other characters will join battles, which producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed to IGN - although they will remain AI-controlled.


"We didn't want to overwhelm users in our newest trailer, so we focused solely on Clive's battles. That said, for most of his journey, Clive will be accompanied by one or more companions. These companions will participate in battle, as well as trade banter with Clive. That said, the party members will be AI-driven so as to allow players to focus solely on controlling Clive," said Yoshida.

In a PlayStation Blog interview, the Final Fantasy 16 producer describes how he was honoured to be offered the opportunity to work on a single-player game in the series, but thought fans may criticise him.



"I said 'Thanks, but I have my hands full with Final Fantasy 14, so let me think about it.' I was truly honoured that the company would choose my section, Creative Business Unit 3, to be responsible for making the next entry in the FF series. But, as you probably know, I'm already the producer and director of Final Fantasy 14. I was worried that if I took on the directorship of 16, too, fans of both games would have good reason to believe I wasn't giving either project my full attention," said Yoshida.

Speaking to Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, DICE's recently-appointed general manager Rebecka Coutaz confirmed any project such as Mirror's Edge was currently sat on the backburner.

Previously, players in a convoy would be booted off when the host starts a story mission.

The annual European show, held in Cologne, was traditionally the world's largest in terms of visitors. This summer will see Gamescom return as a physical event for the first time since 2019, albeit with fewer publishers in attendance. 

PlayStation confirmed its decision to skip Gamescom 2022 in a statement to German publication Games Wirtschaft (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), where it also confirmed it would not feature any announcements in the show's Geoff Keighley-fronted livestream Opening Night Live.

Producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed the news in an interview with IGN, although he said that recent open world games have provided "inspiration".


"We've found in our extensive user research that many of the younger generation of gamers have never played a Final Fantasy or don't have any interest in the series. To create a game that might excite and resonate not only with our core fans, but also with that new generation, we played a lot of games ourselves, and so yes, in [Final Fantasy 16] you'll find inspiration from recent triple-A open world RPGs," said Yoshida.

A "peaceful protest" to "#SaveTF2" was organised by fans in May to raise awareness of the game's many bugs, its ongoing bot problems, and the general lack of updates by Valve despite TF2's ongoing popularity.


In response, Valve said it had heard the game's community. "We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things," it wrote shortly after.

Dragonflight also adds the Dracthyr Evokers - a new playable race-class hybrid that can, depending on a players' chosen class specialisations, focus on either damage dealing or healing - plus a new skill-based flight system tied to customisable dragon companions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard shareholders have voted to approve a proposal that the company should publish an annual report detailing the effectiveness and outcomes of its efforts to prevent abuse, harassment, and discrimination in its workplace - a non-binding vote Activision has, as yet, only said it will "carefully consider".


The proposal, originally raised by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli in February, requested that Activision publically release an annual report detailing several key metrics: the total number of pending sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or ligation; details of the company's progress toward reducing the average time it takes to resolve sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints; the amount of money it has spent settling disputes related to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, and finally pay and hours worked consolidated data.


While this kind of transparency might seem prudent given the shocking allegations that have surfaced in relation to Activision Blizzard's workplace practices over the last year, and given that the publisher remains embroiled in a number of lawsuits relating to those practices - including last July's State of California filing, which called the company a "breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women" - the company's board of directors instead wrote to shareholders in May unanimously urging them to vote against the proposal.

Raft, if you're unfamiliar, first started to attract attention as a free prototype on itch.io back in 2016. Redbeet steadily expanded on that version's core survival loop - in which players start out on a tiny wooden raft in the middle of the ocean, hooking up foods, supplies, and building materials until their tiny vessel is a veritable sea-faring palace - in preparation for a commercial early access release on Steam, which finally arrived in 2018.


Since then, Redbeet has continued to build on that early feature set, introducing the likes of online co-op, explorable islands, underwater reefs, crop growing, cooking, animal care, and even a full story campaign in which players can learn more about the flooded world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planet Zoo's steady stream of post-launch DLC continues today with the arrival of its 11th paid expansion, the eco-themed Conservation Pack, on Steam, introducing a selection of new, endangered animals, new scenery items, and more.


On the animal front, Planet Zoo's Conservation Pack brings five new additions - Przewalski's horse, amur leopard, scimitar-horned oryx, siamang, and axolotl - all of which are considered at-risk species as a result of climate change, poaching, and habitat degradation.


Elsewhere, the DLC introduces a new scenario challenging players to assist the Turtlerock Wildlife Orphanage, inspired by Mongolia's Gorkhi Terelj National Park, by rescuing, raising, documenting and releasing as many species as possible. Renewable energy, plant diversity, and sustainability will be an important focus too.

Released on Epic, PlayStation, and Xbox in March, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands takes the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2's much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep and spins it out into a full-sized game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


The game-within-a-game premise casts players as an unnamed "newbie" in the real, Borderlands world who's taking part in a D&D-like game called Bunkers and Badasses. Several celebrity-voiced friends are along for the ride, as is the irrepressible Tina, as Dungeon Master.

The increasingly bitter fight between the two companies escalated significantly last week with the issuing of a press release by a legal firm associated with Oovee containing numerous claims directed at Saber, and the brief return of Spintires to Steam despite its previous delisting in the wake of another legal challenge. 


Saber has subsequently filed a defamation claim in relation to Oovee's allegations, Eurogamer can also reveal, while Spintires' Steam page is now back offline pending various DMCA challenges.

It therefore won't be available on iOS version 13.0 or earlier, according to a rough translation of the tweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA's Battlefield 2042 has attracted its fair share of controversy since it launched last November, with players unhappy with the omission of key features at launch as well as some questionable design decisions which resulted in fan backlash. 


There have been updates since release that have corrected the course of Battlefield 2042, with the belated launch of its first season earlier this month introducing a new map and features that have gone down well with the game's community. 


Despite these updates, however, Battlefield 2042 still has players fighting under a Russian flag as one of the two factions in the game - a decision that sits uncomfortably given the invasion of Ukraine from Russian forces, and in light of EA's decision to remove Russian clubs and the Russian national football team from FIFA 22, FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online.

However, for those that are keen for more thrills (and bloody spills) in its horror-filled world, fear not, as fans have your backs. 
A remake of the original Silent Hill is currently being made in Unreal Engine 5 by a group called Codeless Games (via DSO Gaming). And not only is it in development, but we have also been given a peak at 10 minutes of gameplay that focuses on Midwich Elementary School (a major building that protagonist Harry Mason explores in a bid to find his missing daughter). 
This project does a pretty good job at setting the scene and overall atmosphere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 may be a lot of things to a lot of different people, but one thing most would probably agree on is that it's a bloody big console. Now, however, one enterprising YouTuber has taken up the challenge of downsizing the machine to create the "world's first PS5 Slim console" - one that's less than 2cm thick.


The project is the work of YouTube channel DIY Perks, which specialises in videos about designing and building gadgets and technology at home, and begins with a tear-down of Sony's behemoth console to figure exactly which of its innards should stay and wish can go to hit that 2cm target.


Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of the PS5's bulk comes from its steel shrouding and CPU-cooling heatsink, and with those gone, DIY Perk's target seems a little closer to reality. Ultimately, to hit that magic number, PS5's existing cooling solution is replaced with a custom water-channeling system made from copper sheeting. It's not a cheap option, costing an eyewatering $240 for the sheeting alone, but it appears to do the job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the launch of its first major expansion approaches, Outriders - developer People Can Fly's enjoyable third-person sci-fi shooter - is free to try on Steam this week, giving new players an opportunity to see what they're missing.


Outriders launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation last April, delivering a slice of co-operative shooter action that Eurogamer reviewer Vikki Blake enjoyed, albeit with some caveats. "For some," she wrote, "I suspect Outriders doesn't innovate enough to stand out from an already oversaturated shooter market, relying too much on the ideas of other, stronger titles that have come before it."


"[But] as a die-hard Guardian and card-carrying fangirl of the genre," Vikki continued, "Outriders tickles me in all the right places. Offering gunplay that feels solid and satisfying and an array of additional powers and abilities to keep combat fresh and exciting, I can only admit that Outriders has surprised me in all the right ways. Maybe it'll surprise you, too."

Dune: Spice Wars was well-received when it launched into Steam early access back in April, but several key features were missing from that initial release, including all-important multiplayer support. Shiro eventually confirmed multiplayer would arrive this "summer" as part of its inaugural development roadmap, and that day is finally here.


According to today's patch notes, Dune's multiplayer can utilise both dedicated servers and peer-to-peer connections, and enables players to try their hand at 2v2 matches or test their mettle in four-person free-for-alls, playing as Atreides, Harkonnen, Fremen, or Smugglers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its Xbox, PlayStation, and PC debut last month, Ubisoft's free-to-play 3v3 skater Roller Champions has been given a Switch release date, and will, according to a new UK eShop listing, arrive on Nintendo's platform tomorrow, 21st June.


Roller Champions is Ubisoft's stab at creating its own chaotic sports mash-up in the vein of Rocket League, albeit one that switches out the latter's cars-meet-football concept for a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football.


The gist is that two teams of three players hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another. When one team finally has the ball, they need to complete at least one lap before pelting it into the goal, with additional points accrued the more laps they can keep hold of it before taking a successful shot.

How does it work? He wears two gloves that have motion sensors and a stick in each hand for movement. Simply punching the air is enough for light attacks, with other motions used for heavy attacks and parries, and then picking up items and other interactions are done by clicking in the sticks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alice: Madness Returns has once again disappeared from Steam.

Alice's disappearance will be particularly frustrating for some, as the 2011 game only returned to Steam in February 2022 after a DRM issue saw it removed from sale for almost five years. Now, just a few months later, it's gone again.

The reason for its sudden and unexpected disappearance? It's not entirely clear. Steam's not giving away much; Alice: Madness Returns' Steam page simply says "at the request of the publisher, Alice: Madness Returns is no longer available for sale on Steam", which is a blanket statement that covers pretty much anything and everything.

Yesterday, developer Void Interactive tweeted that it was dealing with a "suggested trademark infringement" of its "recent Night Club map" which rolled out as part of the early access game's most recent update earlier in the week.

"We take IP concerns very seriously, and in a show of good faith, we have decided to remove the subject materials and any reference to them from Ready or Not and from any of our social media or other publications," Void said (thanks, NME).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew that Lego Brawls - a minifigure fighting game previously launched on Apple Arcade - was set to relaunch this summer on consoles and now we have a release date: 2nd September, 2022.

Published by Bandai Namco, the fighter will arrive on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S where the Smash Bros-like brawl will let "Minifigure mayhem begin". Here's a new teaser to celebrate:

As Tom explained at the time the ports were announced, the idea here is to battle - solo or with up to eight network players - and collect minifigures which you can then customise to create your own hero of choice. You can then take said hero and attempt to tackle the game's global leaderboards.

As spotted by PCGN, a number of new items introduced along with the Werewolf expansion have descriptions that players of Square Enix's hugely-popular MMORPG may find familiar. 

There's the Racked Teak-a Greatshelves - a fantastic, if not particularly subtle, nod to Shadowbringers' Rak'tika Greatwood where the Viera live - as well as a reference to the game's theme track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite its controversial launch, Diablo Immortal - Blizzard's pocket-sized Diablo experience - has generated almost £20 million ($24m) since it launched earlier this month.

According to the analysts at Appmagic (thanks, Pocket Gamer), that makes Diablo Immortal - which has been downloaded over eight million times in just a fortnight - one of Blizzard's biggest mobile app, second only to the immense popularity of Hearthstone. 

The game has seen its biggest success in the US, which accounts for 26 per cent of all downloads. This is followed by South Korea, Brazil, and Japan, with 11 per cent, 8 per cent, and 8 per cent of the market share respectively. The UK only features in the 17 per cent "other" category which aggregates low-level figures across the rest of the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, developer Supermassive released its sumputous slasher horror The Quarry on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in collaboration with publisher 2K Games - but a new report has claimed the game was originally in development as a "signature" title for Stadia, before Google made the decision to downsize its gaming operation and send the project elsewhere.


Stadia, of course, launched to much fanfare in 2019, and part of Google's promise to early adopters was that the service would bring its own console-like exclusives from both first- and third-parties. To that end, Google established its own internal game development studio and signed deals with external developers, including Supermassive, as announced in 2020.


Those plans, however, changed dramatically just 14 months after Stadia's high-profile arrival, with Google announcing a major rethink of its cloud streaming strategy following a less-than-stellar launch, which included the cancellation of all internal game development as it began prioritising selling its tech to third-parties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its ongoing war against cheaters, the team behind Call of Duty's server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, known as Ricochet, has unveiled a new mitigation technique that takes a player's weapons (and fists) away when the system identifies them as a cheater.


Word of this latest mitigation technique comes via a new blog update detailing the current state of Call of Duty's anti-cheat solution, and follows previously revealed anti-cheat techniques Cloaking and Damage Shield.


Damage Shield, Richochet's first major mitigation technique, essentially works by turning on God Mode for all legitimate players when a cheater is detected in-match. Cloaking, meanwhile, makes it impossible for detected cheaters to see opponents and bullets, or even hear sounds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced this year's ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest event, which promises to deliver over 30 playable pre-release Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S demos starting next week.


Things kick off next Tuesday, 21st June and the event's demos will remain available to play for seven days, with proceedings coming to a close the following Monday, 27th June.


"These 'game demos' are not the norm," Microsoft notes in its announcement post. "Typically, the demos you see in our Demo channel are created after the game is completed (or nearly completed) and represents an almost final to final version. Think of these as akin to 'show floor demos' and not necessarily indicative of the final product."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard has confirmed Overwatch 2, which will be an "always on, always evolving" free-to-play game when it launches into early access on 4th October, will be ditching its predecessor's lootboxes in favour of a seasonal battle pass and in-game store.


That news was shared during an extended Overwatch 2 livestream this evening, primarily focused on the game's live-service model and seasonal content plan - the latter of which, according to Overwatch 2's game director Aaron Keller, will enable Blizzard to deliver new content to players on a more "frequent and consistent" basis compared to the original game.


Each season will last nine weeks and alternately add a new hero then a new map. That's a little different for season 1, however, with Blizzard promising three new heroes, six new maps, the new Push game mode, weekly challenges, 30+ new skins, and a new mythic skin when things get underway on 4th October in tandem with Overwatch 2's early access launch.

In response to multiple lawsuits against the company, Activision Blizzard conducted its own investigation and has published the findings.


"Contrary to many of the allegations, the Board and its external advisors have determined that there is no evidence to suggest that Activision Blizzard senior executives ever intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported," reads the report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we're ready to round off this two-week not-E3 announcement bonanza with a chat about Starfield, and a look to the future.

Starfield dominated Microsoft and Bethesda's E3 event and was arguably the biggest game on show over the fortnight, though praise was hardly unanimous. It looked like a Bethesda RPG, many said, somehow not expecting exactly just that. Between the news you can't fly to space and won't have a voice, was it really as disappointing as some have made out?


Finally, with this main glut of not-E3 conferences done and dusted, talk turns to next year - when 2023 will see the return of both E3 and Summer Game Fest as in-person events. What will that look like, and will things be less messy in twelve months? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

The map, titled "Fortune’s Keep", features several key locations including Keep, a towering structure which houses 20 cannons, 10 staircases, 12 rooms and a fountain, and Smuggler's Cove, another area with a focus on verticality, which includes eight ladders, three ziplines, eight huts and 11 boats.

Given the approximate size of Fortune's Keep, one could speculate that this new map could replace Rebirth Island, the secondary map first introduced to Warzone with the release of Black Ops: Cold War.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The high energy costs of neural network training and inference led to the use of acceleration hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. While such devices enable us to train large-scale neural networks in datacenters and deploy them on edge devices, their designers&#8217; focus so far is on average-case performance. In this work, we introduce a novel threat vector against neural networks whose energy consumption or decision latency are critical. We show how adversaries can exploit carefully-crafted sponge examples, which are inputs designed to maximise energy consumption and latency, to drive machine learning (ML) systems towards their worst-case performance. Sponge examples are, to our knowledge, the first denial-of-service attack against the ML components of such systems. We mount two variants of our sponge attack on a wide range of state-of-the-art neural network models, and find that language models are surprisingly vulnerable. Sponge examples frequently increase both latency and energy consumption of these models by a factor of 30×. Extensive experiments show that our new attack is effective across different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU and an ASIC simulator) on a wide range of different language tasks. On vision tasks, we show that sponge examples can be produced and a latency degradation observed, but the effect is less pronounced. To demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge examples in the real world, we mount an attack against Microsoft Azure&#8217;s translator and show an increase of response time from 1ms to 6s (6000×). We conclude by proposing a defense strategy: shifting the analysis of energy consumption in hardware from an average-case to a worst-case perspective...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another day, another case of Nintendo being Nintendo. This time, the company is cracking down on a YouTuber that uploaded covers of music from Metroid Prime to their channel.
Content creator SynaMax revealed that nine of his videos have had to be taken down, after Nintendo sent in the big guns and flexed their legal muscles his way.
"On 31st May, a lawyer representing Nintendo called me and asked me to take down nine videos off the channel," SynaMax explained in a new video (spotted by VGC). "I'm really disappointed in Nintendo that they would force me to take down these videos because they want compulsory licenses."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto has explained what the game's "Open Zone" structure really means.


Speaking to IGN, Kishimoto's comments somewhat clarify what separates Sonic Frontiers from open-world games.


"Level-based platformers often have a world map. Our Open Zone is a world map, only we've made it entirely playable," said Kishimoto.

Speaking to IGN, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith revealed, "whoever hosts the session, or whoever initiates the session... their progress is persistent for them. But [for] other people, it's not. In terms of what missions you've unlocked and such, the host, their progression matters."
He went on to explain, "if you sign on with a friend and they're halfway through the game, and you play the second half of the game with them and then you need to go back and you want to play on your own, you'll be starting at the beginning of the campaign with a character".

After the Capcom showcase, the publisher released a free upgrade across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, adding in ray-tracing, 4K support, and 3D audio.


However, on PC the new version had increased minimum system requirements and was unable to revert back to the previous version, locking some players out of the game. This has now been reactivated.

FIFA 22, if you haven't been keeping track, brought some solid improvements to the long-running football series when it launched last year, but its wins were, once again, overshadowed by what Eurogamer's Wesley Yin-Poole called its "morally bankrupt monetisation" in his review.


"I play a lot of FIFA, and with good reason," Wes wrote. "I enjoy it, in a grumpy sort of way. Reporting on all the good, bad and ugly FIFA has to offer has been a fascinating part of my job over the last decade. If you're only in it for Career Mode, for example, FIFA 22 is a good shout. If you only play Volta (there must be someone!) then there's nothing particularly offensive about the game. But context is king. Ultimate Team cannot be ignored."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has claimed Sony is working on a "pro" controller for PlayStation 5 that it's planning to officially unveil "soon".


That's according to the ever leaky Tom Henderson who, writing for Try Hard Guides (thanks VGC), claims to have seen images of a prototype from a source wishing to remain anonymous.


Henderson says the new controller retains the same basic style of the existing PlayStation 5 controller but features a number of key differences. These include "removable stick units" - which can be switched in and out using buttons below the analog sticks - plus trigger stops, a seemingly removal grip, and rear buttons that Henderson describes as "flappy paddles", presumably similar to those seen on the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its long-awaited official unveiling last week, Naughty Dog has given another glimpse of its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for PS5 and PC, this time showcasing what it calls a "glow up" for supporting character Tess.


During last week's Summer Game Fest reveal, one of key arguments Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann made for remaking the original Last of Us - a game that already got the remaster treatment in 2014 - was that the additional power of modern hardware would enable it to get closer to its "original vision". The studio specifically highlighted the remake's rebuilt character models and faces, which it said would better reflect the cast's original performances.


Inevitably, the remake's character changes have come as something of a shock to fans who've grown attached to the original versions over the last nine years, with both Joel and Ellie now sporting more realistic facial makeovers that age them notably. That's especially true for Naughty Dog's latest reveal, showcasing the new version of Joel's friend Tess, who initially agrees to help smuggle Ellie out of the city.

Yamagiwa previously worked at Sony's Japan Studio when it published Bloodborne, so understands the importance of balanced difficulty.


"Difficult games shouldn't be difficult just for the sake of it," Yamagiwa told IGN. "I think it's really important that this difficulty exists for the purpose of delivering a sense of accomplishment to the players once they have overcome it. That's why I think players should always be able to blame themselves when they die. The game has to be fair and its difficulty should never be unreasonable. In that regard, it works in my favour that I'm not very good at games myself. I'll always naturally be judging the fairness of games."

Included in this reel are clips of Jen Taylor mocapping her character of Cortana, as well as the evolution of the series' many digital environments. Taylor has famously voiced the role of Cortana throughout the Halo games, making her inclusion in the show a pretty special one for fans.
It is an interesting watch and, for those in the UK, one of our best looks at the show yet. You can check it out for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know Elden Ring is a tricky game and its optional boss battle against Malenia is arguably the most difficult moment of the game.


But one streamer, Kwitty23, decided to beat the whole game playing as Malenia. Not only that, he only used one move the entire run: her iconic Waterfowl Dance.


Funniest of all was when Kwitty23 ended up fighting Malenia as Malenia and proceeded to destroy her first time. Turns out she's pretty weak to her own attacks.

Senior concept artist Gervasio Canda has shared dozens of artworks over the past few years, which have garnered attention this week after fans began discussing one piece of art in particular. 


The following artwork is the only one in Canda's collection to depict a landscape that has not (to date) appeared in Fortnite. Are we looking into the future of the game? Or, perhaps more likely, is this an area Epic Games ended up not using?

This adaptation, which is set to release on 11th August 2023, will focus on the story of one teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills won them a series of Nissan competitions to become a professional race car driver. Deadline reports the screenplay has been written by Jason Hall.
If this all sounds familiar to you and you are getting a strong sense of déjà vu, well, you're right to feel that way. After all, this is the same concept from the Gran Turismo film that never was.

At the time of this announcement, Capcom revealed those yet to experience the games will be able to purchase the newly updated Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions from their respective stores, but existing owners on Xbox One and PS4 would be able to grab the updates relevant to their platform at no additional cost.
However, it now transpires this is not the case for those who got their hands on Resident Evil 7 through the PlayStation Plus Collection (something that is exclusive to the PS5).
Instead, those who have been playing the game via the PS Plus Collection but also want to experience the game with its 4K resolution, "high" framerates, ray tracing, and 3D audio will need to purchase the game separately (via IGN).

<blockquote><p>Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, however, have created a novel hardware attack, which combines memory corruption and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/new-flaw-in-intel-chips-lets-attackers-slip-their-own-data-into-secure-enclave/">speculative execution</a> attacks to sidestep the security feature. The attack shows that pointer authentication can be defeated without leaving a trace, and as it utilizes a hardware mechanism, no software patch can fix it.</p>
<p>The attack, appropriately called &#8220;Pacman,&#8221; works by &#8220;guessing&#8221; a pointer authentication code (PAC), a cryptographic signature that confirms that an app hasn’t been maliciously altered. This is done using speculative execution&#8212;a technique used by modern computer processors to speed up performance by speculatively guessing various lines of computation&#8212;to leak PAC verification results, while a hardware side-channel reveals whether or not the guess was correct...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

At the time, the developer said this delay was to ensure it delivers "the best possible experience" to players on its eventual launch. However, it has now been revealed that, as with other games, this delay was also due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
"We had a bit of a weird thing with the multiplayer because... part of our team is based out in the Ukraine... So, we had to delay the multiplayer because they had to move," The Quarry creative director Will Byles told IGN.
"We had to move the server from Kyiv up into Warsaw and those guys had to get out [of] there because it was obviously really dangerous."

Switch has faced widespread complaints around Joy-Con controller drift since its launch in 2017, leading to class action lawsuits, and even EU calls for an investigation into the issue after it received more than 25,000 complaints from numerous countries. Reports were significant enough that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologised for the issue in 2020, which it's since claimed to have "improved".


More recently, a Kotaku report claimed Nintendo of America recieved "thousands" of faulty Joy-Cons each week at height of drift issues, and now UK consumer watchdog Which? has shared its own findings into the severity of the problem, claiming two in five (40 percent) of Joy-Con controllers from the original Switch are affected.

In conversation with IGN, Howard revealed The Elder Scrolls 6 is currently in pre-production (confirming previous rumours around the project's progress), before adding, "And, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate's pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well."


In other words, with Bethesda's next big title, sci-fi RPG Starfield, delayed until next year, and still no word on a potential release window for The Elder Scrolls 6 - despite the game having received its first official tease back in 2018 - it sounds like there'll be an extremely long wait until Fallout 5 finally sees the light of day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard - which continues its attempts to reassert itself following many months of shocking allegations it fostered a company culture where sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive - has confirmed Overwatch 2's second closed beta will launch for PC and consoles on 28th June.


Blizzard first announced its intention to "decouple" Overwatch 2's PvP and PvE modes and begin a series of multiplayer-focused betas back in March, and the first of these took place in April. That initial run gave participants a first look at Overwatch 2's 5v5 gameplay, Push mode, four new maps, new hero Sojourn, and reworkings of Orisa, Doomfist, Bastion, and Sombra.


Round two, announced earlier today on Twitter, will shake things up a little further, giving players access to new tank hero Junker Queen and a new map. Blizzard is saving further details for a livestream airing this Thursday, 16th June, at 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PT, and says it'll be discussing the game's live-service model and seasonal content plan at the same time.

Asobo first targeted the US for a bit of a visual makeover in its second-ever World Update back in November 2020, introducing a significant number of improvements to the United States' multitudinous geological and man-made landmarks.
At the time, it said that the sheer size of the US meant it would eventually be revisiting the area, and now, seven World Updates later, that day has come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Microsoft shared a list of 50 new titles heading to Game Pass over the next 12 months, and it's now given a little more detail on one of those games - developer Iron Gate Studio's acclaimed viking survival hit Valheim - confirming it'll be launching for PC Game Pass this autumn with an Xbox release next spring.


Valheim, if you're unfamiliar, launched into Steam early access last February, and its refined viking survival action - which sees players exploring a gorgeous open-world, slowly preparing themselves to battle powerful creatures and prove themselves worthy of entering Valhalla - immediately drew critical acclaim.


It was also a massive sales hit too, managing to sell a staggering 4m copies in only three weeks. One year on, it's shifted over 10 million copies on PC, and development continues apace, with work on its highly anticipated Mistlands update said to be "well underway".

Fans can look forward to seeing "the last episode of the story of Eivor" via a final free chapter - which will presumably tell the story of how our Norse heroine came to rest in Vinland. 


Before then, there's a new Niflheim-set roguelite game mode named The Forgotten Saga coming this summer, and a final set of challenge vaults coming this autumn to conclude the game's Tombs of the Fallen mystery. And, of course, there's the game's seasonal festivals. All of this content comes for free.

Bowser remains the only member of Louarn's company Team Xecuter to be arrested, deported and now imprisoned in the US, for his part in the group's sale of console mod devices that allowed people to play pirated games. Louarn, a French citizen, meanwhile lives in Avignon and was recently interviewed by Le Monde (paywall), via TorrentFreak.


"I was't going to end up as an engineer earning €5k a month when I realized, at 18, that hacking was not just fun, but that there was a way to make a lot of money," Louarn says, of how he got into the hacking game. "Stealing from companies that make billions, what do I care?"

<blockquote><p>Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, quickly noticed something odd about the new feature: Not only did it allow the car to automatically start within 130 seconds of being unlocked with the NFC card, but it also put the car in a state to accept entirely new keys­with no authentication required and zero indication given by the in-car display.</p>
<p>&#8220;The authorization given in the 130-second interval is too general&#8230; [it&#8217;s] not only for drive,&#8221; Herfurt said in an online interview. &#8220;This timer has been introduced by Tesla… in order to make the use of the NFC card as a primary means of using the car more convenient. What should happen is that the car can be started and driven without the user having to use the key card a second time. The problem: within the 130-second period, not only the driving of the car is authorized, but also the [enrolling] of a new key.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactics Ogre: Reborn has leaked on to the PlayStation store, along with new artwork.

Back in April, Square Enix trademarked the name in Japan sparking rumours of a remake.


This leak suggests the remake is real, although a PSN listing that's since been removed (thanks Escapist) offers no gameplay or release date details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has played down reports that long-running Street Fighter character Fei Long can no longer appear in the famous fighting game franchise due to a clash with the Bruce Lee estate.


Fei Long, originally created for 1993's Super Street Fighter 2 as one of four new challengers, is heavily-inspired by real-life movie martial arts legend Bruce Lee.


Last month, Street Fighter 5 composer Daniel Lindholm suggested Fei Long may no longer feature in the series because the Lee Bruce estate insists depictions of the Enter the Dragon star must be "honourable", rather than humourous in the wake of the "comedy" cameo in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has slapped a new release window on Fallout 76's previously announced The Pitt expansion, confirming the Fallout-3-inspired update will arrive some time this September.


Fallout 76's The Pitt expansion was annouced for a 2022 release last June, and its arrival date was narrowed down a little further, specifically to this "autumn", as part of February's 2022 roadmap. Last night's Xbox showcase, though, saw it inching even closer to receiving a proper release date, with its new gameplay trailer heralding a September launch.


The Pitt - inspired by the second add-on released for 2008's much-loved Fallout 3 - will arrive as part of Fallout 76's Season 10 update in September, and marks the first time players will be able to travel beyond the boundaries of Appalachia in the online game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yesterday's big Starfield gameplay reveal, Bethesda has re-emerged with a few additional details regarding its highly anticipated sci-fi RPG, confirming that dialogue scenes will be presented in first-person throughout, and that the main character won't be voiced.


If you're only familiar with Bethesda games prior to Fallout 4, that probably won't seem like all that big a deal, given that mute protagonists and lengthy first-person conversations with dead-eyed NPCs were par for the course in Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, and Oblivion.


It's really only notable when you factor in Fallout 4; here, Bethesda opted for a slightly more cinematic approach to its story telling, switching to third-person perspective during dialogue scenes and introducing a fully voiced protagonist - the latter drawing complaints from fans that felt the decision had forced the developer to limit the breadth and depth of conversation options compared to those seen in previous games.

Since this news came to light, some have been voicing concerns that Diablo 4 may go down the same route as Diablo Immortal and have some kind of mobile-like monetisation and microtransactions attached to it. 
In response, several of its developers have swiftly jumped in to try and quell any anxiety within the Diablo community.
"To be clear, [Diablo 4] is a full price game built for PC/PS/Xbox audiences," franchise exec Rod Fergusson tweeted yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US launch of PlayStation Plus Premium has begun, and Sony has added many more titles to the service versus its previous rollout in parts of Asia.


This includes dozens more games for the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium's game catalogue of PS4 and PS5 titles, such as: Dead Cells, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Frostpunk: Console Edition, John Wick Hex, Little Nightmares, Nioh, Prey, Shenmue 3, Soulcalibur 6, Surgeon Simulator, Telling Lies, Tropico 5, Trine 4, plus The Dark Pictures Anthology's Little Hope and Man of Medan. 


The list of games available in the US looks to be a large upgrade from the list of games available in Hong Kong, for example. But there are some games (Journey to the Savage Planet) listed as available in Asia but not in the US.

Well, they've been answering some questions, while some other areas still remain bizarrely unclear. 


Crossplay has been a hope for the game since its reveal - something supported on Street Fighter 5 across PC and PlayStation, with Street Fighter 6 promising to bring Xbox players into the fold - and early reports from showgoers including fighting game YouTuber Maximillian Dood seemingly confirmed it would be included.


When pushed for clarity on the issue, however, Capcom was unwilling to confirm the matter. "In terms of crossplay we're going to have more information and more specifics to share down the line," a Capcom representative told Eurogamer at Summer Game Fest. "It's something we feel strongly about but in terms of actual specifics that will come at a later time."

Of course, Kojima most recently partnered with PlayStation for Death Stranding - and fans of that game are now expecting a Death Stranding sequel, thanks to the loose lips of actor and star Norman Reedus. 


Kojima's partnership with Sony was a major coup for PlayStation, and was announced with glee by its then-head Andy House. Kojima's appearance on last night's Microsoft and Bethesda Showcase, introduced by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, held similar vibes.

And not only did we get to see some more of this glorious gameplay in motion, we also got the news that its demo is now available to download on Steam.
The full game is slated to release sometime this year, although at the time of writing no further specifics were given.
Agent 64: Spies Never Die is all very James Bond GoldenEye a la the Nintendo 64 era, from the music and the weapons to the settings. There is even footage of the shooter - I assume the titular Agent 64 - finishing someone off in a toilet stall. Small me is very happy to see this and will most likely be heading to Steam to download the demo once I have finished work for the evening. You can check out the new trailer for yourself below.

Cloudpunk, which released back in 2020, was an experience I enjoyed a lot after it received a number of much-needed post-launch nips and tucks, revelling in the chance to play out all my Blade Runner fantasies by careening around its stunningly designed, neon-drenched futuristic city of Nivalis in my trusty flying car.


The biggest disappointment was that Nivalis proved to be rather lifeless at ground level, which is where Cloudpunk's spin-off comes in, attempting to turn the city from a pretty backdrop into a rich, meaningful world of its own as you attempt to build a business up from scratch.

Unfortunately, it's early days as far as specifics go, with the bulk of 11 Bit's reveal taking the form of a cinematic trailer - one immediately bringing Duncan Jones' celebrated sci-fi movie Moon to mind. You see, in The Alters, players take on the role of Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant planet, ensconced in a roving wheel-like base, with a bunch of alternative versions of himself known as Alters. Ultimately, the goal is to stay alive long enough to find a way back home by creating new Alters, each of who have different skills essential for survival.


"The Alters is a game about life-changing moments," explains The Alters' new Steam page. "Those binary decisions that happen in nanoseconds, but have influence over your entire life. It is about looking into yourself, into your past, and discovering that you are who you are as a sum of those numerous choices. And when you do that a fundamental question arises: WHAT IF...?".

They'd also start each session within the Legendary Hideout, blasting through its waterfall to make a grand entrance on the main map.


Unfortunately, following Sea of Thieves' rocky launch, Rare announced it would be placing the Captaincy update "on the back burner" while it refocussed its development. Since then, the Captaincy update has become the stuff of legends itself, many assuming it was lost to time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you like mournfully hopping around a mysterious world as a little person solving puzzles, you might like the sound of Cocoon: it's a deeply handsome puzzle-platforming indie from Jeppe Carlsen, the gameplay designer of Limbo and Inside.
You play as a kind of fly-person, who carries various glowing spheres around various exotic worlds. It's wonderfully moody, the opening desert hinting at some Sable-like vibes before we move on to a range of other ones, "worlds within worlds" as the blurb puts it. Even from just the trailer you get the sense there's some real cleverness to the puzzle-platforming to go with it.
Looks good! You can "unravel a cosmic mystery" in it next year, as it's coming 2023, like an awful lot of games it seems, on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield's delay was some of the biggest news to come this year, but alas not a surprise. After all, we had only been shown concept art with every teaser so far. Thankfully though, we now have our first look at some actual gameplay.
The gameplay starts off on the mysterious moon of Kreet and sees robot companion VASCO making his way out of the starship. Then, of course, we see some aliens, other space things and some combat. All the while, the swelling score is ticking along nicely in the background. We also pop over to New Atlantis at one point.
But you're not here to listen to me waffling on. You're here to see it for yourself. So, without further ado, here is our first look at gameplay for Starfield.

Details were thin on the ground - really, there was nothing here which had not been reported already - but tonight Microsoft made it official. 


Kojima is working on a brand new project with Xbox which will harness the company's cloud technology. If this sounds familiar, well, it's a promise we've heard before, and a detail which first found its way online last summer, when whispers of Kojima working with Microsoft first hit the internet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We didn't see this one coming: renowned role-playing game developer Obsidian is releasing a brand new game called Pentiment this November on Xbox consoles, PC and the cloud.
It's a narrative-focused murder mystery set in medieval times, and the action takes place on the pages of an era-appropriate book. It certainly looks different to everything else out there.
The game is led by Obsidian star director Josh Sawyer (Fallout: new Vegas, Pillars of Eternity) and is apparently an idea he pitched years and years ago at Black Isle Studios, according to IGN, which interviewed Sawyer about his new game.

Grounded has been available in early access for PC and Xbox since July 2020, miniaturising players - in true Honey, I Shrunk the Kids fashion - down to bug height and sending them off on an 80s-themed survival adventure through an ordinary backyard.


There's building, crafting, spiders the size of trucks (at least from your miniaturised perspective), and a whole lot more to experience as you - along with a couple of friends if you like - fight to find a way to return to human size.

Think snow-capped Pyramids, steampunk future-cities, and blimps, of course, because who doesn't love a good blimp.

Still, it looks intriguing and if it's half as fun as Mojang's Minecraft Dungeons, will be worth a try. As you'd expect, it's coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and will launch for PC via Windows Store and Steam, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft showed a new trailer for A Plage Tale: Requiem during the Games Showcase today, giving us another rare look at gameplay in the upcoming sequel, due sometime this year on Xbox Consoles, PC and Game Pass at launch. It's also coming to PS5 but obviously Microsoft glossed over that bit.
The thing that really stuck out to me, a fan of the first game, was stabbing. Amicia, the returning older sister of brother Hugo, and our hero, can now approach enemies from the back and stealth-kill them, reaching over and stabbing them multiple times in the neck - the kind of gruesome move we've seen many times in other stealth combat games. Except A Plague Tale, the first game, wasn't really a stealth combat game - it was more about running away and hiding and being smart. That's what made it stand out. 
Amicia also packs a crossbow in the sequel, which she uses, and she can garrotte people with some chord. All she had in the first game was a slingshot, which wasn't entirely capable of one-shot kills. It was more of a utility/distraction tool.

Microsoft hasn't revealed how the Pelican will fit into the overall Flight Simulator experience just yet, but you can get a gimpse of the ship in the trailer below. It's a different story for the free 40th Anniversary Edition update, however, which has been detailed in significantly more detail.
Described as a "comprehensive celebration of the franchise", it promises to pay tribute to the series' past as well as introduce new aircraft types. The latter additions include the long-awaited arrival of helicopters and gliders, brought to life with a new Fluid Dynamics Simulation.

As well as this, Forza Motorsport will also be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass subscription service on day one.
Along with this announcement, Dan Greenawalt and the game's director Chris Esaki popped in for a chat about their game. It's the most technically advanced racing game ever apparently, so that's exciting. We also got told about its dynamic time of day feature, the weather for each track and the inclusion of raytracing. This was all shown off with a clip from the fictional circuit known as Maple Valley.
The twosome also says there's a 48x improvement in the accuracy of the simulation - but, as Martin has asked, what does that mean, and how does it feel? I guess we won't find out for a while.

Redfall's the work of Arkane Austin, and today's overview mixed up a bit of gameplay with a look at the playable characters. We start approaching a spooky church and then head up into the spire where vampires are leaping about. Shotguns and nice vampire-burning-up effects ensue, and then we're off to learn a bit about the town.


The titular Redfall is an island community in Massachusets apparently, but now the whole place has gone to heck. Vampires have blocked out the sun, drained all the water, and cut the town off. (Wouldn't draining the water do the opposite?) Expect spooky Americana, like a funfair and an old cinema which appears to have the wilderness growing inside. Expect Left 4 Dead-type action as you take on different enemy types.

Castlevania: Nocturne will follow the adventures of two characters that should be immediately familiar to fans of the video games - Richter Belmont (a distant descendant of original Netflix series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - with its vampiric action playing out against the backdrop of the French Revolution, circa 1792.


 Powerhouse, the studio behind Netflix's original animated Castlevania series will once again be on animation duties for Nocturne, with Kevin Kolde serving as showrunner and Clive Bradley being credited as "creator/writer".

Season one of The Cuphead Show was well-received when it launched earlier this year, proving to be a hugely enjoyable adaptation of Studio MDHR's acclaimed run-and-gunner. Cuphead's second season will, unsurprisingly, continues where its predecessor left often, featuring the further misadventures of Cuphead, Mugman, and friends on Inkwell Isle.
Season 2 will feature another 12 15-minute episodes, and a further 12 episodes will follow sometime after that, completing Netflix's previously confirmed three-season, 36 episode run.

How's it all been so far? Well, the PlayStation State of Play was pretty good, actually.


As for Geoff Keighley's show last night, well... there were plenty of announcements in last night's showcase, though few genuine surprises. Here we share our favourites, rate the night overall, and provide our best impressions of the Clickers from The Last of Us. Joining me, as ever, are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.


Of course, this year has seen the traditional E3 model splintered further - and we're still to see two platform holders take their turn in the spotlight. We'll be back next week to break down the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase, plus  perhaps even a Nintendo Direct. Thanks for watching, and have a lovely weekend!

As well as the monthly event's typical in-game bonuses and good chances at catching a Deino's Shiny version, developer Niantic is also using the event to roll-out a couple of brand new features. 


In a twist, players will be able to extend the event's three-hour runtime in their local area by raiding at gyms after the 11am-2pm window concludes. The raids will feature Deino's evolved form Zweilous, and hatch from a new type of raid egg that can only be tackled by players in person (so, no remote raid passes!).

Ahead of this reveal, we also got our first look at the price - $70 - via a leak online. That in itself was enough to cause many to raise an eyebrow, as while the game certainly does look smoother thanks to its current gen make-over, it is also a game that has been released twice before.
Today, we now have even more information on this release, such as the three editions that will be released. And I am sorry to say this folks, but that £70/$70 will only get you the base game and its prequel Left Behind. If you want to get your hands on the The Last of Us Part 1's  Digital Deluxe edition, you are going to have to part ways with £80/$80. Meanwhile, if you are looking to purchase The Last of Us Part I Firefly Edition, which is only available to buy as an exclusive directly from PlayStation in the US, you are looking at just shy of $100.
So, what exactly do you get with these editions to make them worth the money?

Indeed, those that stuck around once Keighley had done his thing this evening would have immediately been greeted by a slew of intriguing new indie titles, courtesy of this year's Day of the Devs showcase - and if you missed it, the whole thing can be perused in one convenient, easily digestible round-up below. 

Time Flies


Time Flies is the work of Michael Frei and Mario von Rickenbach, the developers behind the acclaimed Kids, and explores the limited time we have on Earth from the perspective of a fly. After entering your location, you're allotted a set amount of time (based on your country's average life expectancy) to explore the inside of a house and puzzle out ways to complete a bucket list of activities, ranging from getting rich to making a friend. Time Flies is coming to Playstation, Switch, PC, and Mac next year.

For the curious, Darktide is a spiritual follow-up to Fatshark's previous four-player co-op games, Warhammer: Vermintide and Vermintide 2, which are a bit like medieval Left 4 Deads but with giant rats. This one's set in the even grimmer and darker universe of the year 40K.
And it's all quite supremely 40K, by the looks of things. We get a nice glimpse of the four classes - Psyker, Veteran, Zealot, Ogryn - blowing apart the hordes of cultists-cum-space-zombies in different ways.

Baker and Johnson, who play Joel and Ellie in Naughty Dog's games, took to the stage during Summer Game Fest alongside The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann.

You will have access to all of the game's Boss customisation options, bar special progression-locked items (so yes, you can play around with those modesty emojis to your heart's content).

This multiplayer will have its own storyline and it takes place in another part of the United States. Is that the Golden Gate Bridge we can see over there? Hmm. Why, yes. Yes, I think it is.

Layers of Fears, to give the new experience its official (and faintly ridiculous) name, has been co-developed with Anshar Studios, and sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 to form what Bloober is calling a "psychological horror chronicle" - complete with new visuals, gameplay, and expanded plot lines.


Bloober says these new story elements will "cast a new light on the overarching narrative" as players face "spine-chilling madness that extends over generations."

American Arcadia, which was initially teased earlier this year, takes place in a retro-futuristic metropolis where the citizens have no idea they're actually contestants on the most watched reality show on the planet.


What follows is a daring escape - presented as a documentary, complete with interviews and police interrogations - as players take control of two different characters in two different locations, each with their own playstyles.

It is a colourful and playfully chunky looking strategy game, but one with a somber undertone.

It also features a city called Alphaville, so yes, while I am writing this up, I am also singing Big in Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashback, the Delphine platformer from 1992, has a sequel on the way. It's called Flashback 2, but the 2 is very small so it looks sciencey.


We've known about this for a while, but we've just got a proper glimpse of the game  at Geoff's Summer Games Fest thing. I say proper glimpse -  the trailer's stylish but tricky to read too much into. There's lots of mantling and side-on platforming and the suggestion that physics and big robots both play a part, so that's all okay with us.


Flashback 2 will be out this Winter on all the consoles and PC by the looks of it. Microids is in charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight brought a look at a gameplay mission from Infinity Ward's upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, as part of the Geoff Keighley-fronted Summer Game Fest.


If you're not up to date, this is the sequel to the 2019 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which rebooted the series and re-imagined some of its popular characters.


Here we find them boarding a ship and getting into all sorts of shooty business. There's a bit of that fancy water which Wes reported on in his earlier look at the game, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Its Summer Game Fest time, and things have been kicked off with a trip into outer space. Yes, we have our first look at Dead Space 4. Sorry, I mean The Callisto Protocol (easy mistake to make).
As you would expect, it is a bloody horror filled rampage against some pretty ugly looking fellas. I am talking limbs coming off left, right and centre. There is also a look at a gravity gun in use, and our protagonist stomping down on a felled enemy's corpse (because you just would if that thing came at you!). 
We also get to see, erm, well, someone getting trapped in a fan of sorts, resulting in them getting mushed up. To sum up, it's unpleasant, clausterphobic and, won't lie, I'm here for it. See what you think for yourself below.

Coming from developer Tindalos Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment, Aliens: Dark Descent is described as a "squad-based, single-player action game" that sees players commanded their soldiers in real-time as they take on Xenomorphs - including Facehuggers, Praetorians, and Alien Queens - as well as rogue operatives from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.


"Infiltrate large open levels and annihilate enemies with your squad, dispatching orders strategically and intuitively at the touch of a button," the game's newly launched Steam page explains. "Tread carefully, as your foes will adapt their tactics to your actions while hunting you down because death is permanent. Forge unique paths for survival, uncovering shortcuts, creating safe zones, and setting up motion trackers in a persistent world where your actions impact levels forever."

Moss: Book 2, which picks up immediately after the events of the first game, once again builds its action around a hybrid of first-person and third-person perspectives as players, in the role of an omniscient spirit, help guide mouse protagonist Quill on her quest to free the land from the clutches of the evil Arcane.


Polyarc's sequel initially launched for PSVR earlier this year, and Eurogamer's resident virtual reality aficionado Ian Higton was delighted to revisit the series' cinematic blend of puzzling and combat in his glowing Moss: Book 2 review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of tonight's Summer Game Fest, Sony's The Last of Us Part 1 remake - one of the worst kept secrets in the industry today - has leaked. So yes, it is real. And not only is it really real, but it will also be releasing as soon as 2nd September for the PlayStation 5 at a retail price of $70. 
To accompany this news, we got our first look at the remake in action thanks to a brand-new trailer. You can check it out for yourself by following this link.
As you can see, the Ellie and Joel that we first met all the way back in 2013 now have a much sleeker look, but it is most certainly still them. There is fighting, there is compassion, and there are enough clickers to give one spores for thought throughout this reveal. Rather nicely, the game's DLC - Left Behind - will also be included in this remake.

And now it's out! Available to play on itch.io, the game offers a miniature green-tinged version of the Lands Between - or at least, the Precipice of Anticipation, Northern Limgrave, and Stormveil Castle - presented in a Zelda-inspired top-down fashion.


The game runs in-browser, but Shin recommends using real Game Boy hardware or an Analogue Pocket for saving, better colours, and higher accuracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you think of CD Projekt Red and the word Cyberpunk together, you do get a certain thought in your head. Yes, we all get visions of that disastrous launch. However, this could all be about to change, as a new trailer and some bonus footage from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime has been revealed, and it looks pretty damn amazing in my eyes. 
The trailer, via Netflix, doesn't give much away in terms of story beats, but it certainly sets the scene. There is neon, there is angst, there are explostions and gunfire a plenty and, oh yes, there are motorbikes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With last night's trailer reveal for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, fans of Activision's largest franchise were left with sour taste after discovering the publisher has raised the price of last-gen versions of the game. 


Pre-ordering the game for either PlayStation 4 or Xbox One will cost players £69.99. That's a hefty £10 increase from the asking for price for the franchise's last title: Vanguard. 


The price rise is explained by the fact players are now forced to purchase the "Cross-Gen Bundle," which includes both the last-gen and current-gen versions of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report into the development of Bethesda's widely derided Fallout 76 has painted a picture of a studio in disarray, as poor management, a lack of design direction, and engine challenges created an environment of apathy, confusion, crunch, and burnout, and a game that ultimately failed to resonate with players.


Announced in 2018 and launched the following year, Fallout 76 - an online take on Bethesda's beloved post-apocalyptic RPG series - was less than well-received at launch. Eurogamer's Wesley Yin-Poole even went as far as to call it a "bizarre, boring, broken mess" before slapping it with an avoid badge.


Now, a lengthy new report from Kotaku - based on conversations with 10 former employees of Bethesda and parent company ZeniMax Media - has shed fresh light on the troubled development that lead to such a poorly received game, one seemingly doomed from the start.

Word that Battlefield 2042's post-launch development has been dramatically downscaled was first shared by journalist Jeff Grubb on his Grubbsnax Giant Bomb show, where he claimed the remaining team has been tasked with delivering the four seasons of live service content promised to purchasers the "fastest and the cheapest it possibly can".


"This game is basically down to a skeleton crew," Grubb told viewers (thanks VGC). "It's down to like the bare bones and those people are specifically just working on the promised additional seasons that the game needs to meet the requirements of the high-end version that it sold."
