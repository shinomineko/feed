A now annual tradition, the news quiz sees us look back at some of the year's more oddball news headlines and argue over who deserves the most points for remembering them. From 50 Cent to Heinz ketchup to a video game breaking the Geneva Convention - 2023 has had it all. But do you remember why?


Play along at home as we set Eurogamer's news elves - Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan - 23 questions looking back over 2023. Good luck to you all - and a very happy new year!

<blockquote><p>To test PIGEON&#8217;s performance, I gave it five personal photos from a trip I took across America years ago, none of which have been published online. Some photos were snapped in cities, but a few were taken in places nowhere near roads or other easily recognizable landmarks.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t seem to matter much.</p>
<p>It guessed a campsite in Yellowstone to within around 35 miles of the actual location. The program placed another photo, taken on a street in San Francisco, to within a few city blocks.</p>
<p>Not every photo was an easy match: The program mistakenly linked one photo taken on the front range of Wyoming to a spot along the front range of Colorado, more than a hundred miles away. And it guessed that a picture of the Snake River Canyon in Idaho was of the Kawarau Gorge in New Zealand (in fairness, the two landscapes look remarkably similar)...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>When Stolen Device Protection is turned on, Face ID or Touch ID authentication is required for additional actions, including viewing passwords or passkeys stored in iCloud Keychain, applying for a new Apple Card, turning off Lost Mode, erasing all content and settings, using payment methods saved in Safari, and more. No passcode fallback is available in the event that the user is unable to complete Face ID or Touch ID authentication.</p>
<p>For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple said there will be no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Despite being "content-complete", the team says that as some members "come from a region affected by conflict", timescales have slipped and the mod has not been tested as thoroughly as hoped. Consequently, the release has been pushed back to allow for more testing time. 

"Despite being content-complete as planned, upon careful consideration, we've recognised that our testing process may not be as robust as we desire," the team said in a statement posted to social media.

"I, for a long time, have been a person who has bemoaned the direction God of War went somewhat, and have yearned for the hack-and-slash OG God of War games. I just love them so much", Baker said (thanks, GGRecon).

The announcement that Sega was working on new entries in the above series came as something of a suprise this month, and with few other details. 


Now, we know just a little more about each of the projects, and have a first glimpse at how they'll presumably look.

The PlayStation studio had stayed silent until now, something it said was a result of it being "focused inward" to support team members. Personal data was included in the breach, Insomniac confirmed, but the studio is still "working quickly" to examine the impact.


On the spread of stolen material relating to Marvel's Wolverine and other, upcoming game projects, Insomniac said it would share information "when the time was right".

A statement posted this morning to X, formerly Twitter, gave remaining players a month's notice that the game - once Steam's most-wishlisted title - would close down in just over 30 days.


As a reminder, The Day Before only launched in early access on 7th December. This means its servers will only have been active for 48 days total - even shorter than Liz Truss' tenure as PM.

News of the limits wiped a combined ~$80bn from the value of Tencent and NetEase, China's two main games publishers that now support or part-own many of the world's biggest games companies.


Chinese online video games will now no longer be able to offer an extra incentive to spend in a game for the first time, or for spending repeatedly, Reuters reported.

It's remarkable to see an in-development game being played in this way - and I can't think of a similar situation, at least in recent memory. The GTA 6 hack contained a mountain of development assets, yes, but nothing playable in this manner. 


Here, people have been able to access a test build of Wolverine akin to an internal demo meant for Insomniac and Sony, that features multiple sections of the game available to play and explore. Naturally, these sections are still incomplete and unpolished, but key gameplay mechanics and story moments are included.

Known as Tastes of the Seven Tribes, this book will allow you to whip up a batch of spicy Fireclaw stew or even some Bitterbrew Boar (which is described as "mouth-watering"). 


It's coming from Insight Editions, Rick Barba and prolific recipe writer Victoria Rosenthal, whose name you may recognise from a myriad of other video game related cookery books such as God of War's Official Cookbook of the Nine Realms and the Donlan-approved Destiny cookbook.

The subtle changes were noticed two days ago on 19th December, when Epic announced two games, Gods Unchained and Striker Manager 3, have been relisted on its storefront. Both games were removed from the store after they received an Adults Only rating from the ESRB in the USA.
Previously, Epic banned all games with an Adults Only rating from its store but has openly welcomed blockchain games. In order to allow Gods Unchained and Striker Manager 3 back onto its store, Epic has tweaked its policies on prohibited content.

On 11th December, one user posted training material for the Norinco VT-4 tank (as reported by Cyber Daily). On 12th December, a user posted a manual for the M2A2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle (as reported by Task and Purpose).

Kotick's reign lasted 32 years, during which time the company became one of the biggest and most influential video games publishers on the planet. 


His departure this month is not unexpected - Activision Blizzard had previously confirmed Kotick's presence only until the end of this year to "ensure a smooth and seamless integration" following  Microsoft's long-winded but ultimately successful $68.7bn acquisition. Now, we know exactly when Kotick leaves and how the company will be shaped without him.

On behalf of the Structured Logging Working Group
and SIG Instrumentation,
we are pleased to announce that the contextual logging feature
introduced in Kubernetes v1.24 has now been successfully migrated to
two components (kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager)
as well as some directories. This feature aims to provide more useful logs
for better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers to enhance Kubernetes.
What is contextual logging?
Contextual logging
is based on the go-logr API.
The key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller
and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger.
The binary decides the logging implementation, not the libraries.

The game is currently codenamed R and is planned for an official reveal in 2025, according to Bloober's press release about the partnership (in Polish).

Skybound is most known for the comic series The Walking Dead, which was created by Skybound co-founder Robert Kirkman in 2010. Skybound established its subsidiary Skybound Games in 2018 to publish and license video games.

Sony announced the milestone today, and said PS5 had passed the 50m mark earlier this month, on 9th December. 


That means PS5 took 160 weeks and 2 days to reach the 50m milestone - just one week longer than PS4, despite severe sales constraints for much of its early lifecycle.

This page has raised some eyebrows, however, as the game is listed there as "The Suika Game" and not "Suika Game". The game's original developer is also not mentioned.


The original Suika Game was developed by Aladdin X and, so far, it has only been released on the Nintendo eShop, though many browser versions and clones on other platforms have since popped up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioWare and Mass Effect veteran Mac Walters has discussed his reasons for departing the studio after 19 years to begin work with a fresh team on a new sci-fi franchise.


In an interview with MinnMax, Walters detailed the various factors involved in his departure, from the desire to work on something brand new and not feeling able to within BioWare or EA, to the positive experience of working on the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition trilogy remaster with a small and "scrappy" team acting as a reminder of his early days at the studio and serving as a positive moment to make his exit.


Discussing the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition project, Walters described its approval by EA as something relatively "unplanned", compared to the careful assignment of teams long in advance to work on the studio's typical fare: mammoth big budget RPGs. This led to a different way of working which brought back fond memories, he said.

Frostbite was originally developed by DICE for use in its Battlefield series, and has since been adopted internally at other studios also owned by its parent company EA.
Historically, the engine was used by BioWare to develop Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem to mixed reception on technical performance. Recently, it was used in this year's Dead Space remake and EA's numerous annual sports franchises.

This blog discusses a new feature in Kubernetes 1.29 to improve the handling of taint-based pod eviction.
Background
In Kubernetes 1.29, an improvement has been introduced to enhance the taint-based pod eviction handling on nodes.
This blog discusses the changes made to node-lifecycle-controller
to separate its responsibilities and improve overall code maintainability.
Summary of changes
node-lifecycle-controller previously combined two independent functions:
Adding a pre-defined set of NoExecute taints to Node based on Node's condition.
Performing pod eviction on NoExecute taint.
With the Kubernetes 1.29 release, the taint-based eviction implementation has been
moved out of node-lifecycle-controller into a separate and independent compone…]]></summary>

With the recent release of Kubernetes 1.29, the PodReadyToStartContainers
condition is
available by default.
The kubelet manages the value for that condition throughout a Pod's lifecycle,
in the status field of a Pod. The kubelet will use the PodReadyToStartContainers
condition to accurately surface the initialization state of a Pod,
from the perspective of Pod sandbox creation and network configuration by a container runtime.
What's the motivation for this feature?
Cluster administrators did not have a clear and easily accessible way to view the completion of Pod's sandbox creation
and initialization. As of 1.28, the Initialized condition in Pods tracks the execution of init containers.
However, it has limitations in accurately re…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data scraped from the servers for Apple's TestFlight service circa 2012 to 2015 have been leaked, giving access to tens of thousands of iOS apps and games.
The leak has been dubbed the "teraleak" due to its sheer size and seemingly as a nod to the Nintendo "gigaleak" from 2020 which included prototypes of Star Fox 2 and Yoshi's Island, cut content from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, and more.
TestFlight is a service for developers to release iOS apps for testing. Files on Apple's servers were found archived via Wayback Machine and then shared anonymously to X (née Twitter). Links to the archives can be found quite easily by entering "TestFlight leak" into your chosen search engine.

The patent features algorithms that would be able to finely tune difficulty settings based on an individual's performance. It is interesting to see Sony patent such an idea, when similar processes are used in other games already. 


Regardless, this patent (which can be viewed via World Intellectual Property Organization), shows PlayStation has its eye on the future of this sort of technology.

The move follows the ongoing investigations into The Open Hand Foundation, a fundraising body created by Khalil's family.
Sabotage and Khalil had a close working relationship, with Khalil consistently giving the studio a spot in IndieLand, an annual charity stream to support The Open Hand Foundation, and supporting Sea of Stars on Kickstarter. Sabotage created specific content for use in IndieLand, and eventually added Khalil as an NPC called Jirard the Constructionist in the release version of Sea of Stars. 
But now there are allegations Khalil committed charity fraud through The Open Hand Foundation, via YouTubers Mutahar "SomeOrdinaryGamers" Anas and Karl Jobst. Following further investigations, and responses from Khalil, Anas, and Jobst, Sabotage has now replaced Jirard the Constructionist in a new Sea of Stars patch.

"Originally it was a Fortnite clone. Nobody wanted that really, not even us, but we didn't have much of a choice for a long time," the developer told fan wiki The Free Radical Archive.

This blog introduces a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.29.
It provides a configurable approach to define how Service implementations,
exemplified in this blog by kube-proxy,
handle traffic from pods to the Service, within the cluster.
Background
In older Kubernetes releases, the kube-proxy would intercept traffic that was destined for the IP
address associated with a Service of type: LoadBalancer. This happened whatever mode you used
for kube-proxy.
The interception implemented the expected behavior (traffic eventually reaching the expected
endpoints behind the Service). The mechanism to make that work depended on the mode for kube-proxy;
on Linux, kube-proxy in iptables mode would redirecting packets directly to the endpoint; in ipvs mode,
kube-proxy would configure t…]]></summary>

With the release of Kubernetes v1.29, the ReadWriteOncePod volume access mode
has graduated to general availability: it's part of Kubernetes' stable API. In
this blog post, I'll take a closer look at this access mode and what it does.
What is ReadWriteOncePod?
ReadWriteOncePod is an access mode for
PersistentVolumes (PVs)
and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
introduced in Kubernetes v1.22. This access mode enables you to restrict volume
access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to
the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads
that require single-writer access to storage.

The team stopped short of revealing when it would withdraw the games, but did assure current owners that "existing players can continue to enjoy these games without interruption".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poppy Playtime – the horror mascot game that's been scaring the bejesus out of us for the last couple of years now – is finally making the jump to consoles.

Chapter 1: A Tight Squeeze – which was first released on PC back in 2021 – is set to debut on PS4 and PS5 on 20th December, and on Switch on 25th December. Presumably, because there's no better time to release a terrifying horror game on a family-favourite console than Christmas Day.

You can wishlist the PlayStation-flavoured version now, or pre-order on Switch from 18th December.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tencent has reportedly shut down Team Kaiju, a subsidiary of TiMi Studio Group.

Although the closure has yet to be formally announced, a LinkedIn post from an alleged former employee there reveals that the official website, kaiju.gg, now only loads a 404 page, and the studio's former LinkedIn listing now leads to a "this LinkedIn Page isn't available" error.

"Team Kaiju doesn't appear to exist anymore," the developer noted. "No announcement from Tencent. Most of the folks there were amazing. I wish them the best for the future."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is one of the year's best releases as far as I'm concerned, but its arrival was bittersweet, given developer Mimimi Games announced it was shutting up shop shortly after. Since then, the team has wrapped up work on two final DLC drops introducing new characters, islands, and more - but it turns out that wasn't quite everything it had in store: in a surprise final update, Mimimi has now launched an expansive "modding tool" for PC.


Shadow Gambit launched back in August, and saw Mimimi revisiting its beloved stealth-tactics genre - which it'd already bought to life with impressive flair in Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperatdos 3 - with an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. The result, as I wrote in my four star review was a blend of "raucous, high seas adventure and cerebral, slow-paced stealth" that proved to be a "joyous mastery of a very particular form".


Shortly after its release, Mimimi announced Shadow Gambit would be the studio's last project, as its "increasingly ambitious games" had taken a "heavy personal toll on us and our families". Two final DLC releases for Shadow Gambit were to bring the studio's activities to a close, but it's now surprised fans with a "very final parting gift": an expansive "modding tool" designed to enable players to create their own custom mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve's making a list, and checking it twice; it's gonna find out who's naughty and nice. And if you happen to be on its Naughty List - which pretty much applies to any one of the "thousands" of DOTA 2 players now identified as being dirty, filthy cheaters - you can expect a cheerfully gift-wrapped lump of toxic coal and a permanent ban in your stocking as your festive treat for 2023.


DOTA 2's annual Frostivus celebrations are now officially underway, meaning everyone on Valve's Nice List - as per its Frostivus 2023 update announcement - can look forward to various festive treats and quality of life improvements. It's less of a jolly holiday for those who've been placed on Valve's Naughty List, however: King Kringle is now doing the rounds with his ban hammer to "pulverise the smurf accounts of all the naughty boys and girls, before handing out penalties to their associated main accounts."


Following Valve's brutal culling of over 90,000 smurf accounts back in September, the company says it's "continued to invest in player behaviour monitoring" and will be handing out still punishments for smurf accounts and other "questionable choices", including "bad actors...playing like jerks, ruining games and losing behaviour score because of it, then hiring behaviour score farmers to drive it back up."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can you believe it's already been over four hundred years since Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was announced? And while this year's Game Awards failed to make the interminable wait any easier with a first trailer or some small morsel of news for fans, we might finally have something resembling a potential release window - courtesy of a retailer leak, by way of an official Bandai Namco partner, pointing to a February 2024 launch for the DLC.


As spotted over on Reddit, details of a new Elden Ring collaboration between publisher Bandai Namco and peripheral manufacturer Thrustmaster - one that'll apparently see the latter release a series of limited edition controllers themed around the game - were today shared, briefly and presumably mistakenly, by online retailer Datablitz.


Notably, the accompanying promotional material revealed the first batch of controllers would arrive in February next year to "sync with the new Shadow of the Erdtree expansion release". It's a launch window that seems highly unlikely at first glance, not least because it's barely two months from now with no peep of marketing from Bandai Namco - but on the other hand, who's to say that if I wish for something hard enough I can't make it happen? Plus, a surprise second anniversary launch would be in keeping with the amusingly understated way the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was announced in the first place.

In a new interview with IGN, the Bayonetta creator discussed his reasoning for leaving the developer.



"My work with PlatinumGames was based on a relationship of trust with the company," he said. "I decided to leave because I felt that the direction the company was heading in was different from my beliefs as a developer. Without that element of trust, I couldn't continue working there, and so I left, so that I could continue working in what I consider to be the right way."

The exhibition will be laid out as a memorial space, with pictures of the dead characters and their last words put up onto the walls. Visitors will be given flowers to place at the portrait of their favourite dead character, before arriving at a cenotaph with an AR "gimmick" which sounds like the character will appear on your phone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 will not be coming to Game Pass, even now the game is available on Xbox. 


Speaking with IGN, Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke stated the award winning RPG won't appear on Microsoft's subscription service, and that has always been the plan. 


"We made a big game, so I think there's a fair price to be paid for that, and I think that that is okay," Vincke said, adding Baldur's Gate 3's inclusion on Game Pass was a "sensitive question".

Celestial featured in the credits of the base game, while Toby Fox - known as the creator of Undertale - composed music for the soundtrack, specifically the raid battle theme among others.


The remix is a stripped back, string-heavy affair that chops up the vocal lines - it's a pleasant change from the original.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane Lyon has shared new concept art for its upcoming video game, Marvel's Blade.

The artwork gives our first glimpse of the game's vampire enemies.

It looks incredibly good, and hopefully this will carry over into the game's release. For want of a better word, it looks really, really cool, and has echoes of the studio's previous works Deathloop and Dishonored (at this point, it is worth noting that Arkane's previous vampire game Redfall was primarily helmed by its Austin department).

The port, known as Link's Awakening DX HD, was a rather gorgeous remake of the classic Zelda GameBoy title. It featured HD visuals, 120fps scrolling and widescreen support. 


As noted by Digital Foundry's John Linneman, it also allowed players to zoom out and take in the entirety of Koholint Island at once.

The mechanic was revealed last week in a new trailer for The Indigo Disk. Now it's been released, players have been experimenting with what they can and can't do as their caught Pokémon.
As a sidenote, performance in The Indigo Disk is still bad, as Lewchube on X (née Twitter) discovered, and in some cases even worse than the base game.

The Shadows of Change DLC for Total War: Warhammer 3 was poorly received by players when it released in August, with mostly negative reviews on Steam posted ever since. Total War: Pharaoh, meanwhile, was criticised for its high price and lack of content.


"We again apologise for the missteps we've made," reads a new blog post from Creative Assembly vice president Roger Collum. "The mistakes of Total War are a shared responsibility by all the leaders of the franchise, and while it may not seem like it at times, we are listening."

Naughty Dog's multiplayer game was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but the studio announced it was separating the two halves in 2019. After years of relative silence on its progress, studio co-head Neil Druckmann emerged in January to confirm more would be revealed "later this year" - but instead, May brought the news the project needed "more time".


Shortly after, a report from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claimed Destiny developer Bungie - which had been individually assessing many of Sony's "games as a service" projects since being acquired by the company - had raised concerns about The Last of Us multiplayer's "ability to keep players engaged for a long period of time", resulting in Sony scaling back the team to just a "small group" while it evaluated the project's direction.

The v1.29 release of Kubernetes introduced an alpha feature to support modifying a volume

With the feature enabled, Kubernetes can handle updates of volume attributes other than capacity.
Allowing volume attributes to be changed without managing it through different
provider's APIs directly simplifies the current flow.

or you can read on to learn about why the Kubernetes project is supporting this feature.

For Kubernetes v1.29, you need to use additional components to integrate your
Kubernetes cluster with a cloud infrastructure provider. By default, Kubernetes
v1.29 components abort if you try to specify integration with any cloud provider using
one of the legacy compiled-in cloud provider integrations. If you want to use a legacy
integration, you have to opt back in - and a future release will remove even that option.
In 2018, the Kubernetes community agreed to form the Cloud Provider Special
Interest Group (SIG), with a mission to externalize all cloud provider
integrations and remove all the existing in-tree cloud provider integrations.
In January 2019, the Kubernetes community approved the initial draft of

Netflix formed its own studios in Helsinki and California last year, and acquired four other studios, including Oxenfree developer Night School Studio and Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox.
Verdu said the six studios are working on over 10 games in an interview with Axios, and stated Netflix has a total of 90 games in development through deals with external teams.

The American film and TV production company is known for its surreal work, making it a good fit for Kojima (in my opinion). It also acts as a distributor for films, with titles such as the Oscar winning Everything Everywhere All At Once and the brilliant (also in my opinion) Ex Machina included in its library. 


"A24 was born into this world about 10 years ago, their presence is singular within the industry, they are like no other. The films they are delivering to the world are high in quality and very innovative," Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima said following the announcement.

After years of waiting, Rockstar gave us our first slice of GTA 6 last week with a new trailer. Soon after, the studio confirmed the game will release sometime in 2025 on both Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. At the time of writing, there is no word on a PC release window.


According to York, who worked on the likes of GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 during his time at Rockstar, a PC port of a big AAA games takes longer to come out than console because a studio has to "prioritise what sells".

Insomniac confirmed Marvel's Spider-Man 2 would - like its predecessor - be getting a New Game Plus mode just prior to its launch back in October, with the developer saying it hoped to have the feature in players' hands "before end of year".


That, alas, will no longer be the case; Insomniac has now revealed Spider-Man 2's next major update - which will contain a number of "eagerly awaited" features including audio descriptions and the aforementioned New Game Plus - is now targeting a release "early" next year. "We have been working vigilantly on these features," the studio explained in a statement posted to social media, "and require more testing to ensure the quality is up to our standards".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were wondering where Fallout 4's "next-gen" update had got to, there's a bit of bad news; Bethesda has officially pushed its release out of 2023 and into next year.


Bethesda initially revealed it was working on a "next-gen" update for Fallout 4 back in October last year, as part of its 25th anniversary celebrations for the series. It promised Performance and Resolution mode options, enabling players to choose between high frame rates or 4K resolution gameplay, as well as miscellaneous bug fixes and "bonus" Creation Club content.


The update was originally planned to arrive for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC at some unspecified point this year, but Bethesda has now shunted the whole thing into 2024, saying it needs "a bit more time" to get things in order for release.

December also ushers in first-person retro shooter Prodeus, Capcom's acclaimed Mega Man 11, plus a triple helping of turn-based tactical RPG action in Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video games love spiders but arachnophobes obviously don't, and we've seen an increasing number of studios attempting to find a comfortable middle ground - usually an adorable, blobby middle ground - for all involved in recent times. Enter developer Zeekerss, which has now taken its own delightfully literal approach to solving the ongoing spider problem in its smash-hit co-op horror Lethal Company.


Lethal Company - which has proven to be an unexpectedly huge success since launching into early access in October, remaining high on Steam's top-selling and most played charts - runs the gamut of horrors, pitting players against everything from ghost girls and mechanical bees to eyeless dogs and spring-loaded mannequins as they scavenge its moon bases.


But as of this week's Frosty Update, players will no longer be forced to recoil in horror as its scuttling bunker spiders do their rounds. In perhaps the simplest, most effective attempt yet at making a game less of an ordeal for those with an aversion to eight-legged creatures, Zeekerss has introduced an arachnophobia mode that swaps out their scuttling heft for the word "spider", comically overlaid where the critter in question should be.

Smelling the fumes has become something of a meme on the Steam Deck subreddit, for apparently smelling quite nice. If you search "smell" over there, you'll find a whole range of posts from people discovering the vents smell "bloody delightful", asking how to return their Steam Deck once the fan stopped smelling, and pleas for Valve to release a Steam Deck cologne or scented candle.
If Valve wasn't aware of this habit before, it definitely is now thanks to Metapod100 on Reddit, who shared a screenshot of a reply they received from Steam Support. Their support ticket? "Is it safe to inhale the exhaust fumes from the top of the Steam Deck Vent?"

In Tears of the Kingdom, you can find some objects owned by Zelda inside Link's house in Hateno Village. There's only one bed in the house, which led some fans to believe the pair had moved in together after the events of Breath of the Wild. 
In an interview with IGN, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma suggested the development team doesn't have an answer and instead wants players to come to their own conclusions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the ESA's announcement that E3 is no more, developers and industry figures have been sharing their memories of the event as they wish it farewell.
The death of E3 was formally announced yesterday, but was suspected following the cancellation of the convention for 2023 and the foreseeable future.
Reactions have been pouring in from fans who attended E3 in the past, those who never had the chance to go, and the developers who were there to present their games to the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's looking increasingly unlikely Starfield will have the quite same kind of longevity as its Bethesda RPG stablemates, but that isn't discouraging the studio from continuing to tinker with the space adventure's core - and one intriguing addition Bethesda has now confirmed is that "new ways of traveling" are coming at some point in 2024.


Bethesda teased new modes of travel in an update shared on Reddit to accompany the launch of a small patch addressing Starfield's "pet-asteroid" bug - which has amusingly caused some players to be relentlessly followed across the solar system by doggedly persistent space rocks.


"We've been hard at work on many of the issues you've posted," Bethesda explained in its message to players, "and expect an update early next year that will include a large number of 'in-progress' quest fixes as well as FSR3 and XeSS. Though we fixed several quest issues from occurring, in-progress quest fixes are much harder to fix and we've built a new system to correct those without you having to roll back your save."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been five years since David Szymanski and New Blood Interactive's critically acclaimed retro FPS Dusk first emerged - effectively heralding start of the 'boomer shooter' resurgence as it did so - and to celebrate the occasion, a special "HD remaster" has been released as free DLC.


Dusk, with its furiously paced action and unapologetically chunky polygons, draws inspiration from the first-person shooter legends of the mid-90s - Quake being an obvious influence - taking players on a hellish Lovecraftian adventure deep beneath the Earth's surface. It's got cultists, a metal soundtrack, three campaign episodes, and a varied arsenal ranging from shotguns to crossbows and swords. It is a good time!


And now, five years after its release, Dusk is ready to careen into the modern era (assuming that modern era is circa the early 2000s) with an HD remaster that features remade assets for all existing visual elements - including enemy and weapon models - alongside a few new ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's all a bit Doom-y at the moment, what with the seminal first-person shooter having just celebrated its 30th anniversary this past weekend. And with perfect timing, original Doom designer John Romero has released Sigil 2, the follow-up to his 2019 unofficial Doom episode, which is available now as a free download for consoles and PC.


The original Sigil, which was announced to mark Doom's 25th back in 2018, served as the unofficial fifth episode in the Doom saga, picking up after the events of Ultimate Doom's Thy Flesh Consumed; Sigil 2 - as you might very well imagine - serves as unofficial episode number six, spanning nine new maps that lead into the story of Doom 2.


"Upon breaching the pentagram of invulnerability in the final moments of Sigil, Episode Five," goes Romero's official description, "you find yourself not on a victorious journey back to save Earth, but caught in Baphomet's cunning snare, catapulted into a new, grotesque domain of relentless torment, unending demon hordes, and an onslaught of heavy metal mayhem!"

Earlier today, Cyber Daily reported Rhysida had posted proof-of-hack documents. This included details of Insomniac's Wolverine game, which is rumoured to be out in 2025, as well as internal emails, files, and personal documents of Insomniac employees. One document reportedly belongs to Peter Parker voice actor Yuri Lowenthal. 
Rhysida has given Insomniac seven days before it publishes everything it stole, Cyber Daily reports, but the group also has the data up for auction, with a starting price of 50 bitcoins (just over $2m).

The debate has been argued ever since the release of Breath of the Wild, and Aonuma gave his thoughts on the topic in a new interview with IGN.
"It's interesting when I hear people say [I miss traditional linear Zelda]," Aonuma revealed, "because I'm wondering 'why do you want to go back to a type of game where you're more limited or more restricted in the types of things or ways you can play?'"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has won its antitrust case against Google, after the jury gave its verdict yesterday.
In August 2020, Epic implemented a method to circumvent Apple and Google fees on in-game payments in the iOS and Android versions of Fortnite. The two platform-holders swiftly retaliated by pulling the game from their storefronts. Epic subsequently filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google, accusing both companies of anti-competitive behaviour and market monopolisation.
The case against Apple was settled by a court judge in September 2021 in favour of Apple on nine of 10 counts, and earlier this year the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulings after appeals from both parties. Epic's case against Google has had a dramatically different result, with the jury deciding in favour of Epic on all counts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original creators of Jet Set Radio are involved with the series' new games announced last week.  
In Sega Sammy's most recent financial report, the company revealed plans to revive many of its legacy franchises - which were described by chief operating officer Shuji Utsumi as "a kind of Treasure Island". Publisher Sega then confirmed a flurry of projects planned for various retro series - including Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, and Streets of Rage - during The Game Awards. 
Speaking to The Washington Post, Sega's chief operating officer Shuji Utsumi said the original's concept was "advanced" but audiences were more open-minded now - and that now was a "good time where people can appreciate all kinds of concepts".

Larian made the announcement today via a post on X, formerly Twitter, in which the studio said it had also pushed a small update live for Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox that contained "stability fixes".


"We're aware of saves disappearing after a crash," Larian continued. "An update is available from Xbox to help with some of these issues, please manually update your Xbox through the system menu."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eagle-eyed fans have spotted several apparent references to the Silent Hill series in the first trailer for Hideo Kojima's Xbox project OD.
Kojima debuted OD officially at The Game Awards 2023 last week, where he revealed it will feature Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer and Udo Kier, as well as some involvement with director Jordan Peele.
Of course, Kojima was previously set to helm Silent Hills, a new Silent Hill game which would feature Norman Reedus, along with director Guillermo del Toro. Although the game was cancelled in 2015 following Konami and Kojima's split, the P.T. playable teaser gave fans an idea of what to expect.

Adding support for instrument controllers is "a priority", according to an FAQ page for the mode published by Epic Games. 


Fortnite Festival went live on Saturday, and lets you tap along to music using buttons on your controller or keyboard (as in, a keyboard for your PC). It is very like Rock Band, which is perhaps not surprising, with tracks available for different instruments and with various difficulty options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War actor Christopher Judge made another memorable appearance at last week's The Game Awards, this time to present an award rather than receive one - and to make a joke at Modern Warfare 3's expense.


(Or perhaps he never really left the stage, and simply continued last year's infamously-long acceptance speech?)


This year, Judge raised eyebrows and prompted sounds of shock from the audience when he compared the length of his 2022 speech to this year's short Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 campaign. "My speech was actually longer," he joked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following scrutiny from developers, The Game Awards founder and host Geoff Keighley has said he agrees the allotted speech time for each winner was too short this year.
Winners had 30 seconds to make their speeches, after which the music to play them off stage was started and they were drowned out. Developers criticised the short time, especially in the context of a ceremony which should be celebrating their hard work.
Writing on X (née Twitter) the day after the show, Keighley admitted award winners should have been allowed more time for their speeches, albeit in a roundabout way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Treyarch's upcoming Call of Duty game, set to release in 2024, will reportedly bring the return of Warzone's original map, Verdansk.

While it admits that details remain a little hazy, Insider Gaming reckons "the current plan is to follow the traditional Warzone 'main map' release schedule and have Verdansk return as a part of Black Ops Gulf War Season 1".

By examining how Activision typically schedules its releases, that suggests Verdansk will be making a comeback to the free-to-play battle royale shooter by the end of 2024.

Sullivan – a former tattoo model who went viral in 2017 when his mugshot showed off his resemblance to the Joker – was quick to jump on social media to discuss his uncanny similarites to a character that pops up in the GTA 6 teaser.  

Last Tuesday, Sullivan responded to the trailer on TikTok and said he thought a character had been "inspired by [him]", and invited Rockstar to get in touch to "talk". It wasn't clear, though, if he was calling out the company for using his likeness without his permission or if he was extending a call for a deeper collaboration.

<blockquote><p>The woman&#8212;who has only been identified by her surname, Wang&#8212;was having a meal with friends at a hotpot restaurant in Kunming, a city in southwest China. When everyone’s selections arrived at the table, she posted a photo of the spread on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. What she didn’t notice was that she&#8217;d included the QR code on her table, which the restaurant’s customers use to place their orders.</p>
<p>Even though the photo was only shared with her WeChat friends list and not the entire social network, someone&#8212;or a lot of someones&#8212;used that QR code to add a ridiculous amount of food to her order. Wang was absolutely shocked to learn that &#8220;her&#8221; meal soon included 1,850 orders of duck blood, 2,580 orders of squid, and an absolutely bonkers 9,990 orders of shrimp paste...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ready for another new Fortnite game mode? After yesterday's big launch of Lego Fortnite, today brings Rocket Racing - and, again, you can play it for free right now.


Developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix, Rocket Racing is an arcade racer with shades of Mario Kart and Burnout, blended with some of Rocket League's mechanics. 


You can roar around tracks, slipstream past or slam into rivals to knock them about, aim for boost pads, avoid obstacles, and accumulate boost by drifting. You also have a limited ability to jump - sending your vehicle soaring vertically upwards to higher portions of track or over barriers and through waterfalls to secret shortcuts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As is now something of an end-of-year tradition, Hello Games has announced it's re-running all this year's No Man's Sky limited-time Expeditions (plus a bonus one from 2021) throughout the festive period for those that missed them - and their associated rewards - first time around.


Expeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are essentially curated several-hour-long campaigns that condense and reshuffle No Man's Sky's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges that play out on a brand-new save - with exclusive (and often extremely nifty) rewards unlocking as you complete each tier.


2023, which has been another busy year for No Man's Sky,  has seen the release of three Expeditions in total, beginning with Utopia in February. This one sees Travellers teaming up to rebuild an abandoned solar system for the mysterious Utopia Foundation, with rewards including the Fearsome Visor helmet, a new robotic drone companion, plus a new ship type known as the Utopia Speeder. Hello Games will be giving players another chance to tackle Utopia starting today, 8th December, until 15h December.

When asked about the possibility of a direct sequel to TOTK, Aonuma said making a sequel to a game which is already a sequel would be "getting a little bit wild".

So what can we expect to see in Monster Hunter Wilds, as the "next generation" of the series is known? Well, starting off in a dusty desert world, the trailer shows off some large migrating herds of smaller creatures - far more dense than anything we've really seen before in the series - as well as a new bird-like mode of transport for Hunters.


We get vast swirling sandstorms, violent storms raining lightning down upon the earth as creatures rampage, and, well, that's about it for the moment - although I'm sure more eagle-eyed fans will have picked the whole thing more thoroughly apart by the morning.

It's a fresh IP from Sharkmob, the studio founded in 2017 by core members of The Division team, now working across two studios in Malmö and London. The developer's first project - battle royale Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodhunt - shut down in May, after failing to find an audience.


Tonight's reveal at The Game Awards offered us a brief glimpse of Exoborne's post-apocalyptic world, set in a ruined southeastern US now filled with apocalyptic-looking tornadoes, lightning and sandstorms.

Hello Games has just answered that very question with the reveal of its next title, Light No Fire, a co-operative adventure set on a procedurally generated fantasy planet.


Specifics are limited at present, but Hello describes Light No Fire as a game about "adventure, building, survival and exploration together" set on an ancient fantasy planet the size of Earth, that "brings the depth of a role playing game to the freedom of a survival sandbox".


The planet itself is procedurally generated, offering a "truly open world, with no boundaries at a scale never attempted before", consisting of "immersive biomes, unique enemies and valuable resources to discover". It's all inspired by classic fantasy - "lore, mystery, and a constant fight for survival" are promised - and it'll see players teaming up to "carve a life together", exploring and surviving, constructing persistent buildings and communities, and more.

The Finals is a free-to-play game so there's nothing to pay up front until you want to buy cosmetics or the Battle Pass, the first season of which obviously begins today.
I played a pre-launch build of The Finals last week ahead of today's surprise-drop. New in it was the Las Vegas casino level, which brings the total launch map-count to four. In Vegas you'll find huge casino buildings to play around in and on top of, and there are sandstorms and traps and tripwires to mix things up.

Den of Wolves (which was teased back in August) got its formal unveiling at this year's The Game Awards via an enigmatic reveal trailer, but I had the opportunity to spent some time with 10 Chambers co-founder and narrative director Simon Viklund ahead of the show, to learn a little more about the studio's plans for the project.


With development on 10 Chambers' debut game, acclaimed hardcore sci-fi shooter GTFO, formally at an end with the release of today's The Final Chapter update, the studio's focus is now on to Den of Wolves, which Viklund describes as a continuation and evolution of the mechanics seen in Payday: The Heist and Payday 2. It's a project that came about because the team felt there was still "untapped potential in the heist genre" - and because it was desperately keen to escape the oppressive squalor of GTFO's corridors for airier climes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Development on 10 Chambers' rock-hard co-op horror shooter GTFO is officially coming to an end today after three years of robust post-launch support with one last update, the appropriately titled The Final Chapter.


GTFO - which sends teams of up to four players on regular expeditions deep into the bowels of a vast underground complex overrun by terrifying creatures - got its version 1.0 release back in December 2019 after two years of early access. It's essentially been run as a live-service-style title since then (albeit without any live-service-style monetisation), adding a succession of time-limited story missions, maps, and other content.


10 Chambers announced a change in its update strategy last December that would see it reinstate all Rundowns (as the limited-time events were known) so that players have permanent access to all previous story content - equating to over 80 expeditions - and today's Final Chapter update means GTFO now officially has a beginning, middle, and end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jurassic Park: Survival was announced at this evening's Game Awards.


It's an upcoming single-player action-adventure game set the day after the events of the 1993 Jurassic Park film. Judging by the announcement trailer, we will play as a character called Maya on the game's release (which is TBC). 


She is aware she is alone on the island of Nublar, as I guess Alan and co forgot to make sure everyone was off the island before they took flight. Seems a bit remiss of them, really.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wondering what Hideo Kojima's been brewing between Strandings? Well, we finally have an answer - albeit an extremely enigmatic one - courtesy of a teaser for new Xbox horror game OD.


A Kojima horror has been rumoured for quite some time, of course, with reports surfacing last year that the Death Stranding creator was cooking up a little something called Overdose.


That, it turns out, was mostly right, with Kojima's new project now revealed under the name OD. As for what it actually is, well, that's currently unclear, with Kojima and friends successfully taking up 10 minutes of tonight's The Game Awards without revealing much of anything at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year's The Case of the Golden Idol was a murder-mystery treat, and developer Color Gray Games has now revealed there's more deductive adventure on the way in follow-up The Rise of the Golden Idol, launching for PC and consoles next year.


The big change this time around is that The Rise of the Golden Idol ditches the 18th century setting of its predecessor in favour of a slightly more contemporary time period, whisking players to the 1970s where they'll need to solve 15 new cases of "crime, death and depravity".


The Rise of the Golden Idol will see players attempting to make sense of a grand mystery in an age of "hallucinogens, fax machines, parapsychology and TV guides", in a quest that'll bring them face-to-face with "enlightenment seekers, convicts, chat show hosts and corporate middle management" - all with their their own motives and agendas.

The original Pony Island - a genre-shifting delve into a demonically possessed arcade cabinet - was emphatically not about ponies (well, not exactly), and its sequel promises to continue that tradition, offering a "phantasmagorical voyage through time, myth, divinity, and video game".


This time around, you're cast as a young nomad doomed to live out their untimely death within The Earth Prison. The goal, explains Mullins over on Pony Island 2's newly revealed Steam page, is to "escape the lordly deities of the underworld with your soul, and your sanity, intact."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Motion Twin's hugely acclaimed - and dazzlingly well supported - action-platformer Dead Cells hasn't stop turning heads since its early access debut back in 2017, and it's fair to say interest in what the studio will do next is high; and we finally have an answer courtesy of The Game Awards, which has given a first look at Motion Twin's Windblown, a "lightning-fast combat roguelite" coming to Steam early access in 2024. 


Windblown is a "tough but always fair" combat-focused adventure - playable either solo or with up to three friends online - that casts participants as Leapers, warriors charged with protecting their home world, The Ark, from the deadly Vortex and its Sentinel minions.


Specifics remain relatively limited at this early juncture, but its reveal trailer - giving off some deliciously appealing Saturday-morning-cartoon-but-with-gruesome-flesh-rending vibes - points to an experience at least superficially resembling a kind of co-operate Hyper Light Drifter thanks to its rapid-fire dash mechanics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Employees at Destiny 2 developer Bungie have said they feel anxious about their current status at the company, following layoffs earlier this year.


As you may recall, layoffs were first reported at the developer in October. At this time, studio CEO Pete Parsons publicly commented on the cuts, calling it "a sad day". Around 100 employees were said to be affected.


Now, in a new report by IGN, many remaining at the company have said the studio is implementing a variety of other cost-cutting measures across the board, in order to remain an independent subsidiary within Sony (which acquired the developer in 2022). There is concern among staff that Bungie may lose its independence within Sony should Destiny 2 fail to meet financial goals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has released a new and quite chunky update for Skyrim Special Edition, which in itself isn't all that remarkable. Sure the game is several years old now, but it is still very popular with players, so why not give the game a boost if it needs it.

However, this particular update has gone down rather badly with Skyrimmers, as it has reintroduced a paid mod platform into the game. 
To get you up to speed as to why this has been controversial, all the way back in 2015, Bethesda partnered with Valve to bring paid mods to Skyrim via Steam. However, it was incredibly unpopular with both players and mod makers, and the publisher removed the option to sell Skyrim mods on Valve's platform shortly after this idea made its debut.

Following Ser Aylin's upload by user Yedlike to Nexus Mods on 3rd December, Baldur's Gate 3 fans protested against the mod and asked others to not support it, noting it's part of a larger mod pack called No Alphabets. On 4th December, Nexus banned Yedlike for violating its community rules.

1.3m players have finished the game's campaign at least once since Baldur's Gate 3 first released fully in August. If you're curious like me, you may be wondering what percentage of players this represents.

"Though our commitment to our beloved starship adventure sim is unwavering, rapidly rising operation costs, a worsening AUD/USD exchange rate, poor Early Access sales, and the unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities across the industry, have placed us in a position where, as it currently stands, we are unable to sustain the cost of operations through to the release of v1.0, which was planned for Q2 of 2024," Kusters wrote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lamplighters League might have officially flopped according to publisher Paradox Interactive, but that hasn't stopped developer Harebrained Schemes from making improvements to its pulp strategy adventure since its arrival - and its latest free update is perhaps its biggest yet, adding a new playable character and new events system.


The Lamplighters League, which launched to a mix reception back in October, blends tactical turn-based action and real-time stealth in a globe-trotting adventure inspired by the classic pulp stories of the 1930s, putting players in control of a disparate group of rogues as they attempt to thwart an occult-obsessed cabal known as the Banished Court.


And as of today, with the launch of The Lamplighters League's 1.3 update, the number of available playable rogues has swelled by one thanks to the arrival of Isaac Greymoor. Described as a "hot-headed, lead-slinging mercenary who wields a deadly light machine gun to devastating effect", Isaac is the sun of former Lamplighters League leader Lord Greymoor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wes Ball, the director of Nintendo's upcoming The Legend of Zelda movie, has discussed some of his ambitions for the project, saying he "would love to see a live-action Miyazaki" - a reference to legendary Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki, whose animated work includes Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Laputa: Castle in the Sky.


Ball, who has previously helmed the three Maze Runner films and is currently working on next year's King of the Planet of the Apes, was announced as the director of Nintendo's live-action The Legend of Zelda movie last month, as part of the project's official unveiling.


And now, speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Ball has shared a little of his vision for the Zelda film, describing it as "this awesome fantasy-adventure movie that isn't like Lord of the Rings, it's its own thing. I've always said, I would love to see a live-action Miyazaki. That wonder and whimsy that he brings to things, I would love to see something like that."

Atari 50, if you're unfamiliar, released at the tail-end of last year, drawing immediate acclaim for its wonderfully rich delve into Atari's 50-year history, mixing extensive interviews with designers, developers, and other prominent industry figures with archival content include documentary footage, design documents, and original artwork.


That in itself is an absolute treat, but Atari 50 also includes more than 90 playable arcade and console games from the company's illustrious, industry defining back catalogue, ranging from Pong and Breakout to the likes of Asteroids, Adventure, and more. It even features a number of previously unreleased titles, including Akka Arrh - which received an acclaimed reimagining from legendary developer Jeff Minter earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the first ever trailer for GTA 6 which was finally released following a tease from Rockstar, after the trailer leaked online ahead of schedule. 
That means we've got a look at the game's two protagonists, its modern day Vice City setting, and the general vibe of the game's story. We also know it's set for release in 2025 across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, with no news yet of a PC release. 
So what did we make of the trailer and the news? What are we hoping to see in GTA 6? And what's the future of GTA Online? Tom's away, so this week's podcast is hosted by me. I'm joined as ever by Eurogamer's Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan, as well as GTA Online expert Marie Pritchard from the Eurogamer guides team.

Bethesda is somewhat infamous for releasing some rather buggy games. These bugs are often amusing, and, in an odd way, an almost endearing feature that fans have come to expect with each release. 


But, despite them being a common Bethesda occurrence, the first season of Fallout will not include any playful references towards these unintentional video game issues, showrunners have now confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first season for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is set to arrive tomorrow, 6th December, across platforms. This will see a variety of in-game content added, including new Warzone map Urzikstan. This map will launch with 100 player count and, as noted by CharlieIntel, it is 20 percent smaller than the series' Al Mazrah map.


This has led some players to lament the comparatively condensed player numbers for each match. Typically, Warzone hosts 150-player lobbies.  However, developer Raven Software explained its decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating it will ensure a good gameplay balance.


"This morning we announced that the player count for Warzone Battle Royale is 100 players," reads the statement. "Our top priority is creating an optimal and fun experience for all of our players based on critical metrics.

The short teaser comes in at just shy of 50 seconds, and pans across some nice vistas - the port city in Antiva sits bathed in evening light, the Rivain shoreline is lapped by azure blue seas, Anderfels is in the midst of a storm. It is all very Dragon Age-y, much as you would expect.


"Enter Thedas, a vibrant land of rugged wilderness, treacherous labyrinths, and glittering cities - steeped in savage combat and secret magics. Now, its fate teeters on a knife's edge," the teaser's description reads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A seven-second TikTok video claiming to be a "first look at GTA 6" has gone viral, and unsubstantiated rumours reckon the leak comes via the son of a Rockstar developer.

It's almost impossible to go online these days without being smacked in the face by at least half a dozen purported GTA 6 "leaks", but this one was more plausible than most, which is probably why it gained traction. Quickly. 

Two videos have been posted by the seemingly throwaway account i_see_in_4k, and both have - in the last couple of hours – shared a few tantalising seconds of what the poster insists is GTA 6.

Its predecessor, WWE 2K23, was officially announced in January 2023, and released swiftly thereafter in March of that same year, leading some pundits to suggest that a similar timescale could apply here, too.

Whilst it's unlikely to come as a shock that the sequel was on the way, the rating board has seemingly confirmed the game's existence ahead of 2K's own marketing schedule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's taken five and a half years of asking from the community, but Sea of Thieves' oft-requested private servers are almost here, with Rare now confirming the feature will arrive as part of the multiplayer pirate adventure's third major Season 10 update on Thursday, 7th December.


Private servers will be available under the new banner of Safer Seas mode, which'll co-exist alongside the current shared world experience - officially renamed High Seas. Safer Seas enables up to four friends to crew a ship across a private version of the world and access all PvE content - ranging from emergent events to Trading Company quests and narrative-driven Tall Tales - without needing to deal with other crews.


It is, then, pretty much exactly what people have been asking for since Sea of Thieves' launch back in 2018, albeit with a number of restrictions. Features including Guilds, Hourglass Factions, and live-service events such as Gold & Glory are all unavailable, and Rare is capping Trading Company progression at 40 in Safer Seas, meaning it won't be possible to reach Pirate Legend status without returning to High Seas mode. Additionally, gold or reputation for Athena's Fortune or their Reaper's Bones counterpart won't be earnable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to Cyberpunk 2077's E3 2018 trailer and you might remember Night City's metro system playing a prominent role - which was why its absence as a fully functional transportation service was so notable come the game's beleagured release in December 2020. Three years later though, CD Projekt has announced it's restoring the long-missing rideable metro system in a surprise 2.1 update arriving next Tuesday, 5th December.


The 2.1 update coincides with the launch of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition (bundling together the base game and Phantom Liberty expansion) and was detailed in a new developer livestream, beginning with that long-awaited Metro system. "The metro was not in our plans for a long time," producer Monika Janowska explained during the presentation. "However, over time we've revisited our plan and... decided that it actually could be achievable."


Night City's metro system, officially known as Night City Area Rapid Transit and described as an "immersive way to travel through the world", consists of five lines spanning 19 stations. It unlocks after Cyberpunk's Konpeki Plaza sequence relatively early on and can either be used as fast travel locations (as was the case prior to 2.1) or "as a proper metro ride experience" for those who'd like to take in the sights in a more leisurely fashion.

Just over two years after launch, a fresh reveal for Halo Infinite will apparently arrive on Monday, 4th December at 5pm UK time.


The announcement was made this evening by Microsoft via a post on X, formerly Twitter, made to look like Rockstar's GTA 6 trailer post from this afternoon. The accompanying image shows the softly-lit silhouette of a Halo ring (rather than palm trees and seagulls).
