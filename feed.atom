        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has confirmed plans to release a "self-serve" tool that will make its proprietary Stadia controller function on other platforms via Bluetooth.

This hopefully means that the controller - which is currently locked so it only connects to Google's cloud gaming service, Stadia - will still be usable even after Google shutters Stadia later this week.                                                                                                                                                                       

"We've also got Bluetooth news: next week we'll be releasing a self-serve tool to enable Bluetooth connections on your Stadia Controller," the official Stadia Twitter account tweeted last night. "We'll share details here on release."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gun Interactive has revealed more details about its take on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, a new asymmetrical horror game set to release later this year.

A new behind-the-scenes video focuses on the motion-capture process, and we're also given a peek at the new single Tragic from Remains, a companion album to the game's official soundtrack.                                                                                                                                                                                        

"Shot on location at The House of Moves in Los Angeles, the video diary gives horror fans a fascinating window into the method of mo-cap, illustrating some of the key choreography and physical performance that goes into animating character movements," Gun explains.

<blockquote><p>Author and public-interest security technologist Schneier (<em>Data and Goliath</em>, 2015) defines a “hack” as an activity allowed by a system “that subverts the rules or norms of the system [&#8230;] at the expense of someone else affected by the system.” In accessing the security of a particular system, technologists such as Schneier look at how it might fail. In order to counter a hack, it becomes necessary to think like a hacker. Schneier lays out the ramifications of a variety of hacks, contrasting the hacking of the tax code to benefit the wealthy with hacks in realms such as sports that can innovate and change a game for the better. The key to dealing with hacks is being proactive and providing adequate patches to fix any vulnerabilities. Schneier’s fascinating work illustrates how susceptible many systems are to being hacked and how lives can be altered by these subversions. Schneier’s deep dive into this cross-section of technology and humanity makes for investigative gold...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The multiplayer arcade title became available overnight, just days before Google's innovative cloud gaming service terminates for good on 18th January, 2023. 

In a bittersweet twist, this means that Worm Game is both the last game to release on the service and the first, as it was used to test features from before Stadia's 2019 launch right up until last year.

As spotted by PC Gamer, a poster by the name of Leakerwanderer has uploaded asset repositories of Valve games as they were in 2016, including Portal, CS: Source, Team Fortress 2, Day of Defeat: Source, and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1, 2, and Half-Life 2 multiplayer. 

Despite being "threatened every time" - although by whom and why, we don't know - Leakerwanderer took to Discord to say that they now "don't care anymore" and uploaded the huge files, which include 61GB of Team Fortress 2 assets alone, including cut and modified content collated over many, many years.

The update ushers in changes to Vikendi, Sanhok, and Taego, as well as an "update to the 1v1 Arena in Training Mode". You can check out the highlights in the helpful video embedded below:

Vikendi's changes include multidrops - which means multiple care packages holding high-tier loot will randomly drop throughout the match - as well as Repair Kits which do exactly what they say on the tin and enable players to repair helmets and armour, plus vehicles, too, if you final the Mechanic's Toolbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following this week's announcement of yet another delay for Skull and Bones, Ubisoft has shared 30 minutes of new footage from its beleaguered pirate adventure, focusing on what it calls the game's "narrative gameplay".


It's perhaps something of an unexpected place to return after a lengthy absence, given Ubisoft insisted Skull and Bones was "not a narrative-driven game" last summer, but it does at least give players a better idea of how the publisher is attempting to inject a bit of variety into the action.


As Ubisoft explained last year, Skull and Bones is overwhelmingly focused on sailing and combat, with players only able to disembark their ships and explore dry land at a limited number of locations, defined as outposts. Functionally, outposts serve as places players can trade, cash in contracts, pay off factions, and meet other players - but, as detailed in Ubisoft's latest gameplay devstream, they're also locations where they might find narrative content Ubisoft is calling "investigations".

The Division 2 arrived on Steam on 12th January, but similarly does not include Steam Achievements resulting in a backlash from fans.

This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07321.pdf">paper</a> is a good survey of the field: what the threats are, how we might detect machine-generated text, directions for future research.

<blockquote><p>Machine Generated Text: A Comprehensive Survey of Threat Models and Detection Methods</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Advances in natural language generation (NLG) have resulted in machine generated text that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human authored text. Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and  accountability...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

"I'm a big video game fan, so I played all the games," Carpenter told Variety. "I was down looking at the new digital cameras, the RED, and happened to mention to them that I would love to do a Dead Space film. That just went around, and everybody said, 'Oh, when are you gonna do it?'"

Last night, upset at expected changes in the updated OGL resulted in a widely-shared push by D&D fans and streamers to ditch the game's online subscription, D&D Beyond. 


Gizmodo, which initially published details of the updated OGL last week, subsequently reported that this latest backlash has prompted Wizards of the Coast to cancel its plans to formally announce the changes for the time being, leaving the company's upper management in a "scramble to adjust their messaging around the situation".

Sources told the website both Google and Nvidia had "expressed concerns" to the Federal Trade Commision (FTC), which sued to block the deal in December.


The FTC has argued the buyout, which would grant Microsoft ownership of the likes of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, would reduce competition in the industry - a claim Microsoft has strongly denied. A trial is set for August.

Skull and Bones, which has been in development since 2013, was revealed in 2017 but has faced repeated delays since then, its release most recently being moved from November 2022 to March 2023. Yesterday though, Ubisoft confirmed it was pushing the troubled game's launch back yet again, this time to "early" in the fiscal year 2023-24.


In a follow-up statement shared by the official Skull and Bones Twitter account, Ubisoft spoke a little more about the delay, saying its "determination and focus remain the same - offer the best in-game experience possible to our play from day 1".

That's according to NBC News, which obtained a copy of the criminal complaint filed against Roiland through the Orange County Superior Court, charging him with "one felony count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud and/or deceit".


The complaint relates to an incident which took place on or around 19th January 2020, involving "an anonymous Jane Doe who was dating Roiland at the time." Roiland is said to have been charged in May 2020 then arrested and released on a $50,000 USD bond in August of the same year. He was then arraigned in October 2020 and pleaded not guilty to both charges.

Launched in 2016, GOG Connect was a neat proposition on paper, allowing users to link their GOG and Steam accounts and then get a duplicate, DRM-free version of a game they'd already purchased on Valve's platform over on GOG.


In practice, though, it was all a bit restrictive, with GOG only offering a very limited selection of eligible games - and even those could only be added to a user's GOG library within a very strict timeframe for contractual reasons. Perhaps unsurprisingly, support for the service slowly dwindled and GOG Connect has now been inactive (if not officially dead) for years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a bit of an irresistable deal for point-and-click adventure fans: you can currently get 13 titles from publisher and developer Wadjet Eye Games' library of superb point-and-click adventures for just £8, courtesy of Humble Bundle.


Wadjet Eye, if you're unfamiliar, has been releasing highly acclaimed, old-school-inspired point-and-click adventures - complete with some gorgeous pixel art - since 2006. The studio's earliest titles - namely Shivah, which explores themes around the Jewish faith, and the entire Blackwell supernatural detective series - are all present and correct in Humble's latest bundle.


And it continues, serving up some real gems as the bundle shifts through sci-fi - in Resonance, TechnoBabylon, and Gemini Rue - to post-apocalyptic nightmare in Shardlight and Promordia to something altogether weirder with Wormwood Studios' acclaimed Strangeland, in which a man must unravel his past while exploring a terrifyingly surreal carnival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello and welcome back to the Eurogamer Newscast! We're already almost halfway through January 2023 and the video games industry is stirring. There are huge games on the horizon and plenty to look forward to - and look forward we will. 

2023 promises to be a stellar year for video games, full of proper current-gen console exclusives, awesome indies and more than a few titles held up from last year (and the year before). The next 12 months should see all of these and more splurge out onto the scene for you to try. But where to start? 
Joining me to pick out our highlights for the year are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan - and there's some surprising picks in there, as well as Pikmin 4! Apparently some new Final Fantasy game is coming out too, and Zelda's up to something. Beyond video games themselves, there's also The Last of Us TV show to look forward to - that's out next week! - and hopefully some recommendations from us for some lesser-known gems also waiting in the wings. Thanks for watching!

Now, I know what you are thinking: "Victoria, why would you care about this? You would have been a newborn when this cartoon was playing on TV and therefore have no idea what was happening. You were probably just learning what your hand was or experiencing mashed potatoes for the first time."


This is very true. I was. But I'm also a huge Legend of Zelda fan, and that means as soon as I was aware of the existence of the Zelda cartoon, I tracked it down and watched it for myself. And then, when I had children of my own, I watched it again with them on YouTube. It was a family affair and, as it turns out, having this series become a bit of an ongoing family affair was also a theme during the cartoon's conception. How's that for a segue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 developer Bungie has announced a major change for the game's selection of armour mods, which - as you might expect - allow you to modify your character's abilities.


Beginning now, all "standard" armour mods have been unlocked for all players - a move Bungie says is designed to allow "everyone a chance to enjoy all mods in their current state" ahead of the upcoming Lightfall expansion, which will feature "big changes" to buildcrafting. 


It's an interesting move which will allow players far more freedom to experiment with armour mods to find the setup that best suits their playstyle - without relying on the random chances of particular mods turning up for sale via Ada-1's in-game shop.

Kubernetes has been widely adopted, and many organizations use it as their de-facto orchestration engine for running workloads that need to be created and deleted frequently.
Therefore, proper scheduling of the pods is key to ensuring that application pods are up and running within the Kubernetes cluster without any issues. This article delves into the use cases around resource management by leveraging the PriorityClass object to protect mission-critical or high-priority pods from getting evicted and making sure that the application pods are up, running, and serving traffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MechWarrior 5 developer Piranha Games is working on a new title in the long-running MechWarrior series, with the studio currently aiming to release the project in 2024.


Piranha Games president Russ Bullock shared the news during an interview with the NoGutsNoGalaxy podcast (thanks PC Gamer), teasing, "I'll just say that it's not MechWarrior Online 2, it's not the successor to MechWarrior Online, it's not an online PvP [game] - think of it more in line with MechWarrior 5, but a standalone game, a standalone product."


According to Bullock, the currently mysterious title - which is being developed for PC and consoles - follows "more of a single-player co-op type of pathway". Beyond that, though, details are thin, and a full reveal may not happen until this autumn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has confirmed the cancellation of three unannounced games following disappointing financial results for its most recent quarter, with the publisher's troubled pirate adventure Skull and Bones also having received a further delay.


Announcing the news, Ubisoft said it was facing "major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles", compounded by the underperformance of recent launches including Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023.


Ubisoft says the resulting financial pressures have triggered a full review of its revenue prospects, leading to an "increased cautiousness over the coming years". As a result it has decided to cancel three unannounced projects, on top of the four games cancelled last July.

Back 4 Blood is, of course, the co-op zombie shooter from Left 4 Dead studio Turtle Rock, which aims to give the genre of a bit of a twist through game-altering deck building. Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition, meanwhile, is Capcom's well-regarded most recent chapter in the long-running demonic hack-and-slash series. 


Acclaimed supernatural narrative adventure series Life is Strange is actually joining the PlayStation Plus catalogue with two instalments - developer Dontnod's initial episodic adventure and Deck Nine's prequel Before the Storm, which follows the adventures of Chloe Price before she met the first game's protagonist Max Caulfield.

However, if you are anything like me and a big fan of The Last of Us, this show may well make the eye bags and inevitable reliance on intravenous coffee to get you through the rest of the next day worthwhile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite has brought back its long-lost plague doctor character set for the first time in three years, following a believed forced absence during the Covid pandemic. 


Scourge and Plague (1500 V-Bucks each) returned to Fortnite's infamous rotating item shop at midnight last night, after an absence of 1080 days. Both are styled after the beaked physicians seen in the 16th and 17th centuries who treated bubonic plague victims.


Originally released in late 2018, the skins formed a regular and popular set which went on sale every couple of months - until their last appearance at the end of January 2020. At the time, I remember their spotlight in the item shop raising eyebrows, as the early stages of the Covid pandemic were already dominating global news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTubers have reported seeing their work retroactively slapped with unexpected age restrictions, or being demonetised, as a result of the platform's recent rule changes regarding profanity usage and violent content in videos uploaded to the site.


These changes, which were first laid out by YouTube in November, state the platform's "approach to profanity is changing" (thanks, Kotaku).


Now, all profanities are "treated equally" across the site, meaning words like 'crap' carry the same weight as 'fuck' as far as inappropriate language use goes (the site has, however, eased its stance on both "hell" and "damn" - these words are no longer classed as profanities and can be used more freely).

The phenomenon of using machine learning to teach an AI program how to play Rocket League is nothing new, as this PC Gamer report delves into. Trained bots have been pitted against each other for a while in local matches, and the question of how much and how well an AI program can learn to play a game like Rocket League is an interesting one to answer.


The problem comes with the seemingly more recent discovery by players that versions of the game's AI-trained Nexto bot are now being used to cheat in Rocket League's competitive ranked play modes, disguised as human players.

On a Final Fantasy 14 Mahjong stream with the rest of the development team, Yoshida was asked about rumours of a Final Fantasy 16 PC release.


"I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that. In either case, please buy the PS5 [version]!" he said, as per a translation from streamer and translator Aitai Kimochi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're less than a week away from the highly anticipated debut of HBO's live-action The Last of Us TV adaptation and early reviews from critics are positively glowing, with the series currently enjoying a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes across more than 40 reviews at the time of writing.


First announced back in 2020, HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation has been written and created by Chernobyl's Craig Mazin, alongside Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann. It stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, with other notable cast members including Nick Offerman in the role of Bill, Jeffrey Pierce (who played Joel's brother Tommy in the Last of Us video games) as quarantine zone rebel Perry, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge, who reprises her video game role of Marlene, the leader of the Fireflies resistance.


The last few months have seen HBO's PR machine crank into top gear as The Last of Us' January release approaches, with December bringing the show's second full-length trailer. Now, though, some lucky professional critics have had the chance to watch the entirety of the show's first season, and - despite some notable changes to the source material - the praise is effusive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK government has passed a law mandating new homes in England must be built with "lightning-fast" gigabit-capable broadband connections.


Gigabit broadband - that is, broadband capable of download speeds of at least 1 gigabit-per-second - is currently available in over 72% of the UK, according to the government's figures. However, a new law, in effect since December, aims to increases that percentage further by making it a legal requirement that new homes are fitted with infrastructure and connections capable of delivering gigabit broadband.


"The updated regulations mean that more people moving into new homes will have a gigabit-capable broadband connection ready when construction is completed," the government explained, "avoiding the need for costly and disruptive installation work after the home is built and enabling residents to arrange the best possible internet service at the point they move in."

One Piece Odyssey unfolds on a mysterious island discovered by the Straw Hats pirate gang after their ship is caught in a storm. The ensuing action takes the form of an RPG, with open-world exploration punctuated by turn-based battles and dungeons - with each of the game's playable characters able to use their unique abilities in variety of situations, including battles, traversal, and puzzle solving.


Playable characters include Luffy, Zoro, Sani, Usopp, and Nami, with the likes of Portgas D. Ace and Trafalgar Law putting in an appearance as supporting characters that can fight alongside the core crew. In story terms, that's possible thanks to Memoria - a realm made of the Straw Hats' memories, which they'll need to explore to retrieve their lost abilities.

The UK trade organisation has estimated games made £4.66bn last year (a rise of 2.3 percent from 2021). This means that, once again, games are the biggest home entertainment industry in the UK (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). 


Most of this preliminary figure is made up by digital game sales, which according to ERA are estimated to represent around £4.17bn in revenue. This is a rise of 3.1 percent year-on-year.

The Shockwave Hammer, introduced last month alongside the game's bumper Chapter 4 revamp, was  disabled yesterday in several of Fortnite's competitive modes as a glitch which allowed players to repeatedly spam the item became rampant. 


Players have taken to social media over the past week to brand the game as "unplayable" after the glitch's use spread - allowing players to jump around the map non-stop, without the item's usual cooldown.

F1 Manager 2022 was an important launch for Frontier, announced as the first game in a new and lucrative annual franchise for the studio, following the studio's previous sales disappointment Jurassic World Evolution 2. 


But while initial "player engagement at release in August 2022" was "broadly in-line with original expectations", interest in the game soon dropped off and could not be revived despite "key holiday season price promotions", Frontier admitted in a financial update.

Bitmap's Mega Drive Visual Compendium would have been the eighth title in the striking Visual Compendium series, following books covering the gaming highlights and history of the Atari 2600/7800, Commodore 64, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, NES, SNES, and Master System.


The latter volume was produced in partnership with Sega, but despite Bitmap Books' efforts, its planned Mega Drive Visual Compendium didn't have the official backing of the company, ultimately leading to its demise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse, the third and regrettably final season of Telltale Games' episodic point-and-click adventure series, will be getting the remaster treatment in 2023 courtesy of developer Skunkape Games.


The Devil's Playhouse, which initially released all the way back in 2010, features yet more anarchic escapades from cult comic book artist Steve Purcell's crime-fighting dog and bunny duo Sam & Max, this time pitting the pair against Eldritch gods, alien warlords, and more in a battle to control an ancient, otherworldly power.


Skunkape hasn't said much too much about The Devil's Playhouse Remastered beyond confirmation it'll launch later this year, but it seems reasonable to expect the same kind of attention seen in the developer's previous Sam & Max remasters - Save the World and Beyond Time and Space - which featured the likes of enhanced graphics and audio, dynamic lighting, improved lip syncing, a new user interface, controller support, and more.

These will reportedly include Arkane's delayed Redfall, Turn 10 Studios' latest Forza Motorsport, Mojang's action-strategy spin-off Minecraft Legends, and unspecified "content" from content from ZeniMax Online Studios.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're mere weeks away from the release of EA Motive's extremely promising remake of sci-fi horror classic Dead Space, and to sweeten the deal for those considering a pre-order, EA is bundling in a copy of the original Dead Space 2 on Steam.


EA Motive's Dead Space remake - which launches for PC and current-gen consoles on 27th January - is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games' much-loved 2008 original, reimagining engineer Isaac Clarke's terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura with enhanced audio and visuals, gameplay refinements, and more.


As spotted by VG247, players that pre-order the remake on Steam will now get a nifty bonus in the form of 2011's Dead Space 2, meaning they can dive straight into the Isaac's continuing story when the credits roll. Despite its age, Dead Space 2 ordinarily costs £17.99 on Steam, so that's a decent saving for anyone who's yet to experience the well-regarded sequel.

However, over the weekend a fairly big change came to light - in HBO's take on the series, the Cordyceps infection will not be spread by spores in the air. Rather, it will be able to spread by "tendrils" that can become a "network that is interconnected".


During an interview with Collider, co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin spoke more about pandemics generally, and how the infection would be depicted in the show.

Earlier today, according to SteamDB, Steam set another all-time concurrent users of 33,078,963, but whilst the majority of those were logged in but idling, today Steam has also clocked up 10,284,568 active users.

The games keeping us busy this weekend? As is usually the case, the top two are CS:GO and Dota 2, but Among Us clone Goose Goose Duck jumps in to take the bronze. PUBG, Apex Legends, Lost Ark, GTA 5, Rust, Modern Warfare 2, and Wallpaper Engine round out the top ten respectively.

"Zombie_City is a map created by Valve (or possibly Turtle Rock Studios) that was a part of the map sources folder that released today," the mod description page teases (thanks, GamesRadar+). "It is likely the starting point of Left 4 Dead, and for those of you who have heard the name 'Terror-Strike' before, you will love to get the chance to play this prototype level.

The "R-Code exploit" not only enables hackers to crash their systems and forfeit matches, but it also sees unscrupulous users take control of direct messages and create untenable memory leaks (thanks, Vice).

Developer Supertrick Games says it's temporarily suspending the free-to-play game due to ongoing "challenges", saying that since launch, the game has been plagued with issues concerning "in-game matchmaking and lag". It plans to "redevelop" the game whilst it is offline. 

The service will go dark at 3am UK time on 18th July 2023, and no relaunch date has yet been confirmed. The team does, however, confirm that season 2's new content will release as planned, whilst season 3 will "only be partially released".

Well, she's only gone and done it. After three days and 199 tries, Malenia has been defeated - twice, simultaneously.


That's once with a controller, and once on a dance pad. At the same time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an inglorious end to his career at Manchester United and, perhaps, his national team Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo has left elite level football for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr and a contract reportedly worth up to €200m (£177m) a year. And with the move comes an inevitable - some would say long overdue - FIFA rating downgrade.


37-year-old Ronaldo, who for years had been one of the two best cards in the FIFA games alongside World Cup winner Lionel Messi, had already dropped three positions for the FIFA 23 top 10 with a 90-rated card. Now, after Ronaldo's poor performance at the World Cup and his move to the Saudi Pro League, EA has knocked Ronaldo down a further peg to his lowest rating since 2007, when the forward broke through at Manchester United.


Ronaldo's overall rating is now 88, two lower than the 90 he started FIFA 23 with back in September. Crucially, his specific stats are also lower. His dribbling, for example, is down to 81 from 84, his stamina down to 70 from 74.

Bay 12 Games' famously impenetrable simulation game launched on Steam on 6th December in spruced up form, with actual graphics as opposed to the text or "ASCII" graphics of the original version.


In a forum post, programmer and co-designer Tarn Adams declared Dwarf Fortress' Steam launch, which came after 16 years of free availability, a "wild success". Dwarf Fortress is also sitting on an "overwhelmingly positive" user review rating on Steam.

The game was released in a notoriously buggy state, particularly on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which led to a complaint filed in December 2020 that alleged the developer misled both customers and investors on how playable the game was.



Now, a federal judge in California has signed off on the settlement (thanks ArsTechnica), where everybody who acquired publicly traded CDPR shares throughout most of 2020 is eligible for settlement funds at roughly $0.49 per eligible share.

Ensuring the disruptions to your applications do not affect its availability isn't a simple
task. Last month's release of Kubernetes v1.26 lets you specify an unhealthy pod eviction policy
for PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs)
to help you maintain that availability during node management operations.
In this article, we will dive deeper into what modifications were introduced for PDBs to
give application owners greater flexibility in managing disruptions.
What problems does this solve?
API-initiated eviction of pods respects PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs). This means that a requested voluntary disruption

Based on the latest figures, the free-to-play game garnered a peak of 563,677 players today, making it the third most popular game on the platform. 


How does a brand-new indie game burst into the scene out of nowhere? Well in this case, we can attribute its success to the power of K-pop.

Block, who appeared in 2015's Need for Speed reboot and the Dirt series of games, sadly passed away earlier this week following a snowmobile accident on his ranch in Utah.


Following the news of his passing, fans gathered together to pay tribute to Block in one of the most fitting ways - by recreating some of the famous stunts from his hugely successful series of Gymkhana videos (thanks, PCGamesN).

That's according to Bloober Team's marketing chief Anna Jasińska in an interview with DreadXP.


Asked about the extent the studio was given free reign by Konami to transform the game with its own vision, Jasińska said: "We are focusing on bringing the distinct, visceral atmosphere back in the modernised Silent Hill 2. Longtime fans shouldn’t worry about us 'missing the point' while we’re livening up the title. We faithfully stick to the traditional story canon while remaking the gameplay and updating the graphics from the ground up."

Mortal Shell is a Dark-Souls inspired action RPG from Cold Symmetry, with the developer stating it will "test your sanity and resilience".

Shared as part of CES 2023, this trailer shows off the game with Nvidia's latest ray tracing tech in play. It's a bite-sized little teaser that begins with a few sweeping shots showing the destruction and destitution left in The Day Before's version of a post-pandemic America. 


It then cuts to scenes of the player character shooting down their enemies, engaging in stealthy trips into darkened rooms and along questionable corridors, and, of course, a swarming zombie horde. You can see it for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti graphics card goes on sale today, offering largely RTX 3090 to 3090 Ti level performance at $799 in the US and £799 in the UK. That's the narrative, anyway - but how many cards will actually be available at the MSRP/RRP? 
It's an important question, because as the old saying goes, there are no bad products, just bad prices. The RTX 4070 Ti is quite a strong option at $799, given its level of performance - particularly for those upgrading from Pascal (GTX 10-series) and Turing (20-series) GPUs or AMD's equivalents. At $899 or $999 though, this graphics card starts to make much less sense. 
And with no Founders Edition cards available, we're relying on third-party GPU makers to create SKUs that meet that price point - when it would be much more profitable for them to offer overclocked designs with oversized coolers and RGB bling for $50, $100 or $200 more. In fact, it's these sorts of cards that seem to have been sent out for review, including our unit which offered a paltry 30MHz overclock over stock - but came with a higher price tag to match.

The $7.7m lawsuit was filed last year due to a number of false copyright takedowns sent to Destiny 2 players in March. In June the perpetrator was identified as Nicholas Minor a.k.a Lord Nazo.




At the time, Bungie alleged that Minor launched a "malicious campaign to serve fraudulent takedown notices to some of the most prominent and passionate members of that fanbase, purportedly on Bungie's behalf, in apparent retaliation for Bungie enforcing its copyrights against material Minor uploaded to his own YouTube channel".

Smaller clubs like Wrexham aren't normally featured in FIFA, but the club entered the game in FIFA 22 in the "Rest of the World" category, likely due to the novelty of Reynolds and McElhenney being the new owners. 


Wrexham then returned for FIFA 23, only this time, players have found some trash talk from Reynolds and McElhenney from the benches.

This latest update video is truly a sight to behold. Along with the Post Boxers, it also introduces us to another bot out for our blood - the Naval Walker. This is a sentient (in so much as it walks around at its own free will) mine that will chase you down. There are different types of these walkers throughout the mod, with the paint on each denoting which kind you are dealing with.

        <updated>2023-01-05T12:18:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD has announced a raft of new Ryzen processors at its CES 2023 showcase, including the long-awaited Ryzen 7000X3D processors that should provide a stern rejoinder to Intel's 13th-gen desktop CPUs and could let Team Red reclaim the gaming performance crown. 
The idea here is pretty simple: take the '3D V-Cache' technology that made AMD's last-gen Ryzen 7 5800X3D so fast that it challenged even next-gen flagship CPUs, and pair it with some of AMD's fastest Ryzen 7000 processors. The result is three new chips, the Ryzen 7800X3D, Ryzen 7900X3D and the Ryzen 7950X3D. All three come with dramatically increased cache sizes - 104MB of L2 and L3 cache on the Ryzen 7 and up to 144MB on the Ryzen 9 - which minimise the time CPUs spend waiting for data to be copied into the cache, increasing performance considerably in some games. 
In AMD-provided benchmarks, the 7800X3D was between 10 and 25 percent faster than the 5800X3D at 1080p in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Borderlands 3 and F1 22 - slightly less than I would have expected, given that the 7800X3D is also using DDR5 RAM versus the DDR4 on the 5800X3D. Perhaps a more interesting comparison is that of the 7950X3D against the 13900K, where AMD showed between a nine and 24 percent performance lead in Watchdogs Legion, Dota 2, Rainbow Six Siege and Horizon Zero Dawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asus has announced an officially licensed Xbox controller with a built-in OLED display and tri-mode connectivity.


The ROG Raikiri Pro is the first licenced Xbox controller with such connectivity, allowing players to connect to devices via Bluetooth, low-latency 2.4GHz radio, or good old USB-C. This will be especially useful to players who game not just on Xbox or PC (with the relevant adaptor) at low latency, but also on other devices like smartphones or TVs.


The controller's tiny 1.3-inch display can display custom animations, battery life, or microphone status.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you who, like me, are quite partial to a live action video game adaptation, I am pleased to tell you we have been given a new look at Sony's upcoming Gran Turismo film.


This trailer covers a few behind the scenes shots that give us a closer look at how the film was made - things like cars rigged up with cameras left, right and centre. It also has some quotes from the film's actors, including Pirates of the Caribbean and Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom who has promised us all "body vibrating sound" that will mean viewers will feel "every jolt [and] every thrill" of the race on the film's release (which will be exclusively in theatres). 


Not that this film is going to solely focus on the cars, however. The cast has said there will be "heart-pounding action, drama [and] a love story" also woven into the script, that follows the true story of Jann Mardenborough.

This is despite the fact  Sony raised the price of the console in a number of territories in August. Sony also declared that the global console shortage is over. 


"Everyone who wants a PS5 should have a much easier time finding one at retailers globally, starting from this point forward," said PlayStation chief Jim Ryan.

It's a big boon for the new hardware, joining Horizon Call of the Mountain when it comes to first-party titles available for PSVR2 at launch. Racing games are a natural fit for virtual reality - it's been my preferred way to play ever since it became a viable option - and Gran Turismo 7 follows in the footsteps of Gran Turismo Sport which was supported by the original PSVR headset.


PlayStation VR2 is coming out on February 22nd, with units costing a cool £530. Here's everything you need to know about PSVR2, including its launch titles and full specs - and it's a device that Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton has been very enthusiastic about since trying it for himself.

The v1.25 release of Kubernetes introduced an alpha feature to change how a default StorageClass was assigned to a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
With the feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and PVC second to assign the class. Additionally, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned can be updated later.
This feature was graduated to beta in Kubernetes 1.26.
You can read retroactive default StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation for more details about how to use that,
or you can read on to learn about why the Kubernetes project is making this change.
Why did StorageClass assignment need improvements

Along with Pedro Pascal's Joel, we will see all the highs and lows these two characters go through on their perilous journey across America when the show makes its debut later this month. 


However, it turns out that before Ramsey landed the part of Ellie, fellow Game of Thrones alum Maisie Williams (who played Arya Stark) was in talks for the role back when the game was being pegged for a film adaptation.


Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann said the team needed to ensure that whoever was cast as Ellie in any adaptation would be able to appear "tough and vulnerable and wise beyond [their] years and also have a potential for violence" all at once.

This new image shows an abandoned cruise liner that, along with the rest of the world, has succumbed to the weather and decay of time. Its windows have been smashed, its hull has rusted - a far cry from its presumably once luxurious state. 


Along with this artwork, which you can see in full below, Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann stated the studio's upcoming multiplayer project is "shaping up to be a fresh, new experience". But while it may be fresh and new, Druckmann has said it will still be an experience "rooted in Naughty Dog's passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay".

It's widely known that the game was developed in under two years - an extremely short amount of time that led to huge pressure and Nintendo employees working overtime.

That's according to sources at Windows Central, who claim the game is targeting a release some time during the first week of the month.

<p>We have long known from Shor&#8217;s algorithm that factoring with a quantum computer is easy. But it takes a big quantum computer, on the orders of millions of qbits, to factor anything resembling the key sizes we use today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia just wrapped up its CES press conference, unveiling a new desktop graphics card - the RTX 4070 Ti - plus a lineup of RTX 40-series GPUs for laptops and a new RTX 4080 tier for its GeForce Now streaming service. Here's what you need to know.
First, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti. This is the renamed, repriced and now relaunched version of the RTX 4080 12GB that was so roundly derided upon its announcement that Nvidia 'unlaunched' the card soon thereafter. The key to that move was a feeling of confusion from gamers and press alike that the card was too distant in price and performance from the 4080 16GB, as it wasn't even based on the same AD103 chip. 
Now, the GPU seems more sensibly positioned - as a small improvement over the popular last-gen RTX 3080, with a price to match of $799. With DLSS 3 frame generation, it can be up to three times faster than the RTX 3090 Ti while consuming nearly half the power, although we look forward to putting those claims to the test. The latest Ada Lovelace card is scheduled to launch on January 5th, so we don't have too long to wait!

DLSS 3 is Nvidia's fancy graphics tech that uses AI to generate additional frames while keeping image quality and responsiveness up.

Pocket Card Jockey first launched on 3DS back in 2013, and is one of Game Freak's more successful non-Pokémon  games. An intriguing mash-up of horse racing and solitaire, it's gone on to earn cult status (though I recall Eurogamer's former in-house solitaire expert Oli Welsh being charmed but not wowed by this take on the form). 


Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! - spotted by our friends at VGC - is a buffed-up re-release for Apple Arcade,  with new 3D visuals for racing sections, and it's due out 20th January. It's got me wondering what other 3DS gems are ripe for being rescued by new ports - is it too much to hope for a re-release of Attack of the Friday Monsters?

Stuart's involment with the project was first announced back in 2021. However, speaking to Collider earlier this month, the screenwriter revealed he is no longer a showrunner on the adaptation due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives. 


"I think it was a little bit of a move of executives from LA to London, and it allowed the London group who, unfortunately, had to inherit my vision of what it was instead of getting to develop their own vision," Stuart explained to the publication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ken Block, star of Codemasters' Dirt series and a figure whose passion for motorsports helped push it to new audiences, has died at the age of 55 following a snowmobile accident on his ranch in Utah.

Block was an entrepreneur who co-founded DC Shoes in 1994, using his success to help pursue his automotive passions. In the 00s Block became a professional rally driver who went on to participate in the sport at its highest level in the WRC, though his results - with only a small handful of points and no podiums to show for his 24 appearances between 2007 and 2018 - don't reflect his true legacy as he popularised the sport through his hugely successful series of Gymkhana videos. 
WRC legend Sébastien Ogier led the many tributes to the great man. "Ken was a visionary, so passionate and inspiring," the eight-time WRC champion said on Twitter. "He knew like no other how to combine motorsport and a big show. He lived his life to the fullest and I'll never forget his smile and laugh."

Meanwhile, it is steadily ending support for a selection of its games, making the company's offerings a much leaner dish for consumers (and perhaps potential buyers?).


In his recent New Year's letter, Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda stated 2023 will be a year of "major evolution and transformation" for the company, with "multiple blockchain games based on original IPs under development" at this time. Some of these, Matsuda noted, have already been announced, while others will be unveiled at a later date.

Kubernetes v1.26, released last month, introduced an alpha feature that
lets you specify a data source for a PersistentVolumeClaim, even where the source
data belong to a different namespace.
With the new feature enabled, you specify a namespace in the dataSourceRef field of
a new PersistentVolumeClaim. Once Kubernetes checks that access is OK, the new
PersistentVolume can populate its data from the storage source specified in that other
namespace.
Before Kubernetes v1.26, provided your cluster had the AnyVolumeDataSource feature enabled,
you could already provision new volumes from a data source in the same
namespace.
However, that only worked for the data source in the same namespace,
therefore users couldn't provision a PersistentVolume with …]]></summary>

<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eavesdropping from the user&#8217;s smartphone is a well-known threat to the user&#8217;s safety and privacy. Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.26 includes significant advancements in network traffic engineering with the graduation of
two features (Service internal traffic policy support, and EndpointSlice terminating conditions) to GA,
and a third feature (Proxy terminating endpoints) to beta. The combination of these enhancements aims
to address short-comings in traffic engineering that people face today, and unlock new capabilities for the future.
Traffic Loss from Load Balancers During Rolling Updates
Prior to Kubernetes v1.26, clusters could experience loss of traffic
from Service load balancers during rolling updates when setting the externalTrafficPolicy field to Local.

The Kubernetes 1.26 release includes a stable implementation of the Job
controller that can reliably track a large amount of Jobs with high levels of
parallelism. SIG Apps
and WG Batch
have worked on this foundational improvement since Kubernetes 1.22. After
multiple iterations and scale verifications, this is now the default
implementation of the Job controller.
Paired with the Indexed completion mode,
the Job controller can handle massively parallel batch Jobs, supporting up to
100k concurrent Pods.
The new implementation also made possible the development of Pod failure policy,
which is in beta in the 1.26 release.
How do I use this feature?
To use Job tracking with finalizers, upgrade to Kubernetes 1.25 or newer and
create new Jobs. You can also use …]]></summary>

Remember when Nintendo released its first update for Mario Kart 7 in 10 years? Well, it turns out that was to address a critical exploit that "could allow an attacker to achieve full console takeover".

Whilst the issue was reportedly first noted back in 2021, PabloMK7, Rambo6Glaz, Fishguy6564 have been credited with the discovery of "ENLBufferPwn", an exploit so serious, it was given a critical score of 9.8/10 in the CVSS 3.1 calculator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka says that 2022 was "the biggest year in Sonic history" for fans of the blue blur.

But as well as referencing the game's movie sequel, Netflix show, and Sonic Origins and Sonic Frontiers - all of which dropped in 2022, of course - Iizuka teased that there was "a lot more outside of that" still to come, too.

"This past year was the biggest year in Sonic history, including the release of the movie sequel, new titles Sonic Origins and Sonic Frontiers, and the Netflix animation Sonic Prime," Sonic Team's Iizuka told Famitsu (thanks, Gematsu and Nintendo Life).

As well as the games developed by studios outside of China, 84 domestic games have also been given the green light in China, which Reuters calls "the world's largest gaming market".

Chinese megacorps like Tencent and NetEase are amongst those receiving approval, with the former reportedly securing licences for six of its games in December.

According to the Instagram account of PromoBricks - a Lego site that's successfully revealed unconfirmed Lego sets ahead of time before - the sets vary in size and complexity and will cost between $30 and $100 (that's £25 to £82, although the final localised price may differ).

Beyond that, however, not much else is known, but you can get a sneaky peek at what the sets may entail in the image shared by PromoBricks (thanks, VGC).

According to NHK and spotted by VGC, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office's Special Investigation Department have indicted Naka and Taisuke Sasaki for investing millions of yen in a company based on insider information that had yet to be made public.

The prosecutors allege that neither Naka nor Saskai would have invested the ¥144.7m if they hadn't known Square Enix was about to announce a partnership with a mobile developer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve's new Steam Replay feature is here with a handy summary of your 2022 PC playtime.

Just like PlayStation's annual Wrap-Up feature, Steam Replay tots up "all of your playtime between the first second of January 1 and the last second of December 14 (GMT)" - albeit only the games you've played whilst online; offline play and time spent "running tools" is not included - and presents it as a convenient infographic.

As well as a highlight panel that shows how much time you've spent on the games that have kept you busiest over the last 12 months (for me, it's been indie ghosthunting hit Phasmophobia), you also get a summary of your achievements - including the "rare" ones - and your longest streak, as well as data that lets you know how you compare with the rest of Steam's community.

In an interview with the New Yorker (thanks, Comicbook), Druckmann said he hoped that the show will "put that video-game curse to bed", although screenwriter Craig Mazin acknowledged that it's "not the highest bar in the world" to become a great adaptation given some games, like Assassin's Creed, have "impenetrable" storylines.

"I love the ability to wander, to do nothing, in Skyrim," Mazin said, before adding that "that is not translatable!" By contrast, however, he said that "The Last of Us was always a story where the story comes first".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has hit back at Sony's objection to its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard by revealing that third-party games like Bloodborne, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Final Fantasy 16, and Silent Hill 2 Remake are party to "exclusion" agreements that will prevent those games from coming to Xbox consoles.

The news comes as part of Microsoft's response to the FTC's lawsuit against its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In the filing, Microsoft defends its position by turning the spotlight back onto Sony, detailing a handful of "prominent" games the company alleges have been barred from release on Xbox.

Whilst the filing acknowledges that "exclusivity strategies are not uncommon in the games industry", Microsoft seems to take issue with Sony's partnerships with third-party publishers, namely From Software, Square Enix, and Konami.

Like many artists, senior artist Frank Aliberti - who currently works as a senior character artist at 2K but formerly worked for PlayStation Studios Visual Arts - has his credits listed on ArtStation. 

It's Aliberti's work with PlayStation Studios Visual Arts that's caught our collective attention, however, as Aliberti's most recent credit indicated that they had worked as a senior artist on Death Stranding 2.

The CPU Manager is a part of the kubelet, the Kubernetes node agent, which enables the user to allocate exclusive CPUs to containers.
Since Kubernetes v1.10, where it graduated to Beta, the CPU Manager proved itself reliable and
fulfilled its role of allocating exclusive CPUs to containers, so adoption has steadily grown making it a staple component of performance-critical
and low-latency setups. Over time, most changes were about bugfixes or internal refactoring, with the following noteworthy user-visible changes:

number of CPUs for system resources, including the kubelet itself, which will not be used for exclusive CPU allocation. Now it is possible to also

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author: Wei Huang (Apple), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google)
Kubernetes 1.26 introduced a new Pod feature: scheduling gates. In Kubernetes, scheduling gates
are keys that tell the scheduler when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.
What problem does it solve?
When a Pod is created, the scheduler will continuously attempt to find a node that fits it. This
infinite loop continues until the scheduler either finds a node for the Pod, or the Pod gets deleted.
Pods that remain unschedulable for long periods of time (e.g., ones that are blocked on some external event)
waste scheduling cycles. A scheduling cycle may take ≅20ms or more depending on the complexity of
the Pod's scheduling constraints. Therefore, at scale, those wasted cycles significantly impact the
scheduler's performance. See …]]></summary>

Now almost two months on, players fear the Valderas Museum will never return. Season One saw the return of fan favourite maps Shoothouse and Shipment, but players criticised the paltry number of maps released. One wonders why Infinity Ward hasn't released a map that is seemingly complete and ready to ship. 


But players have taken it upon themselves to answer this question. Some have noticed the map's striking resemblance to the real-life Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Meta Quest VR headsets, has agreed to pay $725m to settle a class-action lawsuit which accused the company of allowing Cambridge Analytica to access personal user data without consent. 


The Cambridge Analytica scandal goes all the way back to 2018, when former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie disclosed to The Guardian and The New York Times that the UK-based company had scraped extensive data from Facebook without the explicit consent of users. 


The scandal led to investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and the UK's Information Commissioner's Office issuing a £500,000 fine to Facebook (this was before the GDPR had come into force, which allows for significantly higher financial penalties) and the US' Federal Trade Commission issuing a $5bn fine.

The game's Steam page is now up and running.


The Division 2 launches on Steam nearly four years after it came out on PC and console in March 2019. Back then, Ubisoft's deal with Epic meant the PC versions of its games launched on the Epic Games Store as well as Ubisoft's own storefront, but not Steam, much to the annoyance of PC gamers.

That eye-watering figure came from Polyphony Digital CEO Kazunori Yamauchi as part of a message to fans to celebrate 25 years of the racing sim.


While Sony hasn't announced it as such, Gran Turismo is PlayStation's best-selling franchise. Much of that has to do with its longevity - there has been a Gran Turismo game on every PlayStation home console ever released.

The headline here is the addition of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, which came out in November 2019 and is set to get a sequel, Jedi Survivor, in March. The addition of Fallen Order to PS Plus Essential next month is well-timed in that context.


Elsewhere, Bethesda's online-focused RPG Fallout 76 joins PS Plus Essential next month (it's already in the PlayStation Plus Extra tier). Just yesterday we reported on how Fallout 76 has an impressive 13.5m players four years after its disastrous launch. I imagine joining PS Plus Essential will only fuel the player count.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing on with its season of giving, Epic Games Store is offering users the chance to get their hands on Lego Builder's Journey for free right now. 


This diorama puzzler from developer Light Brick Studio is yours to claim until tomorrow (22nd December) at 4pm. After that, Epic will unveil its next mystery giveaway.


I have personally never played Lego Builder's Journey, although it sounds right up my street. Our own Christian Donlan was quite enamoured with Lego Builder's Journey's breezy, tactile charms when he played through it, calling it "the perfect holiday treat" in his write up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 developer Raven Software has announced that the fan-favourite Loadout Drop has returned. 


Previously a legacy feature of the original Warzone, a Loadout Drop let players and their squad use custom-made loadouts rather than the weapons scavenged in the battle royale. 


While Loadout Drops would randomly spawn in the game world, buying a Loadout Drop grenade from a Buy Station would let you request a drop on demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More snippets of information about Star Wars Jedi Survivor are steadily being released, with the most recent of these shedding more light on combat, traversal, and a new face for the series. 


Speaking to Game Informer, director Stig Asmussen stated players will discover "five fully realised stances in the game" for protagonist Cal Kestis, including a dedicated dual blade option and Kylo Ren-esque crossguard-style lightsaber (both of which were glimpsed in the most recent gameplay trailer, which you can see below).


As you may already have assumed, Asmussen said it will be "advantageous to use certain types of stances against certain types of enemies". This, the director says, will require the player to "break down the enemies and figure out what the best weapon of choice is".

The two faced each other while playing for their respective national teams in the World Cup final on Sunday, with the result securing Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time. But it also brought on a headache for the young Mbappe who scored a hat-trick in the match. 


Now the two will fly back to Paris to play together once again, and some have wondered what the changing room talk might be like.

Reporting its half year results to 30th September 2022, the Paris-based company admitted any delays in the development of its four activities (gaming, hardware, licensing and blockchain), or underperformance in its initiatives may cause it to make less money than expected, and in turn spark "a liquidity shortfall and additional financing requirements".

The trailer in question (which I have seen) introduced an NPC known as Shaun. It was a playful set up that showed Shaun being interviewed about his work on Goat Simulator 3. 


Here he boasted about his impressive rag-dolling skills (he went to the "most prestigious rag-dolling school in the world", you see), and reflected that sometimes he just sits on a bench and ponders the world at large. All in all, some fairly inoffensive stuff.

In a hand-on preview, The Verge noticed that battery life was noticeably worse than the base DualSense controller, and this was later confirmed to the publication in a statement. 


"The DualSense Edge wireless controller's operating time is moderately shorter than the original DualSense wireless controller," a Sony spokesperson said. "We wanted to strike a good balance between wireless operating time and delivering robust, high-performance features."

According to the patch notes, the hotfix should "improve overall stability and performance of the game, and fix GOG & Steam overlays." 


Stability and performance improvements is of course the catch-all phrase used by developers to group a large number of small fixes, but we do know from reports of PC users that problems included framerate drops and slow texture loading.

Sundae Month and publisher Kitfox Games announced this news as part of Nintendo's House of Indies: Holiday Event yesterday, promising Switch owners that soon they will be able to use their photography skills to snap all the best shots of shibas, terriers, labs, pugs, and more. "You want 'em, WE GOT EM!" the Pupperazzi team proclaimed.


But it is not just taking pictures. Along with getting nice photos of your canine compatriots, you will also be able to play fetch with them, dress them up in a variety of outfits, have a dance party (or should that be paw-ty) with them and "terrorise them with vacuum cleaners" (but would you really want to do that?). You can even see them in action at the skatepark - in fact, Pupperazzi's entire world is populated with dogs, dogs and yet more dogs. You can see what I mean in the trailer below.

Squanch Games and Justin Roiland's effort is now the most popular game in Microsoft's subscription - in both its PC and console catalogues. 


On Xbox consoles, more people are playing High on Life through Game Pass than other popular titles such as Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, FIFA 22 and Rainbow Six Siege. Indeed, it is currently being played by more people than any first-party Microsoft release, including Minecraft, Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite and Sea of Thieves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A major new study from UK consumer group Which? has found evidence that the Nintendo Switch's infamous Joy-Con drift is likely caused by a mechanical fault, pointing to fundamental design flaws.


The research found that the Joy-Con's plastic circuit boards showed noticeable wear on the joystick slider contact points, despite only being used for months. It is this wear that ultimately results in drifting. 


In addition, dust and other contaminants were found in the Switch's internal components, despite attempts by Nintendo at dustproofing said areas.

In Kubernetes 1.26, the 1st alpha release of validating admission policies is

Validating admission policies use the Common Expression
Language (CEL) to offer a declarative,
in-process alternative to validating admission
webhooks.
CEL was first introduced to Kubernetes for the Validation rules for
CustomResourceDefinitions.
This enhancement expands the use of CEL in Kubernetes to support a far wider
range of admission use cases.
Admission webhooks can be burdensome to develop and operate. Webhook developers
must implement and maintain a webhook binary to handle admission requests. Also,
admission webhooks are complex to operate. Each webhook must be deployed,
monitored and have a well defined upgrade and rollback plan. To make matte…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Federal Trade Commission has hit Fortnite maker Epic Games with a record-breaking penalty of $520m (£427m) over allegations it previously employed "lax privacy practices" for voice and text chat, and used design tricks to "dupe millions of players" into unintentional purchases. 


The eye-opening judgment includes the largest-ever settlement obtained by the FTC regarding the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, as Fortnite allowed in-game chat and user data collection by default. 


Fortnite holds a "Teen" rating by the US ratings board ESRB, but the FTC has argued Epic Games knew many of its users were likely under 13 years of age and had not obtained their parents' consent.

The entire tournament was simulated inside FIFA 23, which outputted Argentina as the ultimate winners, with Lionel Messi winning the Golden Boot and Emi Martínez winning the Golden Glove awards. The predictions were published November 8th, long before the tournament had started. 


The game's ability to predict the winner for the fourth time in a row is a testament to the accuracy of FIFA's official rankings, but of course the uncertainty of the real world means that not everything was predicted correctly.

FIFA games have now taken the Christmas top spot 10 times since sales records began back in 1984, making it the most popular Christmas number one franchise (versus Call of Duty's nine Christmas chart toppers).

With the recent release of Kubernetes v1.26, Device Manager is now generally

"Soar through the skies aboard a majestic warbird, engage in epic aerial dogfights, and take on the role of Falconeer, a powerful airborne warrior traversing a vast world torn apart by generations of poisonous decisions and dissent, through a new and unique perspective."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Microsoft is considering introducing cheaper, ad-supported tiers of its Xbox Game Pass.

That's according to a survey Microsoft recently circulated to players, inviting views about the current Xbox Game Pass subscription and querying if we'd be willing to accept adverts if the subscription payment was lower.

An unsourced screenshot, written in Spanish and shared on ResetEra (via VGC), alleges that Microsoft is surveying players and exploring a tier-like system - similar to that of Ubisoft+ and Sony's PS Plus - by inviting them to "consider hypothetical subscriptions".

Ubisoft has been pretty quiet about the game so far, and even the name remains under wraps for now. But that hasn't stopped the studio from putting out a public call to players, inviting them to join the playtest team.

"Be part of something great," the studio teases on its sign-up page. "Nothing beats the feeling of being part of the creation of a completely new game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta's VR consulting CTO, John Carmack, is leaving the company after "a decade in VR", accusing the firm of "self-sabotage".

In an internal note seen by Business Insider, Carmack criticised the company's "efficiency", adding that despite Quest 2 being "almost exactly what [he] wanted to see" with its "mobile hardware, inside out tracking, optional PC streaming, 4K(ish) software", he was "offended" at seeing a "5 per cent GPU utilisation number in production".

"We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort," Carmack - who co-created the Doom and Quake franchises - said in the leaked memo. "There is no way to sugarcoat this; I think our organisation is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playtest footage reportedly taken from Assassin's Creed Jade has leaked online.

Allegedly posted to an Assassin's Creed Facebook page and then, in turn, shared with Assassin's Creed and Gaming Leaks and Rumours on Reddit, the footage - which runs for 2.40 mins - was seemingly captured on an Apple mobile device and depicts a combat-heavy sequence, which includes cut-scenes and combat tutorials. You can watch it here. 

Whilst it's not the first we've seen of Jade - Ubisoft dropped a polished teaser earlier this year - it is the first time we've seen raw footage like this (thanks, TheGamer). As always, you can't necessarily expect the final product to look and/or play this way - this is likely a very, very early version of the game - and, as always, if you're interested, you should probably check it out sooner rather than later: these things have a habit of disappearing within a day or two.

In an interview with NME, Schafer revealed that when he started making games back in the '80s, there was "a lot less sensitivity" around, but between developing 2005's Psychonauts and its 2021 sequel, he'd "learned a lot" and was "thinking about how [his] art will be interpreted by the viewer".

"I thought I'd learned a lot, and then we tested a game, and people pointed out a word and asked if we knew what this word means to certain people," the Schafer said. "I had no idea – and people will criticise that and say 'woke culture, PC police' and stuff – but for any art, I'm thinking about how my art will be interpreted by the viewer.

As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Criterion's vice president and general manager Matt Webster has left the studio after 23 years, as has head of studio development and 17-year Criterion veteran Alan McDairmant.


They're joined by senior technical director Andrei Shires, who has been with the company for 16 years, as well as executive producer Pete Lake, who first joined Criterion in 1996. Head of content Steve Uphill also leaves following his most recent 10-year stint at Criterion. All are said to have left the developer to "explore new opportunities outside of EA".
