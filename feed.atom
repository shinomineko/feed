The news came courtesy of Take-Two's recent Q1 2022 earnings call (thanks, Resetera). Nestled at the bottom of a slide called "Pipeline Details (as of 18th May, 2021)", the company said it had six "new iterations of previously released titles" in development.
Three were specified and already public knowledge - Grand Theft Auto 5: Expanded and Enhanced and Kerbal Space Program for current-gen systems, plus a standalone version GTA 5's fan-favourite Grand Theft Auto Online - but three remain unknown.

"Insurgency Sandstorm is coming to PS4 and Xbox!" Maximum Games UK - a self-described "boutique" publisher - announced on Twitter. "Engage in realistic modern firefights in the definitive tactical FPS! Battle in the war-torn environments of a contemporary conflict through a series of cooperative and multiplayer modes."
Interestingly, the tweet itself doesn't give a release date and the brief video teaser included in the tweet only hints at a "2021" release, but the pre-order link takes us to UK games retailer GAME, and it's here the specific date is given.

Respawn's Travis Nordin told participants in a Reddit AMA that while the Legend had "brought a lot of new gameplay elements to the game", Seer's particular skillset is "a bit too strong".
As Emma explained earlier this week, complaints about how Seer's abilities give him too much of an advantage in combat were piling up on the Apex subreddit. Many of these complaints are centred on Seer's microdrones, which allows him to disrupt revives and shield battery regens.

Since leaving early access back in 2015, Kerbal Space Program has remained in active development, receiving numerous updates and expansions along the way - there's even a free "next-gen" update for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S due this autumn. However, Squad has now confirmed - after warning players the space flight sim's 1.12 update would be its last major release back in June - that its decade-plus-long journey is officially at an end.

They can be entered via a "moonpool" using a submarine (another new item that we'll get to later). The labs also have CCTV to help you plan your route, along with microphones that let you "broadcast your commands into the entire base's network". 
Some labs even come with mess hall rooms that allow you to play high-stakes poker, or barbecue meat while listening to music with your pals. That all sounds relaxing, but there are also plenty of nefarious NPCs on board that want to spoil your day - best stay on your toes. You'll find some tasty loot if you make it past these puzzles and enemies, so perhaps the reward is worth the risk.

The friendly Bear Hug emote went on sale last night, priced 200 V-Bucks, ahead of this weekend's huge Ariana Grande concert series. It's a synced emote, which means other players can interact with someone performing it. 
But players quickly found the emote was a bit too friendly. Epic Games has now removed the emote from sale.

The Premier League club sued Football Manager publisher Sega in May last year, 16 years after the release of Sports Interactive's first Football Manager game, and 28 years after the launch of the first Championship Manager game.
Manchester United had launched legal action against Sega and Sports Interactive for infringing its trademark.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> A master face is a face image that passes face-based identity-authentication for a large portion of the population. These faces can be used to impersonate, with a high probability of success, any user, without having access to any user-information. We optimize these faces, by using an evolutionary algorithm in the latent embedding space of the StyleGAN face generator. Multiple evolutionary strategies are compared, and we propose a novel approach that employs a neural network in order to direct the search in the direction of promising samples, without adding fitness evaluations. The results we present demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a high coverage of the population (over 40%) with less than 10 master faces, for three leading deep face recognition systems...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

This apparently happened sometime in July, and appears to have something to do with Krafton's plans to create a PUBG universe.

What is Server-side Apply?
Server-side Apply helps users and controllers manage their resources through declarative configurations. Server-side Apply replaces the client side apply feature implemented by “kubectl apply” with a server-side implementation, permitting use by tools/clients other than kubectl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saber Interactive's Evil Dead game will no longer release this year as originally planned, and is now targeting a PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC launch in February 2022.
Evil Dead: The Game casts players as familiar faces from all across the Evil Dead franchise, bringing them together in co-operative union to battle the forces of darkness - chainsaws (and other assorted melee and ranged weapons) in hand. Adding an extra wrinkle to the core co-op action is a PvP component in which another player becomes the Kandarian Demon itself, able to roam the map in a bid to thwart the humans' plans.
According to the gameplay trailer released earlier this year, human players will need hunt down pages of the Necronomicon, Raymond Knowby's tapes, and other artefacts in order to cast the spell needed to vanquish the demon and win a match, all of which sounds very much in the Dead by Daylight/Friday the 13th: The Game mold.

And if you missed them, you'll find everything gathered up into one convenient digest below.
Adam Robinson-Yu's much-loved open-world exploration game A Short Hike, in which a small bird goes on a brief but thoroughly delightful mountain-climbing adventure, is coming to PlayStation consoles some time this autumn. We liked this one a lot when it released for PC back in 2019 - Christian Donlan called it "dreamy brilliance" in his Essential review - so it's definitely one to keep an eye out for.
Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, the sequel to developer Night School Studio's deliciously eerie 2016 narrative adventure, is also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation consoles. It's set to feature an "entirely new" cast of characters - players control Riley Poverly as she investigates strange electromagnetic signals in her home town of Camena - while retaining, as Night School puts  it, "the weird, heartfelt, and personalised experience of the original". Previous word suggested Oxenfree 2 will launch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's "mass multiplayer outdoor extreme sports game" Riders Republic will begin its previously announced beta later this month on 23rd August.
Riders Republic is something of a spiritual successor to Ubisoft's under-appreciated winter sports effort Steep, but while that game focussed exclusively on snowy pursuits, Riders Republic encompasses a broader range of activities, including biking and wing suit action (both vanilla and jet-powered) alongside skiing and snowboarding.
Players can experience Riders Republic's world - which is stitched together from seven iconic US national parks: Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Grand Teton, Mammoth Mountain, Sequoia Park, Yosemite Valley, and Zion - both solo and co-operatively. However, Ubisoft is heavily pushing the game's large-scale competitions, which include races with upward of 50 players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go's most high profile players have called upon developer Niantic to reconsider its decision to remove the game's extended interaction range, which was implemented last year as the pandemic hit. 
Influencers, YouTubers and community leaders have today used their sizable social media footprints to all share an open letter to Niantic setting out the reasons why they believe the game's extended interaction distance should remain, several days after it was reverted in the US and New Zealand. 
The list of reasons includes being able to play while further socially distanced, and keeping the game extra accessible for less able players. Other reasons listed include being able to play further away from the general public for personal safety reasons, and further away from businesses or landmarks to avoid congestion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a new Apex Legend in town, but Seer might be bringing a little too much firepower to the table - as Apex Legends players are complaining that his abilities are too powerful. Some are even comparing his abilities to "wallhacks", and many are calling for the character to be nerfed. 
Over on the Apex Legends subreddit, complaints are piling in about how Seer's abilities stack up to give him too much of an advantage in combat. Many of these complaints are centred on Seer's microdrones - and the fact they're seemingly the Swiss army knife of Legend abilities. Not only does the tactical ability do damage, it also reveals enemy locations (including health bars) and interrupts actions such as healing.
While Seer's tactical does take some time to travel, players have found that it has a surprisingly large hitbox, as you can see from the experiment below... and the poor soul hiding inside a building who got caught out by the ability. It's also a seemingly unstoppable force that can go through mountains.

The change is part of a wider programme to introduce local pricing relative to the cost of living and exchange rates in every region.  
Under the existing pricing structure, UK subscribers were paying approximately $7 USD per sub, significantly higher than the $4.99 paid by Americans. The new price is therefore much fairer to subscribers outside the United States.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bold move that certainly didn't pay off, a pair of PlayStation 5 development kits appeared on eBay yesterday - although the listings didn't last more than a few hours before being removed. 
As spotted by Twitter user iDCx1337, the listings were for a DFI-D1000AA dev kit and a DFI-T1000AA test kit (thanks, Kotaku). A screenshot of the DFI-D1000AA dev kit, complete with two all-black DualSense controllers, showed that the listing apparently reached a bidding price of €2850 (£2423) before being pulled.   
It remains unclear whether eBay decided to remove the listings or whether Sony got involved, but either way, the listings apparently only survived a few hours before they mysteriously vanished. We still don't know how the seller got their hands on these kits: dev kits are normally given out to developers under strict NDA. It seems these two have somehow managed to trickle down into the hands of someone who was willing to take a punt on an eBay listing.

And for those wanting to dress for the occasion, Mediatonic has added two birthday cosmetics to the in-game store - a special body suit, emblazoned with cakes, balloons, and the like, plus a fetching birthday crown. They can be purchased for a meagre 10 Kudos each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon's massively multiplayer online title New World has been delayed again but this time only by around a month, with the game now expected to launch on PC on 28th September.
Announcing New World's fourth delay in a statement posted to Twitter, Amazon Game Studios wrote, "We are humbled by the support New World received from players around the world throughout closed beta. During beta, more than a million adventurers played more than 16 million total hours... The passion and enthusiasm you've shown for New World validates the work we've put in over the past year, improving the game based on your feedback". 
"We want New World's launch to be a smooth and fun experience for all players," the studio continued, "and that means making some improvements based on what you encountered during closed beta. So we're going to take a few extra weeks to smash bugs, improve stability, and polish the game." This, it says, means a new global launch date of 28th September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Games shows might be lacking some of their old-time bombast since the pandemic forced a shift to digital-only presentations, but there's no denying the continuing thrill of a flashy announcement show. And we now have firm details of the next biggie as Geoff Keighley prepares his Keighleymobile and readies to ride out for Gamescom's Opening Night Live.
This year's Opening Night Live marks the third annual outing for the show since its debut back in 2019, and the second time it'll be taking the form of a digital-only event. It'll be held on Wednesday 25th August, slightly later than previously announced, and we now know exactly when we'll be expected to grasp snacks and take our seats as things get underway.
As confirmed by Keighley, who'll once again be presenting, over on Twitter, the 2021 showcase will run for two hours, with proceedings kicking off at an entirely reasonable 7pm in the UK/11am PT. There's no mention of a pre-show yet, but last year's started half an hour before the main event, so if you just can't resist a good old-fashioned pre-ample, you might want to block out a bit more time in your diary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever heard of Blackpink? If not, well, a lot of people sure have - the band was the first K-pop girl group to reach 1bn views on YouTube, and they're currently the most subscribed-to music group on the platform (via Vogue UK). And now the group is coming to PUBG with their very own crossover event. 
Between 18th August to 7th September players will be able to participate in "special in-game event missions" to earn points to acquire Blackpink-themed items, including a level three helmet and contraband coupons. And there's plenty more in-game items where that came from: 35 distinct items will be on sale in total, and will be purchasable from today until the end of the year. Each of the band members will have their own cosmetic bundles (each of which includes "themed hair, an outfit, a nameplate, helmet, weapon and emote"). 
PUBG's maps will also see some changes as part of the event. Blackpink-themed decorations such as building decals, plane banners, supply crates and level three helmets will appear from today until 7th September on PC, and from 12th August to 15th September on consoles.

        <updated>2021-08-04T14:06:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the vanilla version of Cyberpunk 2077, you may find yourself wearing some absurd clothing combinations just for the sake of your armour stat. Bucket hats and high heels, biking boots and pencil skirts - it all goes on just to increase that number. What you wear in Night City doesn't have much of an impact on your interactions with others, but one modder has introduced a system to make clothes more meaningful.  
StreetStyle - Immersive Fashion System adds more depth to Cyberpunk's existing clothing system by tying your outfits to the game's skill checks. The PC mod gives each item of clothing specific skill bonuses in Strength, Reflexes, Technical, Intelligence and Cool (with a value between one and five for each category). These combine with your base stats to give you skill boosts that comes in handy for skill checks - such as those found in dialogue and device interactions. Items have been assigned stats according to their actual purpose: wearing Netrunning equipment, for instance, will boost your Intelligence stat - but it won't provide much help with Strength and Reflexes, as the suits are not designed for combat.   
You can't simply boost your stats into the stratosphere, too: StreetStyle also adjusts the difficulty of skill checks to prevent them from being too easy with the buffs. The mod calculates your clothing bonus by adding up the total of all your clothing items for a single attribute, then dividing that number by seven, and adding it to your base stat.

Yesterday, as Activision Blizzard executives such as boss Bobby Kotick insisted "we will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry" during a financial call aimed at the investor community, a coalition of workers from across multiple Activision Blizzard studios criticised the decision to hire WilmerHale, the same law firm helping Amazon keep its workers from unionising, to review the company.
As reported by IGN, the employees, collectively called the ABK Workers Alliance, said Kotick did not "meaningfully address" workers' demands following last week's high-profile employee walkout.

As reported by Kotaku, the update's new reputation system has a huge rank cap of 1000 and reaching the higher levels takes a lot of time. The only way to earn RP is through Tuner races, testing out new cards, and passively by walking around the car meet. 
Players have figured out the passive RP method can be exploited easily. As long as they can keep their character moving around in the car meet, they won't be booted from a server for inactivity and can get on with something else in the real world.

"True Directional Movement - Modernised Third Person Gameplay" is a mod by Ershin for Skyrim: Special Edition on PC that, well, does exactly what it says on the tin. The mod overhauls Skyrim's third-person gameplay to allow you to move and attack from any direction, while there's also a target lock component to help you keep track of enemies. This target lock comes with an animated health bar widget above enemies, with bosses getting their own (much larger) health bars. 
Here's a demonstration of what all this looks like in practice:

In April of this year, the Kubernetes release cadence was officially changed from four to three releases yearly. This is the first longer-cycle release related to that change. As the Kubernetes project matures, the number of enhancements per cycle grows. This means more work, from version to version, for the contributor community and Release Engineering team, and it can put pressure on the end-user community to stay up-to-date with releases containing increasingly more…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick, along with a number of other senior executives, has spoken again as the company remains embroiled in controversy following the recent California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, discrimination, and a "frat boy" work culture at Blizzard.
Addressing investors during Activision Blizzard's Q2 2021 results call this evening, Kotick said, "I want to start by making clear to everyone that there's no place in our company where discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment of any kind will be tolerated. Nowhere.
"We so appreciate the current and former employees who've come forward in past recent days with courage and I want to reiterate the commitments we've made to you. Our work environment, everywhere we operate, will not permit discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment. We will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Left 4 Dead 2's iconic survivor line-up is embarking on another undead adventure, this time appearing as playable characters in developer Rebellion's Zombie Army 4: Dead War.
Coach, Ellis, Nick, and Rochelle - who debuted in Valve's seminal co-operative FPS sequel all the way back in 2009 (and who finally returned to action in 2020's official The Last Stand update) - come to Zombie Army 4 as part of Rebellion's free Left 4 Dead Character Pack 2, available now on all platforms. They follow the original Left 4 Dead's cast, who joined Zombie Army 4 as playable characters earlier this year.
The new group's arrival coincides with Zombie Army 4's Season 3 finale, which wraps up its current storyline in new campaign mission Return to Hell. "Our intrepid squad [are thrust] back into the underworld," teases Rebellion, "but this time it is a haunted manifestation of Schweiger's mind which they must survive in order to free him from Baron Umbra."

Art of Rally, which initially launched on PC toward the end of last year, delivers a top-down, faintly retro twist on the rally racing formula, sending players careening across low-poly renditions of Finland, Germany, Japan, Norway, and Sardinia as they tackle its 60 rally stages.
It features 61 "iconic" rally cars from the 60s to the 80s, and includes daily and weekly leaderboard challenges, ghost racing, and more alongside its sizeable career mode - all unfolding to the beat of Art of Rally's delicious, 80s-hued synth soundtrack.

Players of Ubisoft's competitive multiplayer shooter have complained they are constantly joining matches where other players are exploiting the way the game works in Japan to farm for in-game currency.
This in-game currency, known as Renown, is earned primarily by completing matches. You can also earn some extra Renown from daily challenges and from Ubisoft Connect, which is Ubisoft's cross-platform social and loyalty hub. Players use Renown to unlock operators, weapon attachments and customisation items.

"The Wayward Realms is set on a group of over one hundred islands, ranging from small to massive, known collectively as the Archipelago, where scores of factions vie for influence and power," says the official game description.

Addressing questions about the game in a Twitter thread, Konami asked itself: "is early autumn launch basically a demo?"
"In many ways, yes," Konami said. "We want people to get hands-on with eFootball as soon as possible, so we will launch with a limited number of teams and modes. Exact details to follow."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Take-Two says it'll be announcing an "exciting new franchise" later this month with a release planned before the end of the current fiscal year in March 2022. 
The news (as spotted by VGC) comes via Take-Two's Q1 2022 earnings call and follows pre-E3 leaks earlier this year - corroborated by VentureBeat's Jeff Grubb - revealing two new unannounced games from the publisher.
Mafia 3 studio Hangar 13 is said to be working on a title described as "Cthulhu meets Saints Row" while XCOM developer Firaxis is reportedly creating a Marvel-themed turn-based strategy game. And while Take-Two offered no hint as to nature of its "new franchise" in its earnings call, this month's Gamescom digital event seems a likely candidate for a full reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If it's story you want with your Battlefield 2042 now that Dice has confirmed there won't be a single-player campaign this time around, your next best thing might very well be arriving in the form of an official short film tie-in set to debut next week.
Dice announced the existence of its new "standalone" cinematic short, titled Exodus, over on Twitter earlier today, revealing the mini-movie will detail the events that ultimately "trigger an all-out war" within the universe of 2042.
As Eurogamer's Martin Robinson explained earlier this year, despite Battlefield 2042 eschewing a solo campaign to focus on multiplayer, it does still play out against a narrative backdrop: a humanitarian crisis brought about by climate change, where nomadic refugees known as No-Pats take up arms as the United States and Russia engage in "all-out war".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another month means a fresh batch of additions to Sony's PlayStation Now service, with August's offerings now confirmed to be Nier: Automata, Ghostrunner, and Undertale.
Nier: Automata is probably the biggest eye-catcher, providing another opportunity to experience developer Platinum Games' celebrated action-RPG. Creator Yoko Taro's second Nier outing - which follows the dystopian travails of androids 2B and 9S - is as richly atmospheric and dizzyingly inventive as its predecessor, mixing Platinum's tried-and-tested hack-and-slash action with ample genre-busting surprises as its layers are gradually revealed.
"Those searching for an endlessly imaginative dreamlike journey," wrote Jeffrey Matulef in his Recommended review, "will find Nier: Automata too mesmerising to look away from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To usher in Black Panther's arrival on 16th August, Marvel's Avengers is having a free trial weekend on Steam, PlayStation, and Stadia. It kicked off on 29th July and ends later today, 1st August, sending interest in the action game on PC soaring.
Looking at SteamDB (thanks, TheGamer), the game usually averages around only a few hundred concurrent users at a time, but the freeplay event has set a 24-hour peak of 10,161 players - with 10,121 online right now at the time of writing.
It doesn't quite hit the heights of its launch period - Marvel's Avengers peaked at almost 32,000 Steam players when it released last September - but it's a considerable spike for a game that had hitherto struggled to get even 1000 simultaneous PC players online.

As noted by SteamDB (thanks, PCGN), the collection comes from Filip Victor and is "not Valve related", but Tyler McVicker - who focuses on news about Valve and Steam - reports that the remaster has "Valve's consent".
It's apparently the next iteration of the fantastic mod Half-Life 2: Update, a "completely free and extensive community-developed update for Half-Life 2 featuring beautiful lighting, countless bug fixes, and a brand new Community Commentary Mode". It's available to anyone who owns Half-Life 2 on PC and offers "countless" bug fixes in "one free standalone download".

That's not the only thing getting Halo fans excited, though. The advertisement has some people speculating that the ad has solidified Halo Infinite's vague "Q4 2021" release window, too, teasing: "Why wait for November?"

The statistic came courtesy of Conor Ford, who manages Apex security at developer Respawn. They confirmed that of the 2086 players banned on 29th July 2021, 1965 had been playing on PS4, 62 on Xbox, 44 on PC, and 15 on Nintendo Switch.
The ban hammer primarily targeted players caught "dashboarding", players who forcefully shut down the game at the end of a losing match to avoid losing RP. By abusing it, players can erroneously maintain their high-rank status but thankfully, Respawn noticed the trend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 14 developer Square Enix has revealed it will redesign the logo for new job sage following fan feedback that for some, it triggered their trypophobia - a phobia of holes.
Taking to the official website to explain the changes, Final Fantasy 14's producer and director Naoki Yoshida said that the team didn't think the job's icon was a "particularly big" deal, but soon "received feedback from players all over the world" that the icon "made them uncomfortable or fearful".
"This aversion is known as trypophobia, and those who have it feel disgust and fear when they see clusters of small holes or bumps," Yoshida explained (thanks, PC Gamer). "The severity of the reaction varies between people, and what triggers it in some may not do so in others.

Halo Infinite is the franchise's first foray into the world of multiplayer bots, and developer 343 is using the technical preview to gather feedback on bot behaviour and online performance. To that end, the technical preview debuted with the Bot Arena playlist, which puts four players against four bots on arena maps.
The technical preview launched with bots that felt pretty easy, and last night I won every game against them. But while I slept, 343 pushed an update that added ODST difficulty bots and a new map, Recharge. And I am here to report these ODST bots are not messing about.

The Ascent, published by Curve Digital and developed by Neon Giant, came out this week (check out our review to see what we thought) on PC and Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S, with a day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass.
Players soon discovered the Game Pass version lacks some of the graphics features of the Steam version. Specifically, the Game Pass version does not support Nvidia's DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) tech, and ray tracing simply doesn't work.

More than 2000 current and former Activision Blizzard employees signed a petition calling the company's response to the recent discrimination lawsuit "abhorrent and insulting".
Activision Blizzard's initial public comment on the lawsuit was to strongly deny its claims. An email then sent to staff by Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend, who was the assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism to George W. Bush from 2004 to 2008, has been heavily criticised by staff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horizon Forbidden West, the highly anticipated follow-up to Guerrilla Games' acclaimed open-world action-adventure Horizon Zero Dawn, has reportedly been delayed into 2022.
Announced last summer, Horizon Forbidden West was originally set to launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5 toward the end of this year; however, Sony hinted a slip might be possible back it June, when it announced God of War: Ragnarok would now be a 2022 title. "We think we are on track to release [Horizon Forbidden West] this holiday season," said PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst at the time, "But that isn't quite certain yet, and we're working as hard as we can to confirm that to you as soon as we can."
Hints that Sony was now leaning toward delaying Horizon Forbidden West's release into next year first surfaced yesterday, courtesy of GameBeat journalist Jeff Grubb, who suggested the company was still "undecided" on the matter during his Giant Bomb show. However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has now weighed in with the more definite statement that "Sony has delayed the PlayStation exclusive... to the first quarter of 2022", according to his source.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Icarus, the sci-fi survival game from DayZ creator Dean Hall, will no longer launch on 11th August as originally announced and is now expected to arrive some time this November.
Icarus (now a full-price release after developer RocketWerkz pivoted away from its initial free-to-play plans) casts players as deep-space prospectors attempting to salvage what they can from the surface of a hostile alien planet following a terraforming disaster.
"Icarus was once destined to be a second Earth," explains the game's Steam page, "but when terraforming collapsed, the air turned toxic and humanity's hopes of colonising a new world died... Yet when xeno-biologists discovered the cause of the failure - exotic matter - new interest was ignited. Valuable beyond reckoning, these 'exotics' sparked a gold rush, fuelling political tensions on Earth, and bringing prospectors flocking to Icarus."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've all been there - chests overflowing with gold, rubies on the floor, amber pearls somehow floating around in your food storage. And not a merchant in sight to help you spend it all. But the upcoming Hearth and Home update for Valheim should help with your treasure storage problems, as it's due to add a bunch of shiny new items to help you create your own bank vault.
As explained in a blog post, the developers at Iron Gate are now returning from their summer holidays to continue work on Hearth and Home, which is the first major update for Valheim since its launch. The team are apparently still on track to deliver the update "this very quarter", so we shouldn't have to wait much longer to see all the delicious goodies arriving in the patch (like Eyescream, Shocklate Smoothies and the ominously-named "wolf meats"). 
This update isn't just about food, however, and you'll soon be able to create your very own treasure trove. Coin stacks and coin piles will be added as items that can be crafted from your excess gold. If you don't want it all on display, you can store your bling in a special treasure chest. And if you want to secure all your earnings, you might want to craft the new iron gate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what appears to be a world first, a Twitch streamer has completed a blindfolded speedrun of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Yep, you read that right. 
Earlier this week streamer Mitchriz completed Sekiro's Shura ending with a time of four hours, 35 minutes and 13 seconds, all while blindfolded. Here's a clip of the moment he completed the run - spoilers for the final boss, obviously:
It's worth watching the rest of the run, too, as it's fascinating to see how Mitchriz navigates Sekiro's world using only audio cues. (Rather conveniently, he also has an input overlay so you can see what he's doing with his mouse and keyboard.) On sections near cliff edges, Mitchriz has to carefully count down the seconds to measure how far he's walking in any one direction, often darting forwards to help control his movements. On some occasions Mitchriz slashes with a sword until he hits a wall, with the change in sound indicating his position. Grapple points seem to serve as useful tools for navigation, while enemy sounds and cutscenes also help telegraph his position.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Cloud photo services are widely used for persistent, convenient, and often free photo storage, which is especially useful for mobile devices. As users store more and more photos in the cloud, significant privacy concerns arise because even a single compromise of a user&#8217;s credentials give attackers unfettered access to all of the user&#8217;s photos. We have created Easy Secure Photos (ESP) to enable users to protect their photos on cloud photo services such as Google Photos. ESP introduces a new client-side encryption architecture that includes a novel format-preserving image encryption algorithm, an encrypted thumbnail display mechanism, and a usable key management system. ESP encrypts image data such that the result is still a standard format image like JPEG that is compatible with cloud photo services. ESP efficiently generates and displays encrypted thumbnails for fast and easy browsing of photo galleries from trusted user devices. ESP&#8217;s key management makes it simple to authorize multiple user devices to view encrypted image content via a process similar to device pairing, but using the cloud photo service as a QR code communication channel. We have implemented ESP in a popular Android photos app for use with Google Photos and demonstrate that it is easy to use and provides encryption functionality transparently to users, maintains good interactive performance and image quality while providing strong privacy guarantees, and retains the sharing and storage benefits of Google Photos without any changes to the cloud service...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

On Wednesday, nearly 500 current and former Ubisoft employees (we understand this figure is now over 1000) across 32 studios, signed an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard staff following a recent lawsuit that called the World of Warcraft and Overwatch studio "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women".
The letter slammed Ubisoft leadership's "empty promises" in response to allegations of "systemic discrimination, harassment and bullying" within the company, and proposed an industry wide collaboration to agree a set of "rules and processes for handling reports of these offences".

It's mostly just marketing points, but it does provide the first brief snippets of gameplay throughout that give us an idea of how the game will look on PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series consoles. 
The focal point of FIFA 22 is what EA calls HyperMotion Technology, which combines full-team mocap data and machine learning. The idea is to make player movement feel more fluid and natural. This has led to 4000 new animations in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine's gorgeous sci-fi action-adventure Solar Ash finally has a release date and will be heading to PlayStation and PC on 26th October.
Announced back in 2019 under the working title Solar Ash Kingdom, Heart Machine's latest adventure takes players to a "surreal, vivid and highly stylised world filled with mystery, wild high-speed traversal, endearing characters, and massive enemy encounters" as they, in the role of Voidrunner Rei, attempt to save their home planet from the Ultravoid - a massive black hole that swallows entire worlds.
In more practical terms, Solar Ash (which trades Hyper Light Drifter's intricate top-down pixel art for a fully 3D world) is a third-person action-platformer with a focus on "fluidity of movement". Players are able to quickly leap, slide, grind, and grapple across huge distances as they explore the likes of sunken cities, vast water shelves, and dangerous lava zones, battling ever-more fearsome enemies along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Asobo Studio's wonderful, rat-infested medieval stealth adventure A Plague Tale: Innocence will be free on the Epic Games Store starting next Thursday, 5th August.
A Plague Tale unfolds in a bleak, but gorgeously wrought, version of 14th century France, and follows the harrowing journey of Amicia and her sickly 5-year-old brother Hugo, the children of a nobleman, after they're forced to flee their home in an attempt to escape the Inquisition.
What follows is a brilliantly engaging single-player adventure - primarily built around simple stealth and dual-character puzzling - that sees players evading ravenous rat hordes, English soldiers, and other perils as they traipse across the desolate, plague-ridden landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix and developer Crystal Dynamics' troubled superhero action romp Marvel's Avengers expands next month with the long-awaited arrival of new playable hero Black Panther, coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Stadia on 16th August.
Black Panther is the third new playable hero to be added to the game since its launch last year, and follows the arrival of two distinct Hawkeye incarnations in the form of Kate Bishop and Clint Barton. Just like his predecessors, Black Panther is a free addition to Marvel's Avengers and will be accompanied by his own story campaign.
War for Wakanda, as the campaign is known, focusses on current Black Panther and ruler of Wakanda, King T'Challa. "Blindsided by a betrayal and the resulting tragedy," teases Square Enix, "T'Challa finds it difficult to entrust his duty to anyone else, even his sister Shuri... When arch-villain Klaw's forces threaten Wakanda's safety, T'Challa must take the fight right to them to defend everything and everyone he holds dear."

Last week's story quest saw players aiding the anthropomorphic tree in a series of missions to raise an alien hatchling and restore peace with the invaders - all part of the game's current UFO season storyline. 
The quest appeared to end in success - until today, when Bushranger is no longer available to find on the game's island map as an NPC, and instead there's a small grave marked in his usual spot with some flowers.

The key change has been fixing so-called "ghost hits", where players feel like they lose vehicle health for no apparent reason. This tends to happen when other players are close by but appear to not make contact. 
Developer Lucid Games believes this is caused by latency issues, and has "worked on a new set of parameters between the game and the servers which should help keep everyone in sync a bit better than it had previously".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not every day a mod wins a national writing award, but the quality of the story in Skyrim mod The Forgotten City was enough to see it pick up an Australian Writers' Guild Award back in 2016. The mod was downloaded over 3m times, and it's now taken on a new form, as the mod has been transformed into a standalone game. 
The Forgotten City released yesterday on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It's been updated with professional voice acting, new gameplay mechanics, a new orchestral score and a significant overhaul of the original script. "If you liked the mod, you're going to love the standalone game," says the Steam description. "We've taken the best elements of the mod, re-written the script, which is now more than twice the length of the original at 80k+ words, and added plenty of exciting new twists, endings, and surprises."
In terms of gameplay, The Forgotten City is a murder mystery game set in a cursed Roman city where "if one person sins, everyone dies". Players must explore, question characters and exploit a time loop in order to solve the mystery. Combat is an option, but apparently this will only get you so far. There are moral dilemmas, multiple endings and opportunities to roleplay - all in a city filled with historically authentic Roman "art, architecture, costumes and customs".

With Kubernetes 1.22 due out next week, now is a great time to look back on 1.21. The release team for that version was led by Nabarun Pal from VMware.
Back in April I interviewed Nabarun on the weekly Kubernetes Podcast from Google; the latest in a series of release lead conversations that started back with 1.11, not long after the show started back in 2018.
In these interviews we learn a little about the release, but also about the process behind it, and the story behind the person chosen to lead it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 500 current and former Ubisoft employees have signed an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard staff following a recent lawsuit that called the World of Warcraft and Overwatch studio "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". The letter also slams Ubisoft leadership's "empty promises" in response to allegations of "systemic discrimination, harassment and bullying" within the company, and proposes an industry wide collaboration to agree a set of "rules and processes for handling reports of these offences".
Addressing Activision Blizzard staff, the open letter, shared by Axios reporter Stephen Totilo on Twitter, begins, "We hear you and want to loudly declare our solidarity with you. Over the past week, the games industry has once again been rocked by revelations that have long been known by too many of us. Revelations that a year ago many were hearing about Ubisoft."
"It is clear, from the frequency of these reports," the letter continues, "that there is a widespread and deeply ingrained culture of abusive behaviours within the industry. It should no longer be a surprise to anyone: employees, executives, journalists, or fans that these heinous acts are going on. It is time to stop being shocked. We must demand real steps be taken to prevent them. Those responsible must be held accountable for their actions."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Organisers of today's staff walkout at Activision Blizzard are pressing ahead with the protest, saying the statement released by company boss Bobby Kotick overnight "fails to address critical elements at the heart of the employee concerns".
Activision Blizzard employees announced strike action last night, in protest against the company's response to a recent lawsuit from California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing which alleged a "frat boy" work culture that created "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women".
Activision immediately went on the defensive, calling the lawsuit "irresponsible behaviour from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State's best businesses out of California". Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend later doubled down on the attack in an email to all employees, calling the lawsuit "truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tokyo 2020 Olympic opening ceremony featured a suite of video game music - including tracks from Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts and Sonic the Hedgehog - but one publisher was notably missing from the lineup. Where was Nintendo? According to leaked documents, it seems that there were once plans for the publisher to be more involved with the opening ceremony, with Nintendo songs included in the soundtrack and various Mario-themed shenanigans. 
The news comes via Japanese media outlet Shukan Bunshun, which has obtained several documents for the opening ceremony ranging from April 2020 to July this year. According to these plans, the event would have featured performances inspired by the "8-bit world of video games" including Super Mario and Space Invaders, overseen by Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto. 
One composition plan dated 4th October 2020 featured a proposal that would have seen the return of the warp pipes from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics closing ceremony... with something of a twist. One graphic shows Lady Gaga entering a pipe, only to re-emerge as comedian Naomi Watanabe (sporting a blonde wig and red cap).

Darksiders 3 will become available for Games with Gold subscribers to claim from 1st to 31st August. Yooka-Laylee will then be available from 16th August to 15th September. 
"Playtonic's tribute to Banjo is a gentle, irreverent platformer let down by spotty handling and a slight shortage of genius," Edwin wrote of Yooka-Laylee in Eurogamer's review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Picross is already amazing, but what could make an amazing thing even amazing-ier? I'll tell you what: giving it all a big 'ol Master System and Mega Drive themed makeover and then hurling the whole nostalgia-tweaking package onto Switch next week, on 5th August.
Picross S Mega Drive & Master System Edition (known as Picross S Genesis & Master System Edition in the US for obvious reasons) is an official collaboration between Sega and developer Jupiter, the team behind the long-running, and consistently brilliant, puzzle series.
Once again, the meat of the game involves filling in little squares on a grid - using the numerical clues above and beside each column and row for pointers - until you've successfully managed to create a picture. This time, though, players are working toward creating final images that conjure characters from a total of 59 classic Sega games (and to musical accompaniment from each), some of which are revealed in the announcement trailer below.

Offices will be split between San Diego and Los Angeles, with talent from Bungie and EA also on board. Don't expect to see what the team's working on anytime soon, though - the announcement comes as part of a recruitment drive, with That's No Moon looking to ramp up to 100 staff in 2022.

Completing the contract rewards you with three rewards. First, the Scarlet Suit, a red snakeskin suit complemented by matching driving gloves and sunglasses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month PUBG was given a major update with the introduction of new map Taego and a Gulag-style second chance system, but there are yet more surprises in store - with multi-care packages, a secret room and... burning planes... all being added in the latest update. 
The patch notes for update 13.1 for PC are now live, and detail changes for both Taego and the wider game. Possibly the most dramatic addition is a feature called the "emergency landing plane", which will definitely keep players on their toes at the start of a match. Instead of the usual calm flight above the battlegrounds, this plane starts hurtling towards the ground - while on fire - and any players who remain on board until the end of the journey will take 50 percent damage. It travels faster than the normal plane, and has a varied fall height, so you'll need to jump at the start of the journey if you want to glide further across the map. 
"Stay alert and pay attention to the flight crew's instructions, as not every flight is an easy one," the patch notes say. You don't have to tell me twice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK is a weird place, London most of all. For example, Westminster City Council spent £2m commissioning a new hill (no, I'm serious) near Marble Arch that opened on Monday. 
For the low price of £8, people with too much money to spend can climb the 25-metre-tall structure to have a prime view of, err, Oxford Street and Hyde Park, I guess. 
However, this waste of taxpayer money might just be a money-maker as a Mario-themed attraction. As Nintendo Life points out, people have been comparing the hill for its uncanny resemblance to Super Mario 64's Bob-Omb Battlefield. Others have compared it to Minecraft or a PlayStation One game.

The mobile match-3 puzzler launched in July 2019 and has been kept well updated with new stages and characters. But in-game purchases have now been switched off, and the game will become completely unplayable from 1st November.
After that date, Nintendo says it will memorialise the game and your play history via "Dr. Mario World Memories", a web page it will put up after pulling the game down.

"Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf," Kotick said in an open letter to company staff that was made public last night.
"It is imperative that we acknowledge all perspectives and experiences and respect the feelings of those who have been mistreated in any way. I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard employees are planning a walkout tomorrow, 28th July, in protest against the company's response to a recent lawsuit from California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging a "frat boy" work culture that created "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women".
Activision was quick to slam the lawsuit, strongly denying its claims and dismissing it as "irresponsible behaviour from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State's best businesses out of California".
That was a stance repeated in an email reportedly disseminated by Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend, who insisted the lawsuit "presented a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old, and out of context stories". Townshead continued, "Rest assured that leadership is committed to continuing to maintain a safe, fair, and inclusive workplace. We cannot let egregious actions of others, and a truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit, damage our culture of respect and equal opportunity for all employees."

"As more people started using Quest 2," Facebook explained in its recall notice on the Oculus website, "we received reports that a very small percentage of Quest 2 customers were experiencing skin irritation after using the Quest 2 removable foam facial interface. We've been working hard to address the issue, working with experts and making adjustments to our manufacturing process, and communicating proactively with regulators."
Facebook initially announced it was investigating reports of skin irritation from Quest 2 last December, and provided an update on its findings back in April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Rise continues its schedule of crossover updates on Switch this Friday, 30th July, as Amaterasu, star of Capcom's beloved action-adventure classic Okami, joins the game.
More specifically, Monster Hunter Rise players will be able to acquire Amaterasu in the form of a unlockable layered armour set for their Palamute, and there's a little more to the outfit than a mere skin swap. With the Amaterasu armour equipped, Palamutes won't just resemble the beloved Okami character, they'll bound across the landscape leaving a trail of blooming flowers and leaves in their wake, as is befitting of a Sun Goddess.
As yet, Capcom hasn't specified what, exactly, players will need to go up against to obtain the new layered armour set, but expect a similar format to June's collaboration (which added a Palico skin themed around Monster Hunter Stories 2's Felyne Tsukino), meaning players will need to farm materials from a new event quest included as part of the update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Draknek & Friends' acclaimed puzzler A Monster's Expedition is heading to Switch next Thursday, 5th August, and a "major" free expansion comes to all platforms the same day.
A Monster's Expedition initially launched for Steam and Apple Arcade at the tail-end of last year, sending players on a wonderfully relaxing open-world puzzle adventure - in the role of the titular monster - that predominantly involves rolling logs around small, awkwardly shaped landmasses, Sokoban-style, to form bridges and access new islands.
A few more wrinkles are added along the way, of course, often leading to some ingenious head scratchers, but A Monster's Expedition has such a natural charm, it never frustrates. "There's no tension, no forced direction," wrote Chris Tapsell in his Essential review last year, "just curiosity and momentum and a reward that feels, at times, like a welcome embrace."

For some context, one of the biggest mysteries of Bloodborne is a locked door hidden behind the Cleric Beast, the first boss you are likely to encounter. But the door is inaccessible in the final version of the game: it's just a static door asset.
However, in the alpha demo build, it's possible to interact with the door from the inside. The infamous Bloodborne modder Lance McDonald showed that the door was meant to lead to a pathway which served as a shortcut between Central Yharnam and the Cathedral Ward.

Back in June 2020, Creative Assembly said this exclusivity and the free giveaway was a one-off deal for Troy, and there were no plans for future games to be Epic exclusives. The deal was about reaching a new audience, which clearly worked out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've already heard a little about new Apex Legend Seer's abilities, but some existing characters are also getting a rejig in upcoming season Emergence, with both Caustic and Fuse due to get some buffs. 
As explained by Gamespot, Caustic's gas will no longer deal a flat five ticks of damage per second. Instead, it will increase in damage every other second: for instance, causing 5,5,6,6,7,7 points of damage, with no limit on how much it can increase. Balancing this out, however, the gas cloud created by Caustic's Nox Gas Grenade will disappear five seconds faster. 
Fuse is getting some even more significant (and much-needed) improvements, with his Knuckle Cluster lasting twice as long, and his Motherlode ability now highlighting enemies. Any enemy caught in the blast will be highlighted, even if they are hidden behind a building or wall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal Crossing: New Horizons will receive further free content later this year, Nintendo has said, thanking fans for their patience during a particularly dry spell for updates.
There are no details on how big these updates may be or what features they may contain. There is no word of Brewster. But, I suppose, it is something. 
A small update arrives this Thursday, 29th July, meanwhile. This adds another smattering of seasonal items and brings back the game's previous August fireworks.

The open letter, first reported by Bloomberg (paywall), hits out at the company's response to the lawsuit filed last week by California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which alleges multiple female employees were subjected to gender discrimination, sexual harassment and unequal pay.
According to CNN, this letter now has over 2000 signatories - a number that is expected to grow in the coming days.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Delivering malware covertly and detection-evadingly is critical to advanced malware campaigns. In this paper, we present a method that delivers malware covertly and detection-evadingly through neural network models. Neural network models are poorly explainable and have a good generalization ability. By embedding malware into the neurons, malware can be delivered covertly with minor or even no impact on the performance of neural networks. Meanwhile, since the structure of the neural network models remains unchanged, they can pass the security scan of antivirus engines. Experiments show that 36.9MB of malware can be embedded into a 178MB-AlexNet model within 1% accuracy loss, and no suspicious are raised by antivirus engines in VirusTotal, which verifies the feasibility of this method. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks becomes a forwarding trend of malware. We hope this work could provide a referenceable scenario for the defense on neural network-assisted attacks...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Shared in a blog post on Xbox Wire, the screenshots (and brief video clips) provide a nice look at Forza Horizon 5's 11 "distinct and unique biomes". Seasons will return with Forza Horizon 5, and each of these 11 biomes will transition through the seasons differently: spring will bring the rainy season to the farmland and jungles, for instance, while summer might bring tropical storms to the coast. All on a map that's about one-and-a-half times the size of Forza Horizon 4. 
"We knew from the beginning that we wanted this to be the biggest Forza Horizon yet. However, if we wanted to be the biggest, then we felt we also needed to offer the most diversity and contrast as well," said creative director Mike Brown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The makers of a 14-year-old Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas mod have pulled it offline themselves over a fear of a takedown from Take-Two.
GTA United is a mod based on San Andreas for PC. It unites the maps of Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto Vice City in one game area within San Andreas, effectively replacing San Andreas' map.
Work on the free, non-commercial mod began in 2006. The first beta of what was then known as "Vice City 2 San Andreas" came out in early 2007. The beta for "Liberty City 2 San Andreas" came out soon after. Then, in late 2007, the beta for a combined effort called GTA United was released. Five years later, in December 2012, GTA United 1.2 was released. It remained available ever since - until now.

Reddit user taegukie theorises that this conversation was meant to happen in the "Finding Strings" flashback, where Joel talks about the Savage Starlight comic he's been reading. 
Here's the full transcript: Joel: "So I noticed that her, uh, hologram... Map thing... It's a moth. Was that where your tattoo came from?" Ellie: "Ugh... Maybe?... Judgy." Joel: "I ain't judging. Just Curious." Ellie: "Liar!" Joel: "Well, like I said, I ain't judging... I think the moth is pretty."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On 13th July, Red Dead Online received an update called Blood Money that added a number of features to the game (such as new clothing, passes and missions), but it seemingly changed something rather unexpected under the hood. The game's horses have been acting a little strange, and in some cases, are now causing terrible accidents by colliding with players. Perhaps this is all an unofficial sequel to Spirit.  
As spotted by Kotaku, players have taken to social media to discuss the strange horse behaviour and share footage of the bugs. There are seemingly just a lot of player horses roaming through Red Dead Online, with players speculating that the horses are being left behind once players leave the lobby. Others suspect that the culprit could be a horse-cloning bug that occurs when the player enters a stable. There have even been reports of players finding AI clones of their own characters. 
In any case, the abundance of horses is causing mayhem, with players colliding with the rogue horses and being sent flying from their own saddles. Rather more tragically, some of the player horses are simply being found dead.

With all Kubernetes APIs, there is a process to creating, maintaining, and
ultimately deprecating them once they become GA. The networking.k8s.io API group is no
different. The upcoming Kubernetes 1.22 release will remove several deprecated APIs
that are relevant to networking:
the networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version of IngressClass
all beta versions of Ingress: extensions/v1beta1 and networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
On a v1.22 Kubernetes cluster, you'll be able to access Ingress and IngressClass
objects through the stable (v1) APIs, but access via their beta APIs won't be possible.
This change has been in

The filing - which was reportedly submitted on 21st July 2021, according to a Redditor who's keeping a close eye on the situation - has secured the European trademark up until 1st October 2028. Though little else is available on the trademark application's webpage, it's still logged as "goods and services", and categorised as "computer game software".
Though there's presently no official confirmation either way that Sony might be looking to relaunch Home - or at least some kind of version of it - it's the third such rumour to have surfaced in as many months, leading some to think it may have something to do with "a return to PSVR 2" (thanks, Comic Book) that would dovetail nicely into large-scale social events, such as those we've seen in Fortnite. Add in VR compatibility, and it could be a very exciting development indeed.

While all we can do is chalk this up as an unsubstantiated rumour for now, the screencap - shared via CriptAssassINI (thanks, NME) - certainly looks convincing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has clarified what the company means by describing the Steam Deck as "targeting 30 FPS".
Though some prospective Steam Deckers were concerned at the use of the word "targeting", Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais took to Twitter to emphasise that the hardware wasn't targeting 30 FPS as much as it was suggesting 30 FPS is the minimum Steam Deck users can expect.
All the games that have been tested on Steam Deck thus far have reportedly "consistently met and exceeded" 30 FPS, plus there'll also be an optional FPS limiter to enable players to choose between framerates and prolonging the mobile device's battery life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the 1990s, Iraqi programmer and designer Auday Hussein worked on an Amiga adaptation of the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest surviving work of literature. He was kind enough to talk me through this amazing project earlier this year, discussing his first experiments with the MSX and Amiga, what it was like learning about programming in Baghdad during the rule of the Ba'ath Party, the challenges of visualising the Gilgamesh universe, and the possibility of releasing the partly completed game today.
Hussein also shared a video of the game, which now has the working title "Kingdom of Death". It's a beautiful and atmospheric action-adventure set in the underworld, with a wonderful monster bestiary and thoughtful puzzles tied to cuneiform inscriptions. You can read much more in the full feature, but here's the video by itself if you'd rather cut to the chase.
An excerpt from the article, for context: "It's a 2D platform adventure with a musclebound, sword-wielding hero, a vast menagerie of monsters and intricate, cavernous environments. It takes inspiration from a multitude of non-Mesopotamian sources, including Shadow of the Beast, Zelda and David Joiner's 1987 RPG Fairy Tale Adventure, and is "more free, more open" than the Gilgamesh narrative, with puzzles that pull you deeper into the setting."

The free-to-play sci-fi competitive multiplayer shooter, which has been described as "Halo meets Portal", launched an open crossplay beta on 13th July. This let PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One players all play with and against each other for the first time.
Splitgate has been knocking around on PC since May 2019 with a relatively small player base, but the crossplay beta sparked an explosion of popularity (to the tune of half a million downloads) that caused severe server problems. So severe, in fact, that developer 1047 Games was forced to take the beta offline.

The original Jurassic World Evolution, which released in 2018, was an atmospheric, if ultimately rather shallow take on the classic theme park management sim formula, tasking players with building and maintaining their own dinosaur wonderland by laying out exhibits, tending to visitors needs, and researching new amenities - all while ensure the attractions didn't rampage.
Frontier has already teased a few of the new features coming to Jurassic World Evolution 2 later this year, but its inaugural developer diary video goes a little deeper into some of the elements its hoping will convince punters to delve into their wallets a second time around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Book, the Slavic-folklore-inspired dark RPG adventure from developer Morteshka, now has a release date and will be coming to Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 10th August.
Morteshka - which also developed the similarly striking, Finno-Ugric-inspired The Mooseman - describes Black Book as a "fusion of card-based RPGs and adventure games", playing out against a bleakly beautiful rendition of 19th century rural Eastern Europe.
Players take on the role of Vasilisa - a young witch with the ability to control demons, still reeling from the death of her betrothed - and must set out in search of the legendary Black Book, said to have the power to grant one wish to those that locate its seven seals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a feature that Red Dead Online players have requested almost since the game's launch, but the ability to purchase properties in Red Dead Redemption 2 - aside from the Moonshiner role - has sadly remained a distant dream. While the feature is yet to appear in the game's online mode, modders have stepped in to finally introduce a properties system to the single-player version of the game on PC: so you can now choose your own little house on the prairie. One without Uncle constantly complaining about lumbago.
The Buyable Properties mod was released by modders Bolmin and "Dick Hertz" last week, and provides players with a selection of purchasable hotel rooms and cabins. It's a mod intended for use in the game's epilogue map, and serves as a useful way to spend all your leftover epilogue cash. You can even decorate your house with a variety of interior and exterior upgrades - check out the video below for a demonstration (but spoilers, obviously, for the end of Red Dead Redemption 2's story):
There are three customisable houses to choose from (based in the Heartlands, near Strawberry and near Rhodes), which are marked on the map with a little "house to buy" sign. While you can have a nap in the houses and use some of the items stored in them, their functionality is a little limited at present - although there are apparently plans to add weapon lockers in the next update. If you want something a little fancier, there's always the hotel room option, which this mod allows you to buy permanently.

The lawsuit includes a number of disturbing allegations and alleges a culture of "constant sexual harassment" mainly at Blizzard Entertainment, the maker of World of Warcraft, Diablo and Overwatch.

A number of new job listings have been posted on Respawn's website, with creative director Mohammad Alavi describing the project as a "brand new Respawn single-player adventure". Details on the game remain light, but the postings do note that the project is "in its early stages", while the single-player title is apparently "a designer's dream playground with a freedom to innovate made possible by the unique universe it inhabits."
According to a tweet in April by Respawn developer Steven Kah Hien Wong, the team is building a new IP "from scratch". So before you start asking about Titanfall 3 again, it seems like this is something brand new.

According to the article, the map "features a mix of both tight corridors and more open outdoor areas, leading to a blend of close-quarters combat while still leaving the door open for the likes of Widowmaker to excel from afar".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[January 2020 saw the arrival of Blizzard's highly anticipated Warcraft 3 remake, Reforged, but the celebratory mood quickly soured once fans realised the game failed to deliver much of what was initially promised and took away even more. Now, a report from Bloomberg has shed new light on the behind-the-scenes decision-making that lead to such a disastrous outing for one of Blizzard's most beloved games.
When Reforged was originally announced at BlizzCon 2018, Blizzard sold it as a significant overhaul of its classic real-time strategy game. However, the final version was plagued by bugs, brought broken online play, and was absent of expected features promised in its initial reveal, including improved cutscenes and re-recorded voice overs. It even stripped out elements from the original Warcraft 3, such as leaderboards and clans.
So significant was the negative response to Reforged, Blizzard eventually implemented an on-request refund policy, but the question remained why the company thought it was even remotely acceptable to ship a product in such an shoddy state to begin with.

This is not via a separate standalone Football Manager game - rather, it is via complete integration into the mainline Football Manager.
The addition of women's football won't make it into FM22, Sports Interactive boss Miles Jacobson told Eurogamer in an interview today. But women's football is coming - and could be added to FM post-launch in the middle of its year-long life cycle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 14's producer and director Naoki Yoshida has told players they "don't need to show so much restraint [they] stop having fun" following his request they make a few concessions to accomodate newcomers while Square continues to addresses server issues caused by a sudden surge in the MMO's popularity.
A record number of players have flocked to the now-decade-old MMO in recent times (Steam saw an all-time peak of 67,019 concurrent players earlier this week), and while that's undoubtedly boon for the long-term health of the game, the sheer number of people wanting to get involved has caused serious server congestion, resulting in lengthy queue times and players being unable to create new characters.
On Tuesday, Yoshida apologised to Final Fantasy 14 players for the ongoing technical woes, assuring them Square is doing everything it can to improve matters. A recently released patch has implemented an automatic logout for AFK players as an "emergency measure to combat congestion", for instance, and login caps have been raised on North American servers.

The original Dead Space launched back in 2008, sending players, in the role of engineer Isaac Clarke, on a terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura, its crew slaughtered by nightmarish creatures known as the necromorphs.
What followed was a deliciously atmospheric third-person horror adventure that saw players embarking on the mother of all fixer-uppers in order to reactive the ship and locate Isaac's missing partner Nicole, engaging lasers to sever innumerable necromorph limbs along the way.

During this evening's EA Play event, game director Chad Grenier discussed Seer's abilities, describing him as similar to Bloodhound and "all about tracking enemies". Aiming down the sights will bring up a heartbeat sensor that will hint at an enemy's location. His tactical, meanwhile, sends drones out of his chest to reveal and track an enemy's location. Seer's ultimate also makes use of his microdrones, using them to create a sphere that senses enemies who move through it.  
For those who are concerned Seer may be a little bit too similar to Bloodhound, Grenier assured players that the new legend is more about stealth, and is able to gather "precise and lingering information".

The details come via a now-deleted article on Game Rant, which revealed maps from Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 3 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 will feature, alongside the armies and factions from those games and a selection of their arsenal. Players will be able to mix and match elements - so it's possible, it's said, to pit WW2 soldiers against Battlefield 2042's all-new specialists. 
Players will be able to adjust settings, and there's also mention of an in-depth logic editor which allows more granular adjustments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battlefield fans have spotted the return of a classic map buried in a teaser video that plays when players boot up one of the current Battlefield games.
YouTube creator VickeP first spotted an image in the teaser that looked awfully familiar. He captured the frames of the video that showed the clearest view of the image and stuck it into Photoshop to produce the clearest image. It showed what appears to be huts and powerlines:
He shared the image on reddit, where people noticed the image looked like Battlefield Bad Company 2's map Valparaiso. Vicke then compared the image to gameplay footage of Valpariso and found an exact match. This really is a reflection of just how amazing the collective power of gaming communities can be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of super-person pile-ons and animated stuff are in luck; developer Netherrealm's acclaimed superhero fighting series Injustice: Gods Among Us is getting the animated movie treatment courtesy of DC and Warner Bros. Animation.
That's according to the Hollywood Reporter, which says the film - to be released under the DC Animated Movie banner - will draw inspiration from Netherrealm's video game titles as well as writer Tom Taylor's Injustice: Gods Among Us: Year One, a comic book prequel to the games.
Its animated action will reportedly unfold on an alternate version of Earth where the Joker has successfully managed to trick Superman into killing Lois Lane, sending the superhero on a rampage of destruction. "This unhinged Superman decides to take control of Earth for its own good," says the Hollywood Reporter, "leading Batman and his allies to attempt to stop him."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday saw the beta launch of Amazon's much-delayed MMO New World, and early gameplay reports have been generally positive. Considerably less, positive, however, are the increasing number of posts from players saying that New World has also successfully managed to brick their pricey RTX 3090s graphics cards - an issue Amazon has now gone some way to acknowledging on its official support forum.
Word of New World's potentially hardware-busting abilities first surfaced on the MMO's dedicated sub-reddit. "I just bricked a 3090 in the main menu after setting my graphics quality to medium and hitting save," wrote user greyone78. "Cant believe it. Anyone else had a catastrophic failure like this?".
Multiple responses seem to confirm that, yes, this isn't an isolated issue, and further reports of RTX 3090 malfunctions after playing New World (primarily seeming to impact cards made by EVGA) began to spread to Twitter and beyond, along with speculation the problem may be the result of power spikes and overheating caused by uncapped frame rates in the game's menus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot going on in the world of The Witcher over on Netflix, with the streaming service currently working on three separate projects based on author Andrzej Sapkowski much-loved fantasy novels. First out of the gate, though, is animated movie The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, and it's just received its first proper trailer ahead of its launch on 23rd August.
Nightmare of the Wolf, which was announced at the start of last year, is a prequel to Netflix's main live-action show and focusses on Geralt of Rivia's friend and mentor Vesemir, "long before" the two meet. Indeed, it'll supposedly hurtle back in time to the start of Vesemir's journey as a Witcher, "after the mysterious Deglan claims him through the Law of Surprise".
Netflix offered a brief glimpse of Nightmare of the Wolf earlier this month, but the streaming service has now given Witcher fans a more substantial look at the movie in its first proper trailer, in which a dashing Vesemir flirts, quips, and slays his way to adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go Fest 2021 earned £15.4m ($21m) in two days, according to numbers from app store analytics firm Sensor Tower. 
The Saturday of last weekend's ticketed event was one of the most lucrative days for the game since its stratospheric launch in July 2016, though was just pipped by the one-day Kanto Tour event earlier this year. (Across the weekend, Go Fest was still the clear winner.)
Pokémon Go recently passed the $5bn lifetime player spending total, and in 2021 has notched up $731m so far - putting it on track for this year to be its most profitable yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poor old Saitama - not only is he having problems getting people to recognise him for his abilities, but now the servers for his game are set to shut down. 
Bandai Namco announced the news in a tweet, explaining that the multiplayer servers for One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows will go offline on 28th February next year. Offline game modes and "online 1v1 game matches" will still be playable, but that's the end of the fighting game's online multiplayer modes. 
One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows is a 3D arena fighting game based on the One Punch manga and anime. It was released on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 28th February 2020, meaning the online servers will close after exactly two years of life. The game received mixed reviews from players on Steam, and according to SteamDB only ever reached a peak of 586 concurrent players - with only five people playing when I checked this afternoon. I guess the game's title was, er, suitable.

This was discovered after Valve employee austinp_valve responded to a question in the Steam Big Picture forum about the future of the interface. 
Big Picture was released in 2012 as a console-like interface for users who plugged their PCs into large monitors and tv while using a controller as opposed to keyboard and mouse. It became the basis for SteamOS which was used for the ill-fated Steam Machines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news for Fallout 76 building enthusiasts, as Bethesda is bringing custom servers to the game, allowing you to remove CAMP building limits and construct a home wherever your heart desires. If you're paying for a Fallout 1st subscription, that is. 
Fallout Worlds is a new system that's set to arrive in the live game this September, and it's already been rolled out to Fallout 76's public test server. It includes a feature called Custom Worlds, which allows players to tweak world rules such as where CAMPs can be placed, the permitted size of CAMPs, or whether "free building" is allowed. Which basically sounds like a creative mode.
It seems there are some options for PvP players, too: the combat section of the world settings allows players to tweak the difficulty of the world, such as the AP cost of using VATS and Melee. There's also an option to turn on infinite ammo, so you could essentially turn Fallout 76 into your own personal paintball game.

PUBG developer Krafton Inc. has announced it's working on an animated "project" based on the popular battle royale title in conjunction with Adi Shankar, who served as producer and showrunner on Netflix's acclaimed Castlevania adaptation and is the creator of the streaming service's upcoming Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix animated series.
"As a player, I've been crushing the competition in the Battlegrounds since PUBG released in 2017," Shankar wrote in a statement accompanying the announcement. "To me, this animated project represents another step in the evolution of mending the torched bridge between the games industry and Hollywood. I look forward to revealing to everybody what winning a chicken dinner looks like."

Lone Echo 2, which was initially announced back in 2018 for a release the following year, picks up after the events of the first game, catapulting protagonists Captain Olivia Rhodes and player-controlled android Echo One (nicknamed "Jack") 400 years into the future, where an abandoned space station holds the key to returning home.
Once again, Ready at Dawn has crafted a moody sci-fi adventure built around zero-gravity traversal and puzzling, with the developer promising "sharp visuals", "complex challenges", and "startling discoveries" as its "emotional" far-future story unfolds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 14's producer and director Naoki Yoshida has addressed the recent server congestion issues blighting the long-running MMO following a "staggering and unexpected" increase in the game's popularity.
"Final Fantasy 14 is currently experiencing a dramatic increase in its player base," Yoshida explained in a post to the game's website. "Recently, we have experienced record user numbers in all regions, with a vast amount of new players beginning their adventures." Indeed, the game successfully smashed its record for concurrent players on Steam earlier this month, reaching 47,542 concurrent players versus the previous record of 41,200 set in June 2019.
Although undoubtedly a boon for the potential longevity of the now-decade-old MMO, this "extreme influx" of new players, as Yoshida puts it, has placed a strain on Final Fantasy 14's servers, with congestion issues causing lengthy queue times and preventing players from creating new characters.

FIFA 22 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC (yes, PC gets the last-gen version) will be the most-played version of the game, given the enormous install base of the last-gen consoles versus the supply-constrained and newer current-gen.
So, it's worth running through what those who intend to play FIFA 22 on last-gen will get that's new in terms of gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever felt like Fallout 4 could stand to be a little more, well, Blair Witch? If you fancy stumbling around in the dark while being chased by unseen forces, this might be the mod for you. 
The Wilderness is a chunky Fallout 4 PC mod by El Ha that offers a worldspace "at least as big" as Nuka World, with a bunch of abandoned buildings and a spooky main quest. It's a map that often feels deliberately barren, with the player encouraged to traverse vast distances in search of shelter and supplies. Thanks to the gloomy atmosphere created through a combination of bad weather and a synth-heavy soundtrack, it's easy to get jumpy - and you'll probably find yourself getting creeped out by the landscape as much as the actual jumpscares. Any good horror is about tension, after all. 
On installing the mod, players are presented with a fast travel option north of Sanctuary called "The Wilderness". Travelling there (and walking forwards a little bit) will transport you to The Wilderness itself, a vast wasteland that feels a lot more abandoned than anything in the Commonwealth. You can explore the area in your own time if you fancy, but to start the main quest, you'll need to rummage around in the skeleton near the start area. This will give you your first map and a rather ominous quest message about avoiding "whatever is following you".

The introduction of helicopters was by far the most requested feature with over 1500 votes. We have yet to see any more details about it, but I can't imagine it will be too long before Asobo gives us a glimpse. 
Other requested features include support for multiple screens, DirectX 12 support, replay functionality, and a myriad of other features. The top bugs include incorrect weather and wind readings, game crashes, low-resolution textures and performance issues on some PCs.

Nexus Mods yesterday published a blog post detailing upcoming changes to its billing system. While Nexus Mods is usable for free, premium membership has been an option on the platform since 2007, providing perks such as ad-free browsing and uncapped mod download speeds. The current membership options are split into 1-month, 6-month, 12-month and lifetime plans, but that's set to change on 3rd August. 
"Since we first started offering Premium Membership, our billing system... has been handled by our Invision Board forums software and PayPal," Nexus Mods explained. "To be frank, it's old, archaic, held together by duct tape and glue and was never really intended to be used by a site as big as ours. It's so delicate, we have not been able to update our Premium Membership pricing since 2013 because doing so breaks many different elements of the billing and Premium membership system which we have no control over as the code is not ours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has unveiled its previously teased "new Tom Clancy game", revealing it to be XDefiant, a 6v6 free-to-play first-person shooter that, just as leaks suggested, mashes up factions from Ghost Recon, The Division, and Splinter Cell.
In its announcement video, Ubisoft calls XDefiant a "high-octane" arena shooter - playable solo or with friends - that features an "irreverent and rebellious" take on the normally serious Clancy vibe, alongside "realistic gunplay" and personalised classes in the form of factions. 
Each faction is said to offer its own "gameplay and team dynamics", as well as unique passive traits, ultras, and abilities that will "change the moment-to-moment gameplay". Players will be able to mix and match any faction, load out, and weapon - Ubisoft promises an "arsenal of authentic weapons and attachments" - and these can all be switched at will during a respawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised, EA has shared "a little something" related to its its highly anticipated Skate revival after announcing there'd be no news on the latest instalment of its long-dormant skateboarding series during this Thursday's EA Play Live. Skate fans probably shouldn't get too excited though; beyond confirmation that the game is still in the works, there's little to see here.
Announced last June, EA's Skate revival - the fourth game in the series and the first instalment since 2010's Skate 3 - is being worked on by recently formed studio Full Circle, which counts original Skate creators Deran Chung and Cuz Parry among its number.
Given that Full Circle only formally came into existence at the start of this year, work on the new Skate game is unsurprisingly still in its early stages, and Chung said as much in EA's new teaser video. "The truth is it's still early," he explained. "We're still working on it".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn has released a new Stories from the Outlands video, and this one is all about new character Seer: a cursed legend with microdrones and a very cool hat. 
Metamorphosis tells the story of Seer's childhood, explaining that "a bad omen cast a shadow" over his birth, and that his glance "can turn a mountain to dust, a king to a beggar and an ocean to a desert". It's a stunning video, and if you're wondering why the art style looks familiar, that's because the trailer was made in collaboration with animator Robert Valley, who's known for series Love, Death and Robots.    
The Apex Legends website gives a little more detail on the upcoming season, Emergence, and some further snippets of info about Seer. Apparently Seer wields microdrones and has an "artist's eye", which allows him to "spot opportunities that other Legends might miss, and seize them in the most beautiful way he can". A new LMG called the Rampage is also being introduced next season, and it apparently has a "surprising" amount of firepower. The new season will also introduce that much-anticipated Ranked mode for Arenas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go pulled off its big annual Go Fest event at the weekend with enjoyable gameplay and some excellent storytelling flourishes. In-game and in the real world, developer Niantic dropped an array of teases for the game's future, and seemed to nimbly avoid the technical snafus seen in the past when millions of people have logged on to play simultaneously.
Go Fest 2021 was ostensibly about Meloetta, the Mythical Pokémon said to inspire music. The event's first day was spent putting together a band of Pokémon creatures via a Choose Your Own Adventure-style experience which summoned Meloetta to catch at the end.
Day two of the event, on Sunday, was supposedly just about raiding - though Niantic had some other surprises in store. As the first day wrapped up at 6pm local time, a new Mythical creature suddenly appeared on Pokémon Go's loading screen. Then, from 2am, the game's skybox suddenly changed to a galactic background, dotted by mysterious animated portals.

New World is the imminent MMO from Amazon that's based around an Age of Discovery kind of idea. You set sail for a magical island with a powerful magical secret, and try to make a home there. Its key features are territory ownership and housing, and player versus player warfare, in addition to a large fantastical world to battle with and explore.
Verfaillie was referring to the paid quality of life and experience boosters players found evidence of during New World's concluded alpha test. These suggested you might be able to pay for things like rested experience, which can help you level up faster, as well as fast travel.

As explained in a tweet from the official Skate account, new studio Full Circle was only formed back in January, and as such the team is not quite ready to show the game. "It's still early and we are committed to doing this thing right which means it's gonna take some time," the statement said.  
It's not all doom and gloom, however: the statement said the team is "stoked to share a little something with you all tomorrow", so it seems we'll be getting some form of Skate news this week after all. Perhaps we'll finally get a name, or even a teeny tiny teaser.

Bloomberg, which led reporting earlier this year on the upcoming Switch remodel, reported last week that the OLED model was being priced higher to give Nintendo a better profit margin compared to the original Switch. Without naming Bloomberg, Nintendo issued a rare tweet to state "the claim is incorrect".
Nintendo went on to clarify that, beyond Switch OLED, it had "no plans for launching any other model at this time", pouring cold water on the suggestion a further new model might be in the works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GTA developer Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, is issuing takedown notices for GTA map mods.
"Just to make sure as many people here know as possible, Take-Two have been going heavy with the DMCAs this week, first starting with GTAV map mods like GTA3 Portland, Vice City Overhaul, etc," writes Ash_735 on the official GTA Forums (thanks, PC Gamer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator will reportedly take up almost 100GB on Xbox consoles.
The news came via Twitter user Idle Sloth, who showed that if you select "Manage with Game Pass" on the the game's Xbox Store page, it'll give you the full install size: 97.2GB.
As our pals at Pure Xbox report, that's just the standard edition, too, so depending upon what flavour current-gen Xbox you're running - the X or S - and what edition you'd like to play, it may take up even more than that.

The part-business, part-memoir book - called Disrupting the Game: From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo - also shares business and "leadership lessons" from the executive, including "how to create vibrant and believable visions for your team and company [and] how to maintain relentless curiosity and know when to ask questions to shatter the status quo".
"Although he's best known as Nintendo's iconic President of the Americas-immortalised for opening Nintendo's 2004 E3 presentation with, 'My name is Reggie, I'm about kicking ass, I'm about taking names, and we're about making games'-Reggie Fils-Aimé's story is the ultimate gameplan for anyone looking to beat the odds and achieve success," the book's Amazon blurb says (thanks, VGC).

Inspired by characters from God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Shadow of the Colossus, and Bloodborne, the outfits had originally only been available for a limited time over the Christmas holidays. Now, however, they can be unlocked by completing any Legends Story or Survival mission with each class.
That's not all, though. The team also took the time to share some stats about the Ghost of Tsushima, including the revelation that since it launched a year ago, collectively there have been 679.2 million standoffs, 333.1 million duels, 68.5 Haikus written, and together we've taken 61 million in-game photos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some more speedrunning to watch following this year's Summer Games Done Quick? There's plenty more where that came from, as all-women speedrunning event Flame Fatales is taking place next month. 
The online event is taking place between 15th-21st August, and will be broadcast on the Games Done Quick Twitch channel. There's a real variety of games listed in the lineup, with everything from Warframe to a 15-card run of Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories. There are speedrunning favourites like Celeste and Super Metroid, along with some stranger entries like Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue. Oh, and I'm also glad to see there's also a Fire Emblem: Three Houses run in there. 
The event is being held in support of Malala Fund - a non-profit organisation founded by Malala and Ziauddin Yousafzai in 2013, which works to "champion every girl's right to 12 years of free, safe, quality education". Flame Fatales raised $80k (£63.8k) for Malala Fund last year, and since 2010, Games Done Quick events have raised over $34m (£24.6m) for charity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a year of research, Pokémon Go fans have uncovered a hidden mechanic involved in catching creatures from raid battles.
The research, published today by fan resource The Silph Road, appears to show a secret modifier that boosts the likelihood of catching a raid boss over the course of an encounter.
Simply put, the longer it takes you to catch a boss, the more likely it becomes that your next Premier Ball throw will actually do so. Or, as The Silph Road reports: "You are more likely to catch the raid boss on the 10th throw of the encounter than on your first."

The developer plans to update the High Alert perk to let players hear Dead Silent footsteps. Currently, all High Alert does is make your vision pulse whenever enemies outside of your view see you. By then, of course, it's often too late.
This change to High Alert is important for anyone who plays Warzone - a game in which your ability to hear your enemy coming can make the difference between winning and losing a gunfight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Summer Games Done Quick is all wrapped up, but if you're looking for another exciting speedrun to watch, this world record-breaking blindfolded Super Mario Bros. run seems like a good place to start. 
Speedrunner Crescendo posted a video of the world record run last night, with the timer showing that he managed to beat the game in 11 minutes and 55 seconds. It appears the previous record was held by speedrunner dodai, who achieved a time of 14 minutes and 46 seconds back in 2016. 
This all sounds impressive on paper, but the run itself makes for remarkable viewing: at one point Crescendo has to accurately count down the seconds needed to run a sufficient distance before making a series of perfect jumps. He uses fireballs as an echolocation device, and is able to figure out his surroundings from the noise they make when hitting a wall. He also seems to break bricks to figure out his position.

Raven has talked about making it so it takes longer to kill an enemy in Warzone for some time now.
This morning, a sweeping weapon balance pass, which Raven called "the biggest balance update in the history of Warzone", has seen some weapons heavily nerfed. Guns such as the SCAR, Oden, both AK-47s and the FAL all took a hit, with a particular focus on reducing torso multipliers.

This latest setback, of at least six months, is the most major yet - though it doesn't come as too much of a surprise. Fan response to Re:Verse's beta was mixed to say the least, and Capcom said today it needed more time "to deliver a smooth gameplay experience".

Don't expect any differences, outside of the box and cartridge. Nintendo has also yet to set a price, though in the US the digital and physical versions are sold for the same amount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft maker Mojang has released a new Caves and Cliffs test live for PC, and fans are seriously impressed by the changes it makes.
The 1.18 experimental snapshot allows for some truly spectacular world generation, including realistic-looking mountain peaks and Mines of Moria-like cave structures. 
The only thing which disappointed me was these "cheese", "spaghetti" and "noodle" caves were not actually places you could mine out Italian foodstuffs. (Those names simply reflect the holey or elongated shapes created by the snapshot's cave generation algorithm.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTube is getting several new live-streaming features today, and they may seem rather familiar, as all three of them have been popular features on Twitch for some time. 
As spotted by The Verge, YouTube streamers will now be able to create polls inside their chats, and limit the chats to subscribers-only. Viewers will now also be able to create clips of streams. 
Although the features are hardly the most original, they should give YouTube streamers a little more control over their communities. The subscribers-only chat option is a useful way to moderate discussion and discourage any unwelcome drive-by comments from new viewers. Polls provide another way for viewers to stay engaged with the action - and are a handy tool for streamers looking to find out what their community wants to watch next.

The streaming giant has now hired former EA, Oculus and Zynga exec Mike Verdu as vice president of game development, Bloomberg has reported, and is set to add its first games to its subscription offering within the year.
There's no detail yet on what the mix of games will look like, to what extent Netflix will make its own original games, or whether any big franchises you've already heard of will be part of the plans.

Introduction
Are you interested in learning about what SIG Usability does and how you can get involved? Well, you're at the right place. SIG Usability is all about making Kubernetes more accessible to new folks, and its main activity is conducting user research for the community.

PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners will all be able to play together, with the option to opt-out of mixing PC and console groups if you so choose.
Separately, PS4 and Xbox One console players can also play together, but separate from other platforms. This makes sense, considering last-gen platforms feature 64 instead of 128-player matches.

I can accept that anti-piracy measures are a necessity, and I can equally accept that their sophistication these days may have a certain level of CPU overhead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several of these plans, such as a share of revenue from Stadia's Pro subscription service and payouts for converting Stadia customers to Pro subscribers, seem directly aimed at boosting its paid membership offering.
For individual games, there's a new 85 percent revenue split for titles sold after 1st October up until the end of 2023, and up until the first $3m earned. This is similar to both Google and Apple's app store policies, which also take just 15 percent of the revenue cut compared to the industry standard 30 percent, up to a certain threshold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember that Bloodborne PSone demake project that imagined what the game would look like if it had been transported back through the console generations? Well, the team has provided us with another update video to show their progress, and they've now managed to recreate an entire PSone-style boss fight in Unreal Engine 4. 
Developer Lilith Walther, who's an Unreal Engine 4 tech artist and also lead programmer on indie JRPG Witch, shared a video of the boss fight on Twitter. It shows the player taking on Father Gascoigne, and features cutscenes, destructible gravestones and music produced on a Roland SC-88 for "maximum authenticity". You can take a look at the full video below:  
It's seriously impressive work, and personally I think the atmosphere in the "PSone" version feels even spookier than in the original game. The comparison video showing the same cutscene in Bloodborne and the demake is also well worth a watch:

The Titanic Mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven aims to do exactly what it says on the tin, which is to put the RMS Titanic in Mafia. This isn't just any old 3D model seen from a distance, however - the mod team is trying to make "one of the most detailed and accurate free 3D recreations of the Titanic ever made". Players will be able to explore the ship in freeroam mode, and the work done so far really does look stunning:
On top of all that, the mod even comes with its own storyline. It promises fully voice-acted missions, complete with cutscenes and a new soundtrack.

The creator of the cheat, who goes by the name "USER101", has slapped a statement on the website for User Vision Pro, which Activision took steps to scrub from the internet after console competitive multiplayer fans expressed concern about its potential to ruin games.
A new version of existing cheat User Vision Pro was set to use machine learning to analyse gameplay footage in real-time before sending inputs to a controller.

As the Kubernetes API evolves, APIs are periodically reorganized or upgraded.
When APIs evolve, the old APIs they replace are deprecated, and eventually removed.
See Kubernetes API removals to read more about Kubernetes'
policy on removing APIs.
We want to make sure you're aware of some upcoming removals. These are
beta APIs that you can use in current, supported Kubernetes versions,
and they are already deprecated. The reason for all of these removals
is that they have been superseded by a newer, stable (“GA”) API.
Kubernetes 1.22, due for release in August 2021, will remove a number of deprecated
APIs.

A raft of popular Warzone streamers were shocked to see their accounts hit the maximum level 1000 while playing last night, and all Black Ops Cold War weapons in the game hit maximum level, complete with all camos unlocked.
Yes, even the incredibly difficult to obtain Dark Matter camos for these weapons were unlocked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG Mobile really has been through the wringer in India: its popularity in the country led to concerns that children were spending too long playing the game, and several Indian cities placed bans on the game in 2019 after blaming it for promoting violent behaviour. Then, in 2020, PUBG Mobile was banned across the entire country following increased tensions between China and India. As the game was published by Chinese company Tencent, PUBG Mobile was included in the list of 118 apps banned in India over security concerns. 
But it seems PUBG Corp wasn't quite ready to give up, and a new version of the game is already seeing massive success. 
Battlegrounds Mobile India is the new (but still not particularly catchy) name of PUBG Mobile in India, and it's off to a roaring start. The game launched on 2nd July, and now has 34 million registered players, 16m daily active users, and a peak concurrent player count of 2.4 million. And apparently it's not even on the Apple App Store yet (via Times of India).

In a post on the Frontier forum, chief David Braben said the studio accepts the "frustration" players have had with the Odyssey expansion since it came out in May.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched, quickly accruing a 'Mostly Negative' rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.

Square Enix's role-playing adventure, which launched on PC in December 2015, received an update to fix an issue with Lightning's voice not being played in some scenes, according to a note on Steam.
How random! Or is it? As many fans have already speculated, this update may be more about tidying up the game ahead of a launch into Xbox Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn has been battling hackers in its online games for some time, but the situation escalated recently when hackers blocked players from accessing Apex Legends in order to complain about hacking in Titanfall. And unfortunately it seems the saga is having an impact on Respawn's development plans, with work on at least one highly-anticipated feature for Apex Legends, cross-progression, slowed by the recent spate of attacks.  
Earlier this week Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier responded to a question about cross-progression on Twitter, explaining that "recent hacks on Apex and TF have slowed down the progress of it". He added that the studio needed to "context switch to solving live game issues". 
Although cross-platform play was implemented in Apex Legends last year, players have so far been unable to transfer progress between accounts on different platforms (aside from moving between Steam and Origin). It's a feature the team seems eager to introduce, with Grenier explaining via Reddit that implementing it will be "much harder post-launch since users may have multiple accounts to merge or use". Given the ongoing problems with hacking in Apex Legends and the Titanfall games, it sounds like it could be a little while longer before we see this feature implemented.

In a series of tweets this morning, Kojima compared the typical use of the term Director's Cut in the movie business, and what had happened here. 
Kojima's reasoning is the PlayStation 5 version's new features were all developed after the original Death Stranding released, rather than it being a new version of the game assembled from cut content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a week of weird and wonderful speedruns, this year's Summer Games Done Quick event came to an end on Sunday - with a total of $2.8m (£2m) raised for charity. 
This year the online speedrunning event was raising money for Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières), a charity that provides medical assistance to those affected by conflict, disasters, epidemics or exclusion from healthcare. The donations from the latest event mean that Games Done Quick has now raised over $34m (£24.5m) for charity in total. 
As you may have noticed from Twitter, one of the highlights of this year's Summer Games Done Quick was a GeoGuessr speedrun, in which player Havrd managed to figure out his locations with remarkable accuracy. The Pokémon Black and White any percentage race between PulseEffects and Swiftalu, meanwhile, came down to the last five seconds. You can check out both of these highly entertaining speed runs below - or check out the full catalogue of runs on GDQ's YouTube channel.
