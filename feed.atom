        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Epic Games Store has booted Fallout: New Vegas up the bum and off its freebie list, making room for another free weekly title - which this time looks an awful lot like Midnight Ghost Hunt.


Midnight Ghost Hunt, from developer 
Vaulted Sky Games, is described as a "chaotic multiplayer hide-and-seek game" that casts one team of four as fearless Ghost Hunters and the other as naughty spirits intent on causing the former harm.


Ghost Hunters get the cool gadgets, as you might imagine, including a Spectrophone, Radar and Pathfinder for the spook detection bit, plus traps and vacuums to capture them, and a heap of more direct spectre-slaying tools, including sledgehammers, harpoons, and a cannon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 is off to a roaring start on Steam, having more than doubled the all-time record for concurrent players set by its nearest fighting game rival in less that 24 hours of release.


As flagged by Steam analyst Benji-Sales on Twitter, Street Fighter 6 has already secured a significant all-time concurrent peak on Valve's storefront, recorded at 66,317 players by SteamCharts at the time of writing. The figure is more than twice that of its nearest fighting competitor, Mortal Kombat 11, which currently enjoys an all-time peak of 27,301 players.


Street Fighter 6's concurrent peak is also leagues ahead of its direct predecessor, Street Fighter 5, which reached an all-time high of 13,807 players on Steam, and it's also managed to outshine the likes of Tekken 7, whose all-time peak sits at 18,766 players

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its Pride Month festivities, Microsoft has made developer Don't Nod's well-received queer mystery adventure Tell Me Why free to download and keep in its entirety on Xbox and PC, in what's becoming a bit of a Pride tradition.


Tell Me Why, if you're unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the Alaskan town of Delos Crossing.


Their troubled past begins to resurface, though, and the slick mystery thriller gains a distinctly supernatural tinge (this is very definitely a spiritual sibling to Don't Nod's Life is Strange 1 & 2), but Tell Me Why never loses sight of the beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists, even if it doesn't quite reach the memorable highs of its forebears.

Researchers and programmers immediately started modifying it, improving it, and getting it to do things no one else anticipated. And their results have been immediate, innovative, and an indication of how the future of this technology is going to play out. Training speeds have hugely increased, and the size of the models themselves has shrunk to the point that you can create and run them on a laptop.

In a statement issued via Twitter today, Rebirth producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed development is progressing smoothly and a firm release date is now being considered. So that's nice.


Square Enix has Rebirth listed for a "winter 2023" release. Up next from the publisher is the all-new Final Fantasy 16, which is released later this month.

Blizzard scribe Eric Covington says he wrote jokes "lampooning generic corporate gree" for the game's Loot Specialist loot goblin, a character working for the in-game Venture Company.

The listing, shared on reddit, suggests the demo is on the PSN and ready to go, but has only been seen by those who have pre-ordered the game in advance and when browsing on mobile. I've seen no mention of a demo on the console PSN myself.


Square Enix stated a demo was on the way, but no release date was given. So when might it arrive?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've squeezed every last drop of spade-based fun from developer Vine and Yacht Club Games' Shovel Knight spin-off Pocket Dungeon, help is at hand! The extremely enjoyable adventure is poised to receive its "gigantic" free Puzzler's Pack DLC next Tuesday, 6th June.


Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon, if you're unfamiliar, sees the titular spade-wielding hero try his hand at block-falling puzzle-action. Across a procession of single-screen dungeons, players must dodge perpetually tumbling enemies and obstacles then smack chains of them into oblivion, keeping things clear long enough to eventually escape. It's a lot more nuanced than that, though, and clever enough that Eurogamer's Christian Donlan slapped its "lovely balance of precision and chaos" with a Recommended badge in 2022.

Anyway, the already surprisingly ample package is set to expand again on Tuesday, when Pocket Dungeon's Puzzler's Pack DLC arrives on PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile via Netflix. It adds Puzzle Knight and Mona as playable chracters - the first able to rotate surrounding foes clockwise to create new combos, the latter armed with alchemist abilities that can explode nearby potions - plus new battles, boons, bosses, feats, and a "ton" of relics.

GSC Game World - which relocated from Kyiv to Prague last year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine - first confirmed it was the target of Russian hackers back in March, when it revealed an employee's accounts was hacked and that the studio had been threatened with blackmail.


"We are a Ukrainian company," it wrote at the time, "and like most Ukrainians, we have experienced many things that are much more terrifying: destroyed houses, ruined lives, and the deaths of our loved ones. Attempts to blackmail or intimidate us are completely futile".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we teeter on the edge of Summer Game Fest and the Season of Big Announcements, Ubisoft is revving up for June's Ubisoft Forward showcase with a new trailer highlighting at least some of the games that'll feature - and one vague tease that may or may not be Star Wars.


Ubisoft Forward, which is being broadcast live from Los Angeles - as good an excuse as any to resurrect that old Just Dance dance number, if you ask me - takes place on Monday, 12th June, at 6pm BST/10am PDT. A pre-show of undisclosed content will begin a quarter of an hour earlier.


The main event will feature a closer look at the publisher's upcoming slate of releases, with Assassin's Creed Mirage, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and The Crew Motorfest all now confirmed for a showing. We'll probably also get at least some updates on Ubisoft's raft of other lingering titles, including its free-to-play games and the perpetually delayed Skull and Bones - but not, as we recently heard, the now-rebooted Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.

Meta describes the Meta Quest 3 - which will be fully compatible with the existing Meta Quest 2 library - as the "first mainstream headset with high-res colour mixed reality", and promises "better displays and resolution", greater comfort, a 40 percent slimmer optic profile, and twice the graphics performance using "next-gen Qualcomm chipset".


Its mixed reality feature set includes "dual 4MP RGB colour cameras, a depth sensor for a more accurate representation of your play space, and 10x more pixels in Passthrough compared to Quest 2". Additionally, Meta has "completely redesigned" Quest 3's Touch Plus controllers, dropping the outer tracking rings and adding "TruTouch haptics".

Kojima's comments come from a recently-translated interview with magazine Weekly Toyo Keizai (thanks Games Radar), in which he states the game required 300 revisions following 9/11, leaving his team in "crisis mode".



The end of the game has Arsenal Gear (a giant military fortress) crashing into Manhattan, but the final release shows only the before and after, with the rest left to the player's imagination.

These moments in the sequel's gameplay reveal were impressive, invoking memories of similar fluidity from Insomniac's fellow PS5 exclusive Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. But I still had questions. Can we only switch characters at certain story points or will we be able to switch between them freely?

No Man's Sky for Mac machines was announced just under a year ago during Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote, where it took centrestage as a bit of a poster child for the tech giant's new Metal 3 API. At the time, it was expected to release before the end of the year (as was a version for iPad) but that ultimately slipped into 2023.


And now, a year and one ambitious Switch release later, Hello Games has confirmed No Man's Sky arrives for Mac computers today, "built from the ground up with a new rendering pipeline to take full advantage of Metal and Apple silicon".

ZA/UM boss Ilmar Kompus made the statement in an interview with People Make Games, in which he was questioned on his buyout of shares in the company and whether or not Kompus illegally used company money to do so. The interview forms part of a longer documentary on the recent events surrounding Disco Elysium.


"The status of this sequel is something that has been jeopardised by this PR campaign as such, and the conflict as such," Kompus said, referring to the publicity ZA/UM has faced from former employees in the past couple of years. Although the lawsuit filed by former executive producer Kaur Kender was dropped, the company is still in the midst of another legal battle against writer Robert Kurvitz, who claims he was, along with Aleksander Rostov and Helen Hindpere, fired "under false premises".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firaxis Games - the developer behind the likes of XCOM, Civilization 6, and last year's Marvel's Midnight Suns - has laid off around 30 developers.


The layoffs occurred yesterday according to a report by Axios, with a representative for Firaxis publisher 2K Games telling the website the cuts were made due to a "sharpening of focus, enhancements of efficiencies, and an alignment of our talent against our highest priorities".


These latest job cuts mark the second round of layoffs at the publisher this year. Back in March, Take-Two confirmed it was cutting jobs at Private Division - the publishing label behind OlliOlli World and Kerbal Space Program - alongside other unspecified parts of the company.

Grassetti joined Santa Monica Studio in 2013, following stints at BioWare as a character artist and at PlayStation as an art supervisor on a number of first-party games, eventually moving to a principal artist role on 2018's God of War and, later, art director on its acclaimed sequel.


Grassetti confirmed his departure from Santa Monica Studio earlier this month, promising to reveal his next role soon. That day has now arrived, with Grassetti announcing he's joined Netflix Games to work on a new AAA title alongside Staten (who left Microsoft in April), former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny, and ex-Coalition technical director Jerry Edsall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed June's line-up of PlayStation Plus Essential titles, which this time around look an awful lot like Jurassic World Evolution 2, Trek to Yomi, and NBA 2K23.


Starting with Jurassic World Evolution 2 (PS4, PS5), it's the sequel to Frontier Development's decent if unremarkable 2018 theme park management sim, in which the genre's usual selection of rides and amusements are switched out in favour of rather more deadly attractions. It's a bit of an underwhelming follow-up, but it does offer a couple of improvements, including larger maps, more diverse biomes, and a new Chaos Theory mode revisiting key movie moments.


Trek to Yomi (PS4, PS5), meanwhile, comes from Shadow Warrior studio Flying Wild Hog, and takes players on an striking black-and-white adventure inspired by cinema's classic samurai tales. In more practical terms, it blends side-scrolling platforming with sword combat - a mixture that didn't quite grab Eurogamer's Robert Purchese when he took a look last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has stated the company has never had a "systemic issue with harassment" in a new interview with Variety.


His comments are in response to a lawsuit against the company by the State of California in 2021, claiming it had a "frat boy" culture. In the years since, a number of sexual harassment lawsuits have been filed and Kotick himself has been accused of turning a blind eye.


"We've had every possible form of investigation done. And we did not have a systemic issue with harassment - ever. We didn't have any of what were mischaracterisations reported in the media," Kotick told Variety. "But what we did have was a very aggressive labour movement working hard to try and destabilise the company."

The game was previously delayed in 2021 into 2022, but now will launch with four co-operative four-player missions specifically focusing on "the experiences of US Marine fireteams on the first day of the battle".



The game has been controversial since its first announcement due to its focus on realistically depicting the battle of Fallujah, one of the bloodiest battles in the US-led invasion of Iraq.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Microsoft and PlayGround Games are getting ready to give us a fresh glimpse at Fable.


A new post on the console's official Twitter account showed an Xbox controller covered in glitter. Curious. 


From the controller, a trail, still in glitter, leads along the floor, over the kitchen sink, up the stairs and across a desk all the way up to a monitor displaying the Xbox Games Showcase home screen.  While this is all going on, nostalgic music tinkers along in the background.

Kojima and Konami had a public fallout before the developer launched his own studio, Kojima Productions, so this news doesn't come as a huge surprise.


Speaking to IGN, a Konami spokesperson confirmed Kojima Productions is not involved, but the developer of the remake is Virtuos who worked on Dark Souls Remastered and Uncharted 4.

First up is Grunge Revival Kit, which, as its name suggests, whisks players back to the 90s, for a clothing-focused pack themed around "the unpolished, the imperfect, and the free-spirited".


EA is yet to detail the DLC's exact contents, but expect "worn textures, layered options, and bold accessories", ranging from old band tees and baggie hoodies to faded jeans.

Mortal Kombat 1 finally got its proper unveiling in May, with NetherRealm confirming it to be a reboot of sorts set in a "reborn" universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang.


The full game is scheduled to release on 19th September but, before then, NetherRealm and publisher Warner Bros. are giving players a couple of opportunities to put a limited build through its paces; those who pre-order Mortal Kombat 1 can participate in a beta test happening in August, and there's also a newly announced "online stress test" on the way.

The CMA made the shock decision to block Microsoft proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard in April, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk "stifling competition in this growing market".


And now, following the recent publication of Microsoft's summary of application to appeal the CMA's decision - in which it accused the UK regulator of making "fundamental errors in its assessment" - the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal has held a case management conference to iron out preliminary details of the hearing between Microsoft and the CMA.

Traversing the vast space of Hyrule (and the Depths) can be a bit of a slog on foot or horse, but one vehicle has easily solved this problem.

The airbike, as demonstrated by YouTuber Uncle Dane, only requires two fans and one steering stick, which can be easily gotten from Zonai Device Dispensers or found scattered about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog has shared an update on its long-in-the-works The Last of Us multiplayer title, saying it has "realised what is best for the game is to give it more time". It's also teased a new "brand-new single-player experience" currently in the works.


Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer project was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but the studio announced it was separating the two halves in 2019. Since then, updates on the multiplayer game have been sparse, with Naughty Dog popping up to confirm "we're working on it" in 2021 and then, last year, promising more would be revealed in 2023.


Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann reiterated the studio's intention to share more about the game "later this year" back in January, but a new statement from the developer suggests its plans for a more substantial reveal in 2023 may currently be on hold.

Roots of Pacha, which launched to an extremely positive reception back in April, was pulled from Valve's storefront by publisher Crytivo earlier this month - a move developer Soda Den claimed had occurred ""without [its] knowledge or consent".


"We worked hard to amicably resolve our issue with Crytivo internally," it said at the time. "Instead of working with us to address the issue, Crytivo went to Valve and authorised them to remove Roots of Pacha from Steam". Crytivo, meanwhile, claimed Soda Den had unexpectedly moved to "unilaterally rescind the contract we had worked under for three years".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as it said it would, Microsoft has appealed the CMA's decision to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and its summary of arguments is now available for scrutiny.


In April, after months of deliberation, the UK's Competition and Market Authority made the shock decision to block Microsoft proposed $69b acquisition of the Call of Duty maker, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk "stifling competition in this growing market".


It's a position that was welcomed by some and by rejected by others. The EU, which approved the deal in May after Microsoft agreed to concessions, has been critical of the CMA's stance, and a number of UK politicians, including chancellor Jeremy Hunt, have also raised concerns. Microsoft, of course, has also criticised the decision, confirming it would launch an appeal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment, the studio behind the recently released and critically lambasted The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, has reportedly received funding from the German government to develop a second Lord of the Rings title.


As spotted by German website Wirtschaft (thanks Gamesradar), Daedalic has been awarded a €2m grant - approximately £1.7m - by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs to work on what appears to be a second game in J. R. R. Tolkein's beloved fantasy universe.


The project, which is currently listed under the codename "It's magic" on the Ministry of Economic Affairs' website, is described (via Google Translate) as a game that will transport players to a "lush world full of mythical creatures and magic" and tell a "story from a character's perspective that has never been told before."

And in that spirit, developer Turn 10 has now revealed its latest Forza Motorsport game, bound for Xbox Series X/S and PC, will be getting two showings in June.


Forza Motorsport's first appearance will occur almost exactly a year after its official unveiling, during Microsoft's big Xbox Games Showcase for 2023, which kicks off on 11th June at 6pm BST. Here, Turn 10 will, as detailed on Twitter, be giving onlookers an "up-close look at the cars" they'll be a-whizzing in when launch day finally arrives.


Then, with that presumably comparatively swift segment out the way, Turn 10 will be going it alone with its own Forza Monthly showcase on 13th June. Here, it'll be serving up a "full walkthrough of [Forza Motorsports's] single-player career gameplay".

Lundgren, perhaps most famous for playing boxer Ivan Drago in Rocky 4, told Swedish publication Aftonbladet he's in South Africa shooting a spinoff series of The Witcher, which Collider speculates is the upcoming show about the Rats.


The Rats are a group of young Nilfgaardian thieves introduced in Andrzej Sapkowski's Time of Contempt
novel. The third season of The Witcher (the last starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia), adapts this book, and so the expectation is the Rats will be introduced to fans of the show before their spin-off hits the screen.

If you answered yes to that question, well I have some good news. The officially-licenced Mega Man slippers will be available this summer (23rd June, to be precise). 


Clothing and costume store Fun has unveiled this new pair of Mega Man slippers, which have been designed to resemble Mega Man's classic series look. They have a stitched Mega Man on the side, and red emblems on the sole. Surely, a much more comfortable option for lounging around the house in than Mega Man's own, robotic booties.

This collection will include the first three Metal Gear Solid games - Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (both HD Collection versions), and will launch in the autumn.


However, the Konami website for the collection includes a blank space with "stay tuned for more information", which the PlayStation Store has revealed will be Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The boss of the European Commission has explained in detail why her agency approved Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal - and why she thinks the UK was wrong to block it.


In a speech given yesterday, European Commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager laid out the regulator's own "call of duty" to only block buyouts when really necessary.


"Merger control is by nature a forward-looking exercise," Vestager said. "But that power comes with challenges... And to make things even more complicated, for global deals many authorities are predicting the future, at the same time. Of course we cooperate, but disagreements sometimes happen. No less recently than last week, we cleared the Microsoft/Activision deal, while the CMA decided to block it."

The patch notes themselves are minimal, stating some audio bug fixes, a fix to the quest 'Camera Work in the Depths', and "several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience".


It's this last point that presumably covers the duplication glitches that seem to have been removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've not heard much from THQ Nordic's Alone in the Dark reboot since its surprise unveiling last year, but now the promising project is back with a 25th October release date and - for the impatient among us - a playable prologue that's available now.


The original Alone in the Dark, for those too young to remember, released in 1992 and offered a genuinely groundbreaking journey into the unknown. It's widely considered to be the granddaddy of the survival horror genre, pioneering the fixed-camera spook-house formula that would go on to influence the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill.


THQ Nordic's reimagined version of Alone in the Dark - which is being handled by Swedish developer Pieces Interactive with Soma and Amnesia: The Dark Descent writer Mikael Hedberg at the helm - takes the basic premise of the 1992 original, in which private detective Edward Carnby helps Emily Hartwood investigate her uncle's suicide at the gloomy Derceto Mansion, and cranks up the Southern Gothic as it attempts to filter the originals' blend of exploration, combat, puzzles, and story through a more modern lens.

Homeworld 3 is being developed by Blackbird Interactive and marks the first new numbered game in the series since Relic Entertainment's Homeworld 2 in 2003. However, news of its progress has been erratic following its official unveiling by publisher Gearbox in August 2019.


After an extended silence, the tail-end of 2021 bought a Q4 2022 launch window, but that then slipped to the "first half of 2023" so Blackbird could deliver the game "at the highest quality". Now, however, with time to hit its most recent release target rapidly running out, Gearbox has announced another delay, this time shifting Homeworld 3's release into early next year.

The original Cat Quest released in 2017, sending players, in the role of a brave feline warrior, on a quest to save their kidnapped sister. It was a wonderfully refreshing thing, taking everything you'd expect from an action-RPG - real-time combat, dungeon crawling, and equipment progression - and turning it into a breezy, super-streamlined, pick-up-and-play package. It also had more cat puns than is probably legal.


A sequel arrived two years later, offering a slightly evolved take on the original's formula - most notably introducing dogs (and, yes, dog puns) - and now The Gentlebros is getting ready to do it all over again in Cat Quest: Pirates of the Purribean.

We got an extended look at Spider-Man 2, and announcements of the much-rumoured Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, Bungie's next game Marathon, Haven's first title Fairgame$, and something called Concord. Actual gameplay and firm release dates were thin on the ground, however. And many of the games shown during PlayStation's event will also be available on Xbox.  
Was this a good games event, even if it wasn't a great PlayStation one? How do we feel about Sony's game roadmap now? Joining me to discuss all of that and much more are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider this your last-minute reminder that the annual Summer Games Done Quick is back this weekend, bringing another seven days of charity speedrunning action.


Things kick of this Sunday, 28th May, at 5.30pm BST for a bit of pre-show pre-amble, with the main speedrunning event getting underway half an hour later, beginning with AlphaDolphin's Any% run of Sonic Frontiers. From there, things continue onward throughout the week until proceedings wind down at around 9.25am on Sunday, 4th June.


As ever, Summer Games Done Quick's full speedrunning schedule is an eclectic thing, covering retro classics, indie favourites, and triple-A blockbusters, with a few welcome oddities thrown in. This time around, expect to see the likes of Elden Ring and Hi-Fi Rush rubbing shoulders with Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue, Peggle Deluxe, Amnesia: Rebirth, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space Marine 2 has a new video that shows snippets of gameplay and offers a better look at the Tyranids.


Saber Interactive's hotly-anticipated (by me) sequel sees Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus stomp and shoot and generally smash to bits the xenos scum.


The video, below, shows more of this in action. I think it looks promising - you can see Saber's work on World War Z and its zombie swarm tech brought to bear here with the Tyranids.

Fallout: New Vegas is, of course, sensibly considered something of a classic, with Obsidian's open-world RPG refining and enriching the series' first trek into 3D - as seen in Bethesda Softworks' Fallout 3 - into an experience Eurogamer called "huge and sprawling, sometimes gaudy, even downright ugly at times – but always effortlessly, shamelessly entertaining".


"Obsidian has created a totally compelling world," contributor Dan Whitehead wrote in his 9/10 review back in 2010, "and its frustrations pale into insignificance compared to the immersive, obsessive experience on offer.

In China, chicken fans are getting something a bit funkier: Tetris. A chicken nugget shaped McDonald's toy which runs Tetris, to be precise.


The promotion was spotted by Retro Dodo, and McDonald's Chinese website has more details on where people can get one (and why Tetris).

Speaking to Eurogamer in a recent interview, associate game director Joe Piepiora outlined how story will work as part of Diablo 4's quarterly seasonal releases, which are separate from the planned release of traditional Diablo expansions.

Unlike Diablo 3, Diablo 4 seasons include self-contained storylines that expand the world of Sanctuary, rather than continue the main campaign. The continuation of the story is reserved for expansions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were plenty of announcements during Sony's Playstation Showcase last night, but the one that stood out most to me was Phantom Blade Zero. This quickfire action RPG looks brilliant and oh so slick. It blends Chinese martial arts and punk together, to create a new direction its developer has dubbed "Kungfupunk".


In Phantom Blade Zero, you take on the role of Soul. According to Soulframe Liang, founder of the game's developer S-Game, Soul is "an elite assassin serving an elusive but powerful organisation known simply as 'The Order'." Soul was framed for the murder of this organisation's patriarch, and was then wounded in the "manhunt that ensued". Thankfully, he was saved from death by a "mystic healer". 


This all sounds enticing enough already, in my opinion, but there is more. While Soul may have been saved by this healer, there is a catch - the cure only lasts for 66 days, and Soul needs to find out who framed him for killing The Order's patriarch before time runs out. Of course, this will not be an easy job, and Soul will have to fight against "powerful foes and inhuman monstrosities" on his journey. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.

That tweet - posted right after Sony's show finished - is clearly meant as a bit of fun. But it does also highlight just how much of tonight's PlayStation Showcase will be available elsewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has released a teaser trailer for Destiny 2: The Final Shape, the "final chapter of the Light & Darkness Saga".


It sees the surprise return of Cayde-6, one of Destiny's most popular characters. It's been four expansions since Destiny players waved farewell to Cayde, the wise-cracking Hunter originally played by Nathan Fillion who was shot dead by Uldren Sov. He even got a touching memorial players can visit in Destiny 2's Tower hub.


The CGI trailer begins with Warlock chief Ikora Rey staring into a campfire, talking to Cayde as if he's still alive. "You've missed so much," she says, sadly. "I wish you could have been there."

        <updated>2023-05-24T21:17:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well! Bungie has finally unveiled its next project, and it's quite a surprise, whisking the developer back to its 90s roots for a revival of its classic first-person shooter series Marathon, reimagined as a PvP shooter for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


The original Marathon released in 1994 and went on to spawn two sequels, at which point Microsoft swooped in to purchase Bungie and the Halo franchise was born. Since then, Bungie has been on a quite the journey, working its way through multiple Halo sequels and two Destiny games, the latter of which have kept the studio busy for over a decade. So it's kind of fascinating to see it cast its gaze backward for its first new project as a Sony-owned studio.


The new Marathon is described as a "sci-fi PvP extraction shooter" featuring "evolving, persistent zones" that, while not a direct sequel to the earlier games, is set in the same universe. "PvP" is the key here, too with Bungie confirming it won't have a single-player campaign. It will, however, support cross-play and cross-save between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

"There are many reasons for this," the developer explained. "For one, a large number of have shifted to digital only. You can buy a Sony PlayStation 5 without a disc drive and Microsoft's Xbox Series S is a digital only console. It is not uncommon to release modern games as digital-only." It also argued "not releasing a disc helps keep the price of the game at $59.99/€59.99 and the PC version at $49.99/€49.99", and insisted it "did not want to ship a disc product and have it require a download for the game".


Alan Wake 2 will be available in two versions at launch: a standard edition costing £39.99/€49.99/$49.99 USD on PC and £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 on consoles, plus a deluxe edition priced at £54.99/€69.99/$69.99 on PC and £64.99/€79.99/$79.99 on consoles.

Sword of the Sea is Giant Squid's third release - following on from 2016's deep sea adventure Abzû and 2020's The Pathless - and its announcement trailer, aired during Sony's latest PlayStation Showcase, focuses on a lone explorer, known as The Wraith, sand-surfing their way through a strikingly rendered desert, all undulanting sands and ancient temples, that suddenly gives way to roaring waves and flying marine life.


Giant Squid's creative director Matt Nava (who served as art director on Journey, in case you're wondering why the art style looks familiar) calls Sword of the Sea the studio's "most ambitious game to date" on the PlayStation Blog, noting its "Hoversword" traversal sytem - a mix of "snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one" - is core to the experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three and a half years after its announcement, numerous delays, and a new developer later, Ubisoft's beleaguered Price of Persia: Sands of Time remake is still in the "conception" phase.


Ubisoft's "fully-fledged" Sands of Time remake was officially revealed in September 2020, with an anticipated release date of January the following year. However, its troubled development saw the publisher twice delay its release, before finally shifting control of the project from Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.


Following that major upheaval in May 2022, Ubisoft would only say its Sands of Time remake would release "when it's ready". However, a new development update on the Ubisoft website now suggests that "ready" may still be some considerable way off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Netflix's live-action The Witcher adaptation prepares for its return on 29th June, showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich has shared a little more on Henry Cavill's decision to hang up his shoulder-length Geralt wig after season 3, admitting the team 'had the choice to end the show' after Cavill's departure, but felt there were "just too many stories left to tell".


Netflix revealed The Witcher's third season would be Cavill's last in October 2022, much to the disappointment of fans - Cavill has, afterall, been one of the few genuinely bright spots in a deeply uneven adaptation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the show's popularity, Netflix confirmed that instead of winding the series down it had instead recast the lead role, with Liam Hemsworth stepping into Geralt of Rivia's shoes for season 4 onward.


Now, however, in an interview with Total Film (thanks Games Radar), showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich has confirmed the team was given the option to wrap the series up with Cavill's departure, but instead opted to press on. "I mean, we had the choice to have Geralt exit and to end the show," Hissirch explained, "[but] that's not something that we were willing to do. There's just too many stories left to tell."

A series of Japanese stores now have Assassin's Creed Mirage available to pre-order, with a release date set for 12th October. Ubisoft is yet to officially name a date for the game, though this would line up with previous Assassin's Creed launches. 


Japanese gaming website Gematsu noted on Twitter this afternoon that retailers in the country do not typically list titles with placeholder dates. The same day being listed across various major retailer chains also points to the date being legitimate.

The show will be an hour long, apparently, and I'll be live reporting everything going on while chatting with you in the comments, because I have four hands.
So what can we expect? Well, Final Fantasy 16 will no doubt feature highly, what with it being a timed exclusive for PlaySation 5 and all, and with it being due next month. Will we get a demo date, perhaps? I'd also expect a solid look at Insomniac's new Spider-Man 2 game, due this autumn, which we still haven't seen a great deal of.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) makes managing seccomp, SELinux and
AppArmor profiles within Kubernetes easier than ever. It allows cluster
administrators to define the profiles in a predefined custom resource YAML,
which then gets distributed by the SPO into the whole cluster. Modification and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-rumoured Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is real and getting a multi-platform release on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC according to a new report by Windows Central.

Netflix has been threatening a crackdown on password sharing as a means of shoring up is stagnating subscriber numbers for some time now, and it began rolling out a related series of measures built around the notion of a designated "primary location" in February, albeit initially only in a limited number of countries.


Since then, Netflix's measures have continued to spread around the globe, and, as of today, are live in the UK. The streaming service says it has started emailing members that share their accounts with users outside their household, telling them they'll need to cough up an additional £4.99 a month if they want to continue doing so.

As far as the Destiny specific stuff goes, Season of the Deep (as today's update is known) is themed around Saturn's moon of Titan, where an uncharted ocean awaits. It introduces weekly Deep Dive missions, the Salvage seasonal activity, and fishing for Season Pass purchasers, while Lightfall + Annual Pass or Lightfall Dungeon Key owners gain access to a mysterious new dungeon - the first of two due this year - starting this Friday, 26th May.


As for Destiny 2's PlayStation collaboration, that's happening over on the premium store, where Bungie has shoved a bunch of cosmetics inspired by Sony's biggest games. With interest still high after its barnstorming TV adaptation, The Last of Us gets the most representation here, with a three-item Cordyceps Bundle featuring everyone's favourite fungi to be with. Specifically, there's the Clicker (Ghost), Blooming Terror (Ship), and Quarantine Runner (Sparrow).

The app recently introduced sweeping changes to its remote raiding feature, with players limited to using five remote raid passes a day, and each pass also now priced higher. Niantic said it had made these changes with the future of Pokémon Go in mind, and to ensure the game was still focused on its core pillars of exploration and social interaction.


But alongside criticism of Niantic's decision - which Steranka told Eurogamer last week in an interview that he had fully expected - the company's employees have also been targeted with personal abuse. Today, Steranka took to Twitter to highlight one such example.

It also adds in a range of new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress, so you will be quite literally kept on your toes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has released a new patch for fantasy adventure Forspoken, ahead of the release of its In Tanta We Trust DLC on Friday.


One feature is an adjustment to the frequency and "content" of the "banter" between Frey and Cuff during open world activities. The game already has an option to amend the amount of Cuff chatter, but as players criticised the game's dialogue, it seems Square Enix has continued to make tweaks.


Another interesting change is to the Tanta's Familiars: cat creatures Frey can find on her journey and who inhabit the game's rest spots. Now they will follow Frey around to collect mana and items - I'm picturing Frey accompanied by an army of cute cats, which sounds adorable.

An email seen by the New York Times  regarding 'Blizzard Diffusion' was sent to employees earlier this year. Blizzard Diffusion is the company's internal AI tool, which has allegedly been trained as an image generator on Blizzard's own titles (its name is a play on Stable Diffusion, another AI image generation platform). 


Reportedly, this tool was being used "to help generate concept art for game environments as well as characters and their outfits". Adham also made mention of possible tools for "autonomous, intelligent, in-game NPCs," "procedurally assisted level design" and AI-assisted "voice cloning," "game coding" and "anti-toxicity" in his email.

The class action suit was lodged this month by an unidentified minor - albeit via his legal guardian (thanks, Axios). The suit claims that Nintendo's gacha-style rewards system in Mario Kart Tour violated consumer protection and business profession laws.


Specifically, the boy is seeking compensation for Mario Kart Tour's Spotlight Pipes, which let you pay real-world money for in-game Ruby currency, and spend them on chances for randomised rewards.

Each game in the Final Fantasy series is individual - only a couple have had direct sequels - but Yoshida admitted this can be tough for marketing as some players approach the latest game wondering if the story continues from previous games.


"A lot of players are going to come in and they're going to look at it like a comic book where you have to read from the beginning to know what's going on now," Yoshida told GQ in an interview.

Located in Henderson, roughly 16 miles southeast of downtown Las Vegas, housing project Serenity Place includes street names inspired by Pokémon. This includes Charmander Lane, Charizard Lane, Jigglypuff Place, Snorlax Lane and Squirtle Lane. Yes, really.


Naming streets in the Vegas neighbourhood isn't an easy job, project construction manager Andrea Miller told local news station KLAS 8 News Now (via Polygon). However, Miller was inspired to use the above names as her sons are "obsessed" with Pokémon.

Summersett previously discussed the dynamic between Link and Zelda in an interview with The Gamer, in which she stated: "I know that they are in a relationship with each other, it's active, there's a lot of care and a lot of listening, and I just love that about it."


The quote was notable for going further than Nintendo itself has officially gone in defining the bond between The Legend of Zelda's two main characters, and while it was simply Summersett's own opinion, as voice actress for the series' namesake, it was pounced upon by fans.

With so little information currently out in the wild, many had assumed Massive's Star Wars project was still some considerable way off, but Kotaku is now reporting the title is, in fact, the mysterious "another large game" Ubisoft has previously confirmed to be launching during its 2023-24 fiscal year, with the publisher said to be targeting an "early 2024" launch.

Some publications began reporting potential co-op support in Spider-Man 2 earlier this week after fans unearthed comments made by Miles Morales voice actor Nadji Jeter last September. When asked if Spider-Man 2 would feature co-op during a SacAnime Summer 2022 Q&A, Jeter replied, "I don't know if it's been announced or not, but I think so."


Co-op speculation has followed Spider-Man 2 ever since Insomniac announced Peter Parker and Miles Morales would both play a prominent role in the sequel, but the studio has now shot down co-op chatter once and for all. After a fan tweeted to ask if co-op was on the cards, it replied wrote, "Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest is almost upon us, kicking off with a live showcase before splintering into a "season" of disparate publisher events in the absence of E3. But first that showcase, which is now confirmed to be two hours in length, and featuring at least a couple of "pretty big" things.


Summer Game Fest gets underway on 8th June, with a live show consisting of premieres, gameplay demos, and announcements. That's pretty much as far as details went in previous teases, but now, in an interview on the Epic Games Store, show host and producer Geoff Keighley has now shared a little more about what to expect from the format.


Alongside its now confirmed two-hour duration, Keighley suggests Summer Game Fest live will be a little more laidback compared to the bombastic Game Awards, offering a "chance to talk to the developers and showcase games and give a little bit more context around games". While the exact line-up still appears to be in flux, Keighley does say he expects the Summer Game Fest live show to feature three or four things that are "pretty big for this audience."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lars Gustavsson, former creative director on DICE's long-running Battlefield series, has unveiled his new studio TTK Games, which is currently developing an online shooter.


Gustavsson departed DICE last September after more than 20 years at the studio, having - as EA wrote in its announcement - "decided he is ready for a new adventure". Gustavsson offered no suggestion of what that new adventure might be at the time, but all has now been revealed.


Gustavsson's new studio, the Stockholm-based TTK Games, has been co-founded by four former members of DICE; Gustavsson will serve as CEO and creative director, while Daniel Berlin (previously lead world designer and design director on Battlefield) is senior design director. They're joined by chief technical officer and technical director Vidar Nygren (technical director on Battlefield), plus art director Peter Hoyles, who served as studio art director at DICE LA.

        <updated>2023-05-22T17:39:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yuke's, the renowned Japanese developer responsible for nearly two decades of popular WWE games, marks its return to the wrestling genre next month, when AEW: Fight Forever launches fo Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 29th June.


Yuke's has been associated wrestling ever since its inception in 1995, and the studio's long association with WWE began in 2000, with the launch of WWF SmackDown. It continued to work on the WWE licence until 2018's WWE 2K19, when publisher 2K decided to hand the reins exclusively to the US-based Visual Concepts, which had co-developed the series with Yuke's since 2013. Unfortunately, Visual Concepts' solo debut proved so disastrous 2K made the unprecedented move of skipping the long-running series' annual release for two years in a row, only bringing it back in 2022.


So with WWE 2K temporarily out of commision, wrestling fans were quite intrigued when, in 2020, it was announced Yuke's would be returning to the genre with a game for WWE rival AEW, under the watch of publisher THQ Nordic. And we'll finally get a chance to see what the developer's been up when AEW: Fight Forever launches this June.

Set to launch on 1st June for Lego VIP members, or 4th June for the rest of us, this new model will cost you a pretty penny. Its recommended retail price is £229.99, or $269.99 / €269.99 for those outside the UK. 


The set is a collaboration between Bandai Namco and the Lego Group, released to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of Pac-Man. It features the upper half of a Pac-Man cabinet. Along with the cabinet half itself, which is interactive, there are also Lego models of Pac-Man and two of its ghosts - Blinky and Clyde, to be precise.

Its style - instrumentation, arrangement - differs across the series, reflecting the world and characters of each game.


In Final Fantasy 16, the battle fanfare has (for the first time outside Final Fantasy 14) lyrics and is sung by a choir. Not only are those lyrics in Ancient Greek, they're a major plot spoiler for the game.

Matthew Porretta, who also plays Control's Dr. Casper Darling, appeared on YouTube podcast Monsters, Madness, and Magic over the weekend. There, he casually revealed Alan Wake 2 is "supposed to come out in October".


"I've been working on it," Porretta said, when the topic turned to Remedy's nightmarish 'my manuscript has come to life and everything is trying to kill me' thriller sequel. "That's supposed to come out in October. We're in the middle of working on it now."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation head Jim Ryan believes Sony's current strategy of releasing games on PC several years after their console launch is working well, and fans find the extra wait for a PC port "acceptable".


Chatting to Famitsu (via IGN), Ryan said Sony understood "the importance of PS5 exclusive titles" such as last year's God of War Ragnarök, and as such dismissed the idea of launching games on PC at the same time as their console counterparts. "PlayStation Studios' main responsibility is to make games for the latest PlayStation hardware that players will enjoy," Ryan explained. He went on to state the company is increasing its PS5 exclusives and "staggering the release of the PC versions". 


This comment from Ryan echoes those of PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, who previously stated that the company's first-party releases will likely take "at least a year" to launch on PC, with the possible exception of live-service games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's blockbuster fighting game franchise Super Smash Bros. isn't a good fit for online play, its creator Masahiro Sakurai has said. 


Speaking in his latest YouTube video on game development, Sakurai discussed the addition of online play to the series in Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii. In it, he lined out why he believed the series was better suited for local competition - for both philosophical and technical reasons.


Indeed, Sakurai addressed Nintendo's often shaky online servers, saying that "network lag tends to make the game a pretty choppy experience". Ultimately, though, it sounds like adding online play was something he had to do: "when it comes to technical issues, it doesn't really matter what I personally think," he said. "If my job is to do it, I'll do it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard is celebrating one whole year of Diablo Immortal with a Diablo 4-themed crossover.

The Merciless Monstrosity event will roll out next months, June 2023, and ushers in new quests, cosmetics, and a completely new zone and class, too.

"The creation of Sanctuary by Inarius and Lilith is a storied tale; its impact can still be felt today," Blizzard teases. "The Merciless Monstrosity event, Children of Lilith Battle Pass, and Hatred’s Heritage Phantom Market will be experienceable expressions of Sanctuary’s matriarch. Your opportunity to let sin flow freely will arrive in early June."

"As you know I'm usually a sceptic when others engage in hyperbole, [but] in the case of AI I'm pretty enthusiastic," Zelnick told investors (thanks, PC Gamer).

In a Twitter thread, indie team Rusty Lake detailed the trouble it has experienced securing its own username for its 240K+ member Discord community. 

Discord announced plans to change its usernames earlier this month. At present, usernames are case sensitive and have a four-digit identifier, called a discriminator, appended to create a unique username, but the new changes remove the need for the discriminator, meaning you don't have to remember the random number combination when trying to add friends.

The board game - which can be played solo or with up to four players - was first unveiled back in March, and has been backed by over 5500 people. 

"We can tell that the designers had played Dead Cells and that they weren't interested in simply doing a carbon copy," The Motion Twin team and Arthur Décamp, Dead Cells Game Director says of the project. "They had thought deeply about how to best adapt Dead Cells into board game format. The overarching principles of the game have been preserved (the energy, the visceral nature of combats, and the build options) without altering the experience expected for a modern board game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wonderful 101: Remastered's After School Hero DLC - which was promised as a Kickstarter stretch goal back in 2020 - has now arrived, and it's free to download on PlayStation and PC.


After School Hero was one of several stretch goals detailed when developer PlatinumGames opted to take a remastered version of Wii U cult classic The Wonderful 101 to Kickstarter back on 2020, and promised a side-scrolling adventure focused on a "young hero" named Luka.


The Wonderful 101: Remastered's other DLC stretch goal, a Time Attack mode, launched back in 2021, so it's been a bit of a wait for the DLC originally referred to as "Luka's First Mission".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 is finally official after several weeks of teases, but a few mysteries still remain. And it looks like Amazon might have inadvertently solved one of those ahead of schedule by leaking the characters included in the game's Kombat Pack DLC.


Mortal Kombat 1 - which, as rumoured, will be a reboot of sorts, taking place in a "reborn" universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang - is set to release on 19th September, and it'll be accompanied by a Kombat Pack providing early access to six additional playable characters and five assist characters known as Kameo Fighters.


At the time of Mortal Kombat 1's announcement, publisher Warner Bros. confirmed the Kombat Pack would be included in Mortal Kombat 1's Premium and Kollector's Editions, but neglected to tell prospective purchasers what additional characters they'd get in return for their money.

Described as an "immersive live experience that celebrates more than three decades of music from Sega's iconic mascot", Sonic Symphony promises a "musical tour" through the series' history. It'll feature "classic 8-bit and 16-bit tunes to rock and EDM songs", all played by a full symphony orchestra and rock band - and accompanied by on-screen Sonic footage for the benefit of those requiring eye stimulation along with the amusement to their ears.


Sega and show organiser MGP Live have announced two dates for the Sonic Symphony World Tour so far, beginning with a performance at London's Barbican Hall on 16th September this year. After that, it'll depart the UK and head over to the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, for a second show on 30th September.

Many publishers have adopted this $70 price point as standard, including the likes of Sony, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Earlier this week, Sega also suggested it could adopt a similar approach for its future releases, and stated it was "keeping an eye on market conditions".


As for those who have already increased prices to this higher point, Zelnick claimed he hasn't seen any real resistance from players so far.

Carmack announced he would attend BasedCon this week via Twitter, prompting displeasure from followers upset at the event's description as an alternative to the "publishing industry's hostility to authors who are critical of progressive dogma". 


The event's name stems from the internet slang "based", which BasedCon's own About page describes as "the opposite of social justice activism" and identified by "based beliefs" such as "discriminating against white people is racism", "men cannot give birth", and also "guns don't kill people, people kill people".

More interesting is that the game's item duplication glitches remain intact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer 2.21, which now owns the rights to Adeline Software's much-loved Little Big Adventure series, recently announced it was working on a ground-up "remaster" of both titles, and we've now been given a tiny glimpse of the Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up in action.


The original Little Big Adventure, if you're unfamiliar, released back in 1994 and delivered a memorable blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that followed young hero Twinsen as he attempted to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock. A sequel then followed three years later.


2.21 first discussed its plans to remaster Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 back in March, explaining it was taking on the projects while it continued discussions with publishers to make its previously announced Little Big Adventure reboot a reality.

When Sonic Prime was announced back in February 2021, Netflix described it as a 24-episode animated series that would send Sonic on a "journey of self-discovery and redemption" in which the "fate of a strange new multiverse" was in his hands.


Sonic Prime's initial batch of episodes saw Sonic traversing the Shatterverse - a collection of alternative dimensions formed after Dr. Eggman's Paradox Prism was destroyed in battle - in a quest to restore the universe, all with a little help from different versions of his familiar friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maquette, the striking "recursive" first-person puzzle adventure from developer Graceful Decay and publisher Annapurna Interactive, is making its way to Switch next week, on 25th May.


Originally released for PlayStation and PC back in 2021, Maquette builds an ingenious series of spatial challenges inspired by the small-scale sculptors' models that give the game its name.


Maquettes are sculptures crafted before embarking on a full-scale project, and in Graceful Decay's puzzler, that's reflected in environments that contain smaller versions of themselves. Crucially in Maquette, changes made to one environment affect the other - so if you were to, say, place a cube in a tiny courtyard in front of you, it would then materialise in the full-size courtyard you stand in, giving you a means to progress to the next area - and on it goes.

Although PowerWash Simulator has recieved a couple of free crossovers previously - whisking players to Tomb Raider's Croft Manor and Final Fantasy 7's Midgar - SpongeBob will be the first in a series of paid Special Pack DLC crossovers, which were announced as part of developer FuturLab's 2023 content roadmap back in April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon games for Nintendo Switch will finally connect to cloud service Pokémon Home following an update due next Wednesday, 24th May. 


Pokémon Scarlet and Violet first arrived in November last year, and until now have been unable to connect to Pokémon Home, the service which lets you transfer creatures to and from other Pokémon games. 


That all changes next week, when Scarlet and Violet will gain Home compatibility. This means being able to import any supported creature from any of the mainline games supported by Home at present, alongside the previous storage service Pokémon Bank, and also Pokémon Go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed puzzle game The Case of the Golden Idol is coming to Nintendo Switch. After a period of PC exclusivity, the murder mystery head scratcher will be making its console debut next Thursday 25th May. 


On its release, Switch players will be able to experience all of the game's redacted and perplexing scenarios in a whole new way, thanks to touchscreen controls. For those who don't want to get their screens all mucky, however, there is also a custom developed controller layout option for gathering up evidence. This Switch release also boasts an overhauled UI, for the "best user experience" when playing the game in either docked or handheld mode. 


As well as the base game, Switch owners will also have the opportunity to get their hands on Golden Idol's first expansion - The Spider of Lanka. This DLC kicks off a year before The Case of the Golden Idol's first scenario, and follows the story of Albert Cloudsley and Oberon Geller as they make their maiden voyage to the Kingdom of Lanka.

Mortal Kombat 1 has a brand new story featuring familiar characters, NetherRealm said. The debut trailer is below (be warned, things get very gory):

        <updated>2023-05-18T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia has officially unveiled its first mid-range Ada Lovelace graphics card, the RTX 4060 Ti, with both 8GB and 16GB variants at $399/£389 and $499 respectively. The 8GB card is the first to be released, with sales beginning on May 24th, while the 16GB variant debuts in July. The firm also detailed its mainstream RTX 4060 GPU, also coming in July, to debut at $299. 
All three models ought to offer a reasonable boost in performance over their predecessors, while also adding DLSS 3 frame generation - which is perhaps more impactful on mid-range hardware than it is on the likes of the RTX 4090 which is powerful enough without it. That should allow the 4060 family to be a reasonable choice for gaming at 1080p with maxed settings (including RT / DLSS), or at 1440p with some settings reductions. 
On average, Nvidia is claiming the 4060 Ti is 1.15x faster than the 3060 Ti and 1.6x faster than the 2060 Super (1.7x and 2.6x faster with DLSS 3). Similarly, the RTX 4060 is 1.2x faster than RTX 3060 and 1.6x faster than RTX 2060 (1.7x and 2.3x with DLSS 3).

Will the two struggle to co-exist? No, says Amazon Games' vice president Christoph Hartmann.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt has called upon the country's regulator to understand its "wider responsibilities" to promote economic growth, following its recent block of Microsoft's proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout.


The remarks, reported by The Telegraph, follow questions from MPs this week directed at bosses of the Competition and Markets Authority regarding the decision which has scuppered Microsoft's ambitions here in the UK - and potentially worldwide.


Both Microsoft and Activision have criticised the UK for disrupting the deal, and have labelled the country as being "bad for business" post-Brexit. The remarks come in stark contrast to the vision for the UK's tech industry previously set out by Hunt and UK prime minister Rishi Sunak to become the "Silicon Valley" of Europe.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) is a feature-rich
operator for Kubernetes to make managing seccomp, SELinux and
AppArmor profiles easier than ever. Recording those profiles from scratch is one
of the key features of this operator, which usually involves the integration
into large CI/CD systems. Being able to test the recording capabilities of the
operator in edge cases is one of the recent development efforts of the SPO and
makes it excitingly easy to play around with seccomp profiles.
Recording seccomp profiles with spoc record
The v0.8.0 release of the Security Profiles Operator shipped a new

replaying seccomp profiles among various other things that are out of scope of

As spotted by IGN, publisher Take-Two is predicting it will generate an absolutely staggering $8B in net bookings for its 2025 fiscal year (beginning April 2024), as it launches "several groundbreaking titles". That's a significant jump up from the $5.3B it's just reported for its financial year 2023, and an even bigger leap from the $3.5B it reported in the year prior, suggesting something major is due between next April and March 2025.


"For the last several years, we have been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success," Take-Two wrote in its earnings report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sky: Children of the Light, the acclaimed free-to-play "social adventure" from Journey and Flower developer ThatGameCompany, is making the jump to PC.


First released for iOS in 2019 - and later for Android, Switch, and PlayStation - Sky: Children of the Light is a bit of an unusual thing, blending all sorts of elements to create a delicate adventure spanning the seven realms of a beautiful kingdom located among the clouds.


There are puzzley-platformy bits, story vignettes, as well as live-service staples like a season pass, and it's all build around a gently collaborative multiplayer core, designed to encourage "compassion, friendship, and altruism".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlizzCon is back this November, with its first in-person event since 2019 following several years of digital-only events and no-shows as Blizzard navigated a pandemic and workplace controversy.


As announced on the Blizzard website, BlizzCon 2023 will take place from 3rd-4th November at California's Anaheim Convention Center. Beyond that, details are fairly non-existent at present, but the studio says it'll have news on "ticketing information, cosplay and other competition details, and more" next month.


BlizzCon 2023 will mark the show's first in-person event in four years, following two highly controversial showings in 2018 and 2019 - the first playing host to Blizzard's infamously bungled reveal of free-to-play mobile game Diablo Immortal and the second featuring a limp non-apology from then-CEO J. Allen Brack, who failed to offer much in the way of a convincing response after Blizzard suspended a Hearthstone player for expressing pro-Hong Kong views.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a month of teases, it looks like tomorrow's the day the next Mortal Kombat game - not Mortal Kombat 12, according to reports - will get its official reveal.


Series developer NetherRealm has now released a short video teasing some unspecified announcement tomorrow, 18th May, at 2pm BST/6am PT. And given its title - "Tomorrow is a new dawn" - and its arrival after a bunch of teases hinting at a reveal for the next Mortal Kombat, it doesn't seem too farfetched to assume that's exactly what we'll get.


As you'll no doubt have noticed if you've been riding the hype train so far, NetherRealm's latest video features the same time-based imagery seen in its previous trailers - the most recent of which saw a ticking clock gradually approach '12' before leapfrogging it entirely to land on '1'.

Jagged Alliance 3 was initially announced all the way back in 2004, when televisions still had dials and text messages were conveyed by pigeons. At the time, Russian studio MiST Land South was attached as its developer, but after that arrangement failed to reach fruition, original publisher Strategy First went through a succession of studios with similarly unsuccessful results before the Jagged Alliance rights changed hands in 2010.


Five years later, the rights pinballed again, this time to Nordic Games, and six years after that, THQ Nordic revealed that finally, finally, development on a third entry in the Jagged Alliance series would resume, this time under the watch of Tropico developer Haemimont Games.

Following the launch of this first episode, the game's following four episodes will then be released every two weeks, with the developer promising an Expanse experience "like never before".


The Expanse: A Telltale Series has been developed by Telltale and Deck Nine (Life is Strange: True Colors) and serves as a prequel to the popular sci-fi TV show. It features Camina Drummer as the main protagonist. Drummer works on The Artemis spaceship and, as you'd expect from a Telltale game, players will be tasked with making some tough decisions as she and her scavenger crew negotiate their way through the edges of The Belt.

This trailer first leaked online earlier in the month - though legal notices and a fairly successful community boycott stemmed its spread.  


Here we get our first look at The Hunger Games' Josh Hutcherson, cast as a new security guard for creepy pizza chain Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. An evil-looking Matthew Lillard (Scream, Scooby-Doo) can also be seen.

Originally a co-operative third-person shooter, the free-to-play game is now being described as a "PvPvE extraction shooter".


The change has been updated on the game's Steam page, along with a new blog post from executive producer Aleksander Grøndal giving more details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has not appealed the Austrian loot box verdict which ordered it to refund a number of Austrian FIFA players, after a court ruled that FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) packs constituted a form of gambling.

Earlier this year, a court in Hermagor ruled that the football game's FUT packs violated the country's gambling laws. At this time, lawyer Ulrich Salburg stated the plaintiffs - which included one minor - had allegedly "gambled away" hundreds of euros on FUT packs when the uncertain monetary value of the packs purportedly violated the Austrian Gaming Act.


Consequently, the court alleged that the controversial loot boxes could be classified as "illegal gambling".

Accessible via the Dead Space remake's Steam page, the new 90-minute trial version requires players to first install the full game then hit the "play now" button to begin their free trial period, whereupon a timer will keep track of the minutes still remaining.


There doesn't appear to be a progression cap on the trial, meaning players are free to continue as far as they can before their hour and a half expires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has cancelled Overwatch 2's much-trumpeted but long-delayed PvE mode, admitting development "hasn't made the progress we would have hoped."


PvE was presented as a flagship feature of Overwatch 2 when the team-based shooter sequel was unveiled in 2019, but, as development dragged on and 2022 arrived, Blizzard announced it would be "decoupling" PvE from PvP in order to get the game into players' hands sooner.


To that end, a fully PvP-focused version of Overwatch 2 finally launched last October, and little has been heard about its once-key PvE component in the months since. Now though, in a newly aired developer livestream, Overwatch 2 executive producer Jared Neuss has confirmed the game's PvE mode is officially dead.

The news comes as part of the publisher's Financial Year 2023 earnings report, the first earnings report since its disappointing quarterly update in January, in which it announced an "increased cautiousness over the coming years" and the cancellation of three unannounced projects.


In today's end-of-year report, Ubisoft recorded net bookings of €1.74B, marking an 18% year-on-year decrease for the publisher, but there were some notable wins for its biggest franchises, including a record number of active users for the Assassin's Creed franchise over the last year, coming it at 44% higher than Origins and 19% higher than Odyssey.

In response, the Sega heads explained that while AAA games "have been sold at $59.99 for many years", over the last year more titles have been "sold at $69.99".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has said it's feeling "really confident" Diablo 4 will enjoy a smooth launch following a series of server stress tests.


The developer held a "Server Slam" event over the weekend to test the upcoming action role-playing game's servers one final time ahead of launch in June. The event seemed to go smoothly, with most players reporting little to no queue time and, when in-game, improved performance compared to that seen in previous tests.


Speaking to Eurogamer in an interview in London today, Diablo 4 art director John Mueller and associate game director Joe Piepiora said Blizzard is feeling good about the launch because it had learned so much from the various tests.

CMA bosses Marcus Bokkerink and Sarah Cardell faced repeated questions from the UK government's Business and Trade Committee this morning relating to the decision, just a day after the European Commission voted to approve the deal in the EU.


MPs asked the CMA to explain why it had reached a different decision on the deal to its European counterpart, and repeatedly questioned whether the CMA had considered the effects of blocking a deal like this on the UK's international reputation.

Its somewhat simple design, which sees a collection of vacant containers for players to shoot their way around, is a mainstay of the series. However, the original map nearly didn't make its way into Call of Duty at all. As hard as it is to imagine now, Shipment's inclusion in 2007's Modern Warfare was "truly an accident".


Speaking to Dexerto, Infinity Ward multiplayer design director Geoff Smith shared more backstory on Shipment's genesis.

The blank, unblinking eyes, the polished sheen of his mask's surface - it all leads to Link looking like a serial killer. (And considering what some of you are doing to those poor Koroks, perhaps this isn't too far off.)


This is, of course, Link's design from the recent Nintendo Switch remake of classic Game Boy adventure The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. Except there, it was part of the game's cute toy diarama aesthetic. In Tears of the Kingdom, Link's longer body and glassy-eyed expression give off a very different vibe.

The game - currently a PlayStation console exclusive - has now received a new Xbox rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). 


As spotted by Twitter user @MACOS380, Stray has been rated as E for Everyone 10+, with the ESRB noting the game features animated blood and fantasy violence. "Players sometimes encounter parasitic blobs/mice-like bots that can attack and kill the cat. Players can access a UV light to defeat the mice-like bots, causing them to explode and emit splashes of coloured liquid," the rating summary explains.

With Kubernetes 1.27, we (SIG Auth) are moving Key Management Service (KMS) v2 API to beta.
What is KMS?
One of the first things to consider when securing a Kubernetes cluster is encrypting etcd data at
rest. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to
perform this encryption.
KMS v1 has been a feature of Kubernetes since version 1.10, and is currently in beta as of version
v1.12. KMS v2 was introduced as alpha in v1.25.

the previous blog post

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a good long while since we first laid eyes on dreamy Ecuadorian football adventure Despelote, but now, after several years away from the spotlight, it's resurfaced with a publisher and a planned 2024 release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.


Created by Julián Cordero and Sebastian Valbuena, Despelote is described as a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life adventure about "childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001". It's set during a period when the country's football team was on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time, helping instil a sense of hope in a population still reeling from a major financial crisis. 


That translates to "bittersweet and sometimes dreamy" game of kick-abouts and conversations, in which sees players - viewing the world through the eyes and ears of eight-year-old Julián - explore a dense corner of Quito, "full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to".

The original Hawken burst onto the scene back in 2011 with an eye-catching work-in-progress trailer, but it struggled to find an audience once out in the real world. A failed early access attempt in 2014 saw development stall until a "relaunch" in 2017, but even that wasn't enough to get bums in mechs, and the game's PC servers were yanked for good the following year.


Which does make Hawken something of an odd choice for a revival, but here we are, five years later, with the free-to-play Hawken Reborn now listed on Steam and poised to launch into early access as a "genuinely early-in-development" title this Wednesday, 17th May.

Bloodhunt was announced toward the end of 2020 and, following a limited Steam early access release, recieved its full launch on PlayStation and PC last April. It offered players a vampiric spin on the well-worn battle royale formula, setting them loose across the rain-soaked, moon-drenched streets and rooftops of Prague, armed with supernatural parkour abilities and other clan-specific powers - plus, rather more boringly, guns.


It made for an interesting twist on a familiar genre - even if Eurogamer's Robert Purchese didn't much like the whole shooty thing when he played it back in early access - but that clearly wasn't enough to attact and retain the kind of player base Bloodhunt needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Molasses Flood, the CD-Projekt-owned studio currently working on The Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, has been hit by layoffs following the game's recent reboot.


Development on Project Sirius - previously described as a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience - was confirmed to have stalled back in March, after CD Projekt re-evaluated the "scope and commercial potential of the original concept". At the time, the company told investors it was "formulating a new framework" for the game that was better "aligned with [its] strategy".


Last week, CD Projekt shared an update on Project Sirius, announcing its "work on defining a new framework" was now complete. But that news was followed by growing reports of layoffs at the Boston-based The Molasses Flood, which was acquired by CD Projekt in 2021, with the studio's technical narrative designer Robert Bailey, environment artist Eleanore Falck, senior environment artist and world builder Gannon Jasper, and art producer Caryn M. Boehm, all revealing they had lost their jobs in tweets shared since last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having left us a vague "June" launch window for its Layers of Fear remake over the last few months, developer Bloober Team is finally ready to talk specifics, confirming its "psychedelic horror chronicle" will be releasing for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 15th June.


Layers of Fear is a bit of an unusual proposition, taking Bloober Team's two previous Layers of Fear titles (as well as the first game's Inheritance DLC), then reimagining it all as a single, interlinking narrative, featuring striking Unreal Engine 5 visuals, new gameplay elements - including a lantern to ward off shadowy terrors - and expanded plot lines.


This time around, the familiar unravellings of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece and a legendary actor making one final movie on a labyrinthine ocean liner - as featured in Layers of Fear 1 and 2 respectively - are accompanied by a new "story chapter" following the painter's rarely seen wife, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer, tying the whole thing together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon has announced fresh plans to adapt The Lord of the Rings into a new MMO "adventure", developed in-house by the studio behind New World, for PC and consoles.


The project will feature "the beloved stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings", adapted from Tolkien's original books, as licensed by rights owner Embracer. (Don't expect this to tie-in specifically with the Peter Jackson movie trilogy, or even Amazon's own Rings of Power show, set a thousand years before.)


"Bringing players a fresh take on The Lord of the Rings has long been an aspiration for our team, and we're honoured and grateful that Middle-earth Enterprises is entrusting us with this iconic world," Amazon Games boss Christoph Harmann said. "We're also pleased to be expanding our relationship with Embracer Group following our Tomb Raider deal last year, as they've proven to be excellent collaborators."

According to 3D artist Thomas of Twitter account Stylized Station, there is a lot involved to get it just right. It takes "a ton of smoke and mirrors in the background, without anyone ever realising it," they explained in a very thorough Twitter thread, noting "creating real-time simulated water is still really hard to do".


Thomas stated that most developers use a variety of "cheats" and techniques that see things such as textures, VFX sprites, normal maps, and basic geometry "smashed together" in order to give the "illusion of flowing water".

The European Commission had been one of three major regulators standing in the way of the deal, alongside the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - the latter of which dramatically blocked the deal last month, dealing a sizable blow to it succeeding overall. Microsoft is now set to appeal that decision.


In Brussels, however, it's better news for Microsoft - after a couple of concessions ended up winning over EU regulators.

Link is also making his merry way through Hyrule's many regions and camps in a range of eclectic creations, from mechs to trucks and tanks.


As a reminder, Link's new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects, and with a bit of creativity players can conjure up their own vehicles and such to beetle across Hyrule. 


While I have been happy enough to just place a fan on the back of my timber board to make it go, others clearly have a much better imagination (and a lot more patience, I won't lie, I am still finding Ultrahand quite fiddly to get the hang of) than I do. As a result, there have been some truly remarkable Ultrahand designs making the rounds online.

As with its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, Link can search the lands of Hyrule to find these woodland spirits, and return the seeds to Hestu. As in Breath of the Wild, Hestu will then add these seeds to his prized maracas, do a little shimmy, and grant you a new weapon slot. It's all very wholesome. 


Or, at least it was in Breath of the Wild. However, Tears of the Kingdom has upped the ante when it comes to Korok puzzles. This time around, Link often has to reunite two separated Korok companions. This sounds innocent enough - who doesn't want to see two long lost friends reunited? Well, apparently many Tears of the Kingdom players, that's who. 


Thanks to the sequel's new Ultrahand ability, which allows Link to pick up, move, and rotate objects (including Koroks), many players out there have taken to fusing these poor blighters to homemade crucifixes, rockets and even spit roasting the innocent spirits.

Aonuma agreed Ocarina of Time did create a format but it was ultimately restrictive for the designers, while Breath of the Wild offered a new type of play.

cluster administrators may face.
This blog post focuses on methods to speed up pod start-up from the kubelet side. It does not
involve the creation time of pods by controller-manager through kube-apiserver, nor does it
include scheduling time for pods or webhooks executed on it.
We have mentioned some important factors here to consider from the kubelet's perspective, but
this is not an exhaustive list. As Kubernetes v1.27 is released, this blog highlights
significant changes in v1.27 that aid in speeding up pod start-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the biggest boxed video game launch of the year so far in the UK.

According to our sister site GamesIndustry.biz, that makes it the series' biggest ever launch week in the UK, surpassing the launches of even early games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time which were only available physically at the time. 

According to GI and the GfK charts, Tears of the Kingdom's instant pole position pushes Hogwarts Legacy from its top spot, and moves Star Wars Jedi: Survivor into third place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metacritic has finally opened The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom open to user reviews, and over three hundred players have left mixed or negative feedback.

Although The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now the highest-rated game of the year thus far on Metacritic - and the highest-rated game of all time on OpenCritic – and industry analysts are opining that Nintendo's all-new adventure will impact the charts not just for the next few months, but "years", some fans are making their disappointment more than clear, and whilst the critic score sits at a lofty 96, the user score aggregated from over 1600 reviewers is 8.5.

Yes, admittedly, some people are devastated that you cannot pet the dog, but that doesn't account for the hundreds of reviews that cite the sequel hasn't address the purported issues of its predecessor, calls the gameplay "boring", or reports ongoing performance issues.

Developer Soda Den took to social media over the weekend to claim that the game was removed "without [its] knowledge or consent" following "issues" with publisher Crytivo.

"As you may have noticed, the Roots of Pache Steam page is temporarily offline," the statement begins. "We are sad to report that we have been engaged in a dispute with Crytivo over the rights to Roots of Pacha. We worked hard to amicably resolve our issue with Crytivo internally. Instead of working with us to address the issue, Crytivo went to Valve and authorised them to remove Roots of Pacha from Steam without our knowledge or consent.

That's according to industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who took to Twitter to reflect on Tears of the Kingdom's legacy both in relation to its predecessor Breath of the Wild, and the charts more generally. 

"Sometimes I wonder if a game can last a few months on the top 20 best-seller charts," he tweeted ahead of the game's release earlier this week.

Epic Games stopped short of confirming it outright, of course, but instead dropped a mysterious tweet and a 20-second video teaser that declares that "a new way to grab the Victory Royale is coming", inviting you to "rise through the ranks".

The real clue, however, is in that accompanying video; whilst short, it seems to take us through eight different ranks, seemingly starting at bronze and progressing through silver, gold and more until it goes all the way to… I don't know, super-duper-platinum or something.

Perhaps thankfully (I say this as someone who spends a lot of time on The Sims 4 subreddits), this isn't a free-for-all, and voters must operate within some extremely rigid parameters.


EA is specifically canvassing players to decide on the themes of two upcoming Kit packs, one focused around Create-a-Sim fashion and the other around building.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steve Gaynor, the controversial co-founder of Gone Home and Tacoma developer Fullbright, is now going it alone under the Fullbright name following accusations of toxic workplace behaviour in August 2021.


Gaynor made headlines at the time after an exodus of 15 staff at Fullbright was, in part, blamed on his behaviour towards fellow workers. An investigation by Polygon claimed Gaynor was "controlling", and that staff, particularly women, frequently felt "undermined and demeaned", disparaged and discredited.


Soon after, Gaynor publicly acknowledged his "leadership style was hurtful to people that worked at Fullbright", and announced he would be stepping back from the day-to-day development of the studio's latest game, Open Roads. A separate statement from Fullbright confirmed Gaynor would also be vacating his role as the studio's creative lead and manager.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Frictional Games has announced another short delay for its intriguing "unscripted" WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker, but it's also releasing a little something to tide fans over between now and its new 6th June arrival date in the form of a demo soon coming to Steam.


Amnesia: The Bunker - the fourth game in the Amnesia series, following on from The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, and Rebirth - has seen a number of delays this year as Frictional puts the finishing touches to the experience, and the developer has now made the decision to push its release back another two weeks, from 23rd May to 6th June.


In a short statement announcing the news, Frictional attributed the latest delay to "unforeseen certification issues". The decision, it said, was "crucial to ensure we do not ship the game with these issues", adding the extra time afforded by the delay will allow it to "rectify the problem and ensure the best possible gameplay experience on release".

An eye-catching run from YouTuber gymnast86, posted this morning, shows the game beaten in just 94 minutes. This is an any% speedrun with no assists from amiibo.


What's interesting here is nearly half of the run covers the game's opening portion without any major shortcuts. Even with knowledge of where to go and how to do it, this takes over 40 minutes.

<blockquote><p>The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you&#8217;ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans­&#8212;one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn&#8217;t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you weren't aware, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released today. Along with the sequel's new-look Hyrule, Link also has a range of new abilities that can help him on his journey to once again rid the kingdom of the many evils that have made their home there. 


One such ability is Ascend, which allows Link to pass through solid objects above him. This is a game changer when it comes to traversal, as Link no longer has to necessarily negotiate the weather and his stamina to make his way up cliffs and the like. Now, he can find some kind of overhang and pop up and through to create seemingly impossible shortcuts. 


However, this useful new ability wasn't always going to make it into Tears of the Kingdom's final release. In fact, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma and game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi revealed it actually started off as a debug cheat function not intended for the game.

The ocean moon of Saturn was cruelly cut from Destiny 2 alongside several other destinations back in 2020, as developer Bungie sought to trim the amount of content it had to keep up to date. It was an unpopular decision, and one it has now ceased.


Some of that content has since been re-added, with Titan looking set to make a reappearance in the upcoming Season of the Deep. Here's a quick teaser:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My copy of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is currently "out for delivery", and expected to arrive sometime this afternoon. It is now afternoon, and there's still no sign of it. To save myself from twiddling my thumbs while staring mindlessly at the wall, I decided to check out Flappy Souls.

Flappy Souls is a new, free release on Steam. It is marketed as being "a mix of Flappy Bird and Dark Souls", hence the name. The premise is remarkably simple - you have to fly around as a baseball cap-wearing bird while dodging obstacles. Smattered through these obstacles are souls that you have to collect, and as you progress you level up. And that's it. Easy, right? No, not right. This game is HARD! 


Now, before I get too into it, let me ask - are you the kind of person who ducks a little when you go under a low bridge in a car? I am. For some reason, I have it hardwired into my brain that physically ducking will somehow ensure safer passage. Logically, of course, I know it makes absolutely no sense. If my car isn't going to fit, me ducking, or breathing in when I pass another vehicle on a slightly narrower stretch of road, isn't going to change that. And yet, I still do it.

This eclectic menagerie of characters all come from Tenacious D's latest music video, for a song aptly named "Video Games". Animated versions of Black and Kyle Gass begin the promo in a fairly normal way. The duo are in a studio, with Black singing into his mic while Gass strums on his animated guitar. Soon, however, things become chaoticly brilliant.


It starts with Gass getting squashed by God of War's Dauði Kaupmaðr, and Black fleeing the scene only to find himself in the middle of Fallout 4 (as one does). The rest of the video then sees the duo becoming Sonic and Tails, Red Dead cowboys and more. As I have said, it is brilliant, as you can see for yourself below.

Fans have long called for Zelda to take on more of an active role in the series she gives her name to. And more recently, Zelda has indeed been playable in spin-offs such as Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Age of Calamity.


But the main Zelda series has remained steadfast at always casting Link as the hero, and Zelda herself as someone kept largely off-screen. (And that's all we'll say here, where there shall be no Tears of the Kingdom spoilers.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Call of Duty is Modern Warfare 3 and is due out 10th November on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, according to a report by Insider Gaming.


The game is pitched as a "fully-fledged sequel" to last year's Modern Warfare 2, with development led by Vanguard maker Sledgehammer Games and support provided by Activision's many Call of Duty studios.


Apparently all the modes you'd expect from a full-blown Call of Duty game are included, such as campaign, multiplayer and zombies ("essentially an Outbreak 2.0" that may or may not be free-to-play). There's a new Warzone 2 map planned for later in the year based on the Las Almas map from the Modern Warfare 2 campaign.

The showrunners were making casting preparations for The Last of Us' second season up until earlier this week, when it was put on hold, Variety reports.


According to sources familiar with the matter, up until this point the casting team had been asking actors to read sides taken "directly" from The Last of Us Part 2, PlayStation's 2020 release that the second season will be based on, during auditions, as there are currently no scripts for the show itself.

Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said Switch will remain at its current price point despite entering its seventh year on sale, due to inflation and foreign exchange rates. 


As for the potential of a price rise - as Sony did for PlayStation 5 last summer - Nintendo did not entirely rule it out.

If you have deployed Kubernetes pods with CPU and/or memory resources
specified, you may have noticed that changing the resource values involves
restarting the pod. This has been a disruptive operation for running
workloads... until now.
In Kubernetes v1.27, we have added a new alpha feature that allows users
to resize CPU/memory resources allocated to pods without restarting the
containers. To facilitate this, the resources field in a pod's containers
now allow mutation for cpu and memory resources. They can be changed
simply by patching the running pod spec.
This also means that resources field in the pod spec can no longer be
relied upon as an indicator of the pod's actual resources. Monitoring tools
and other such applications must now look at n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In anticipation of its June arrival on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC, Bloober Team's Layers of Fear remake is getting a "short" playable demo on Steam next Monday, 15th May.


Bloober's updated version of Layers of Fear, which was initially announced under the name Layers of Fears, is being co-developed with Anshar Studios. It sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 all rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 and reimagined as a single, generations-spanning "psychedelic horror chronicle".


Both previously released games - which respectively chart the gradual unravellings of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece and a legendary actor making one final movie on a labyrinthine ocean liner - get some striking new visuals in the reboot, alongside new gameplay and expanded plot lines. And there's a new framing device tying the whole lot together, focusing on a new lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer.

Project Sirius - a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience being developed by The Flame and the Flood studio Molasses Flood - was announced last October as part of CD Projekt's ambitious studio roadmap, which included a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, a new IP, the next Witcher trilogy, and a remake of the first Witcher game.


However, March brought the news work on Project Sirius had stalled after CD Projekt had re-evaluated the "scope and commercial potential of the original concept". At the time, the company told investors it was in the process of "formulating a new framework" for the game that was better "aligned with [its] strategy".

Summer Game Fest officially begins on 8th June with a live showcase promising a mix of premieres, gameplay demos, and announcements, but it'll continue on well after that, with various other industry events and showcases - including those previously announced by Xbox and Ubisoft - set to fall under the Summer Game Fest banner throughout the season.


That's about as much detail as we'd heard previously, but the official Summer Game Fest Twitter account has now revealed a sizeable list of game companies confirmed to be taking part in some capacity, including big names like PlayStation, Xbox, Capcom, Sega, CD Projekt, Bandai Namco, EA, Epic Games, Netflix, Activision, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Warner Bros.

We first caught a glimpse of the ROG Ally on 1st April this year, but Asus was quick to confirm the device was not, in fact, a weirdly elaborate April Fool's Day prank, but rather an actual real thing it was planning to release.


A few weeks later, Asus was ready to talk specs, confirming the ROG Ally would include an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor, a seven-inch 1080p 120Hz touch screen, a UHS-2 Micro SD card slot, plus Windows 11 support, and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It also promised "up to" 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM in dual-channel mode and storage of "up to" 512GB PCIe 4.0 SSD, although it offered little word on other planned configurations.

Announced back in 2020, Goodbye Volcano High - which follows the adventures of a group of teen dinosaurs as they learn to live and love in a world teetering on the bring of destruction - was originally expected to launch in 2021, but a narrative reboot and the global pandemic saw KO_OP shift its release into 2023.


Earlier this year, it seemed an end was finally in sight when KO_OP slapped it with a 15th June release date, but the studio has now opted to push the game's launch back by another ten weeks "after assessing its production schedule".

In a video posted to his YouTube channel, embedded below, Cain revealed the idea behind the vaults and their various dastardly experiments was to help scientists figure out how humans might survive interstellar travel - an idea he conveived after Fallout 1 came out in 1997.


Deciding there would be "no earth to come back to" in the event of a nuclear war, the head of the Enclave and the US government hatched a plan to build a starship that would take "our best and brightest" to a distant solar system in the hope of colonising a suitable planet.

In it, Nintendo asks respondees to rate their knowledge of the Pikmin series so far (fairly strong), their impressions of Pikmin 4's recent marketing (it's been OK), and what they'd be keen to hear more about as its 21st July release date nears.


This last part is most interesting to me, as it touches on a few features Nintendo has only hinted at so far. This includes "delving into puzzle-filled caves, and carefully managing your resources until you escape" plus "embarking on night-time missions that feature new and intense gameplay".

"While playing it safe and a tad predictable, Tequila Works carefully layers on new gimmicks and mechanics as you progress through Gylt, allowing you to organically build on your knowledge and start experimenting," Vikki wrote in Eurogamer's Gylt review.

The image emerged yesterday on the @BKTOOR4 Twitter account, apparently from a datamine. It didn't take long for Activision to haul the tweet offline, but of course the internet noticed.


According to Charlie Intel, this new Resurgence map is called Vondel and is set in The Netherlands, which should make for a welcome palette-cleanser following the sandy Al Mazrah map and the current Ashika Island Resurgence map.

This comic was announced last week, along with the standalone PlayStation 5 version of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. After a brief time of being available in US comic book stores, the entire thing is now online for free. 


I have had a read of the comic myself, and it is a nice, pretty condensed, standalone story that should help fill some of the void between now and Marvel's Spider-Man 2's eventual debut (don't worry, I am not going to spoil anything here). If you are interested in having a read of what Peter Parker and co. have been getting up to ahead of Marvel's Spider-Man 2's release, you can check out the online version of the comic here.

The game will see you play as John Mouston, a private detective sniffing out corruption and rogue rodents. Inspired by rubber hose animation, John Mouston bears some resemblance to Walt Disney's beloved Mickey Mouse. Indeed, he has the long snout(is that correct terminology?) with a round nose, the big ears and the white gloves. But he also has a revolver and cigars, so he's definitely not Mickey Mouse.


The gameplay we've seen so far gives me Doom vibes, whilst the vending machines remind me a lot of BioShock. I'd be lying if I said it doesn't look fun to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bella Ramsey, perhaps best known on this site for playing Ellie in HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, has briefly hung up her shivs and bricks to take Gran Turismo 7 for a test drive. 


Ramsey, who has previously spoken about her repeated attempts to get a driving licence, is now promoting Sony's racing sim on the PSVR2. "I am about to take my fifth driving test," the actor begins, before admitting she is a bit nervous about the whole ordeal. It should all be ok, right? Because, after all, Ramsey has a nice PSVR2 set and Gran Turismo 7, so she'll get plenty of practice.


Cut to Ramsey tearing her way round Gran Turismo 7's race tracks in her new VR wheels, with an appropriate amount of whooping and mock road rage. But alas, these new found tactics and moves do not work in the real world, and Ramsey does not pass her driving test. "You were doing 80 in a 30," her driving instructor explains. It's a really fun advert, so do check it out for yourself below.

In Kubernetes, a Service can be used to provide a unified traffic endpoint for
applications running on a set of Pods. Clients can use the virtual IP address (or VIP) provided
by the Service for access, and Kubernetes provides load balancing for traffic accessing
different back-end Pods, but a ClusterIP type of Service is limited to providing access to
nodes within the cluster, while traffic from outside the cluster cannot be routed.
One way to solve this problem is to use a type: NodePort Service, which sets up a mapping
to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, thus redirecting traffic from the
outside to the inside of the cluster.
How Kubernetes allocates node ports to Services?
When a type: NodePort Service is created, its corresponding port(s) are al…]]></summary>

NetherRealm shared a first teaser at the start of this month, appended to a video celebrating Mortal Kombat's 30th anniversary. It showed sands steadily trickling through an hourglass before a sudden camera zoom focused in on the very last grain, which then exploded.


It's now been four years since the launch of Mortal Kombat 11, and news-starved fans immediately began speculating NetherRealm's mysterious video was in some way teasing an imminent reveal for Mortal Kombat 12 - with one theory suggesting Kronika's time-and-space-altering hourglass, which featured prominently in the previous game, may have gone awry, somehow resetting the universe.

First revealed back in 2020, Dordogne casts players as 32-year-old Mimi who, at the start of the game, returns to the home of her recently deceased grandmother in the titular French province, where she begins to reflect on the summers of her youth.


From there, the adventure splits across two timelines; in one, present-day Mimi explores her grandmother's home, rifling through souvenirs and solving puzzles, while ten-year-old Mimi faces her own challenges, from forest walks and climbing to kayaking and cave explorations.

Dungeons! Mitherflipping dungeons are returning in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom!


More specifically - according to Nintendo's Hidemaro Fujibayashi, speaking in a new Ask the Developer interview - "huge", "traditional" dungeons are making their return to the Legend of Zelda series in Tears of the Kingdom after their conspicuous absence in Breath of the Wild.


Tears of the Kingdom's predecessor saw Nintendo shake up the traditional Zelda formula in a big way, not just in its sprawling open-world, but by replacing lengthy, elaborate dungeons - which have been part of the Zelda series since its inception in 1986 - with micro-dungeon-like Shrines and more expansive, although largely forgettable, Divine Beasts.

According to Reuters, the regulator is set to approve the deal sometime next week. Sources familiar with the matter said 15th May (next Monday) is the likeliest date for this, however the EC's own deadline for its decision on Microsoft's proposed deal is still set for 22nd May.


The regulator had previously announced a provisional deadline of 25th April for its decision on the potential takeover, but that date shifted to May after Microsoft submitted remedies in its efforts to gain approval from regulatory bodies.

In short, Eurogamer is moving to a five-star review rating system, beginning this week.  


For years now, I've felt our existing review badges weren't working hard enough for us, or for you. We ended up recommending a lot of games, or not giving a badge at all to many others - which meant readers not acquainted with our odd four-point scale had nothing to go on. We rarely used Avoid, because it always felt a bit mean.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has added a rather unique warning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor players who try to bypass its story elements. 


Many out there enjoy the challenge of exploiting games in such a way that will allow them to progress through a story quicker. Speedrunning communities exist to share tricks and glitches that sometimes see entire areas skipped - because someone managed to crouch next to that one specific bit of wall while holding that one specific sword in their left hand (or something like that).


EA is clearly aware of this, and has implemented an in-game message that triggers if a player reaches an area that should be, in theory, unreachable at that point in the game. Should this happen, a warning will pop up on the player's screen stating "an unexpected error" has occurred.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released a new advert for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and on my first watch through I had my video game news reporter hat on, looking closely at the gameplay moments for fresh clues. 


My efforts didn't really bring up much new. I now know that for your Ultrahand-made raft to not topple over in the water, you need to make sure it is balanced by some support logs on either side. But that really is about it in terms of gameplay analysis. 


Then I watched it again, and this time my mind was drawn not to Link gadabouting through the sky, but to the real life, "everyday" man the advert actually focuses on. It is quite clear what (or who) Nintendo is trying to paint a picture of here.

Team Cherry had planned to launch Silksong before July this year. Spokesperson Matthew Griffin last night admitted via Twitter that development was "still continuing" and the team wanted to "take the time to make the game as good as we can".


Another reason for the delay? Silksong has also now "gotten quite big", Griffin said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced its latest financial earning, confirming record net bookings of $1.95B for its most recent quarter - and, alas, the news that BioWare's highly anticipated Dragon Age: Dreadwolf won't be out until at least April next year.


Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which has been in some form of development since at least 2017, has never been given an official release date, but reports last year suggested BioWare was targeting a late 2023 launch for the long-awaited title.


Hopes for a 2023 release among fans remained unabated when, last October, the studio confirmed Dreadwolf had reached the alpha stage of development and was playable "to the very end" - but those hopes have now been dashed through omission, via EA's newly revealed release schedule for the current financial year.

Details of the title are limited, but the companies have shared an unexpectedly moody bit of concept art to accompany today's news, showcasing a character adorned in something like traditional Japanese garb amid a forest of towering trees.


"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work," Game Freak director Kota Furushima said in a statement. "From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise give us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future."

Dark and Darker received a hugely positive reception when it made a Steam Next Fest appearance earlier this year, but things went quickly awry.


In March, Nexon accused Ironmace of "using materials and assets they worked on during their time" at Nexon to create Dark and Darker, soon after issuing a cease and desist demand which resulted in the game's removal from Steam. This has forced the developer to get creative as it continues to release new playtest builds to players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie's winning streak against Destiny 2 cheat sellers continues with the news it's now been awarded $6.7m USD in damages following a ruling in its lawsuit against LaviCheats.


Bungie filed its claim against LaviCheats owner Kunal Bansal back in 2021, alongside lawsuits against two other cheat sellers: Elite Tech Boss and VeteranCheats. Elite Boss Tech agreed to settle last July, paying $13.5m in damages, and a court ruled against VeteranCheats earlier this month, ordering it to pay Bungie $12m USD in damages.


That just left the developer's case against LaviCheats and (as spotted by TorrentFreak) a federal court in Washington has now issued a default judgment against the India-based Bansal - as requested in a motion filed by Bungie earlier this year - after he failed to appear in court.

The CMA recently made the shock decision to block Microsoft's $68.7bn acquisition of Activision following its months-long investigation, citing concerns over the deal's impact on the cloud gaming sector, which it said risked "stifling competition in this growing market".


In response, Microsoft announced it would be appealing the CMA's decision, while Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick told staff the move would "stifle investment, competition, and job creation throughout the UK gaming industry", insisting "it is far from the final word on this deal".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty fans have heavily criticised Activision for a newly-released "pay-to-win" bundle deemed the most egregious so far.


The Roze and Thorn bundle includes the Thorns Out Roze operator skin. This skin spawns players with a free UAV bonus effect for the popular extraction mode, DMZ.


In Call of Duty, a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) reveals enemy locations on the mini-map for 30 seconds - a particularly useful ability in a game that involves player versus environment versus player elements. The effect is potentially pronounced in squad play, where up to six can team up.

That's according to GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring, who revealed Jedi: Survivor's digital downloads accounted for almost double the amount Fallen Order managed.


Dring noted that even though Survivor's physical sales were down on Fallen Order's, overall sales were markedly up from EA's 2019 release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, following in the footsteps of the Fallout games, has cheesy post-sex pillow talk.


Confirmation comes from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which in its Starfield rating summary spilled the beans that Bethesda's next game not only lets players have sex, but splutter lines of dialogue after the deed.


This "suggestive material", as the ESRB puts it, includes moral panic-inducing lines such as "Life is a sexually transmitted disease that's a hundred percent fatal"; "I'm all for getting a little wild, but next time let's try it without the jetpacks"; and "Talk about seeing stars, whew... that was amazing".

Nintendo painted a mixed picture in its latest financial results, with hardware sales now definitively past the console's peak as the Switch enters its seventh year of life. 


That said, game sales remain strong - down only slightly on the console's last two years in terms of first-party software like Pokémon and Splatoon, and still well up on 2020 and everything before that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of anticipation, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's release is now only a few days away. In order to make sure everyone is up to speed on what happened across Hyrule ahead of the sequel's debut, Nintendo has released a video recapping Breath of the Wild's story.


If you have a spare six-and-a-bit minutes, this video is a nice digestible way to relive the game's plot. After all, Breath of the Wild did release six years ago, so a little refresher perhaps wouldn't go amiss.  


As you would expect, Nintendo's video covers everything from the four champions, some of the various enemies that Ganon has doing his bidding, and Zelda helping Link out in Breath of the Wild's final confrontation. But that's enough from me. Go and make yourself a quick brew and have a watch of Nintendo's Breath of the Wild recap for yourself below.

Hi-Fi Rush players will be familiar with Chai's couch, on which he can snuggle robot cat 808, have a snooze or have a little chat with himself as he decompresses from the action-packed missions.

This week sees the arrival of the game's fourth patch, which addresses a variety of issues, both platform specific and across all versions of the game. 


With this patch in play, PC users can expect to see updated occlusion behaviour for raytracing, which will reduce idle time stalls. EA has also updated its PC streaming budgets, something the developer says will help alleviate traversal hitching. The team has also implemented general performance improvements for "some VFX" (this update will also be coming "soon" to console versions of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor). Lastly on the PC specific updates (for today, at least), EA has updated the data handling when toggling raytracing, improving non-raytraced performance.

Declarative configuration management with the kubectl apply command is the gold standard approach
to creating or modifying Kubernetes resources. However, one challenge it presents is the deletion
of resources that are no longer needed. In Kubernetes version 1.5, the --prune flag was
introduced to address this issue, allowing kubectl apply to automatically clean up previously
applied resources removed from the current configuration.
Unfortunately, that existing implementation of --prune has design flaws that diminish its
performance and can result in unexpected behaviors. The main issue stems from the lack of explicit
encoding of the previously applied set by the preceding apply operation, necessitating

More specifically, Dinosaur Polo Club is marking ten years since the studio first hit upon the idea for Mini Metro during a Ludum Dare Game Jam, creating an early iteration of the game that would go on to make a major splash the following year.


Since then we've seen a successor in 2019's majestic Mini Motorways, and Dinosaur Polo Club is now preparing the mother of all crossovers, announcing it'll be bringing three Mini Metro maps into Mini Motorways, with three maps also going the other way in its big July update.

Volume group snapshot is introduced as an Alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.27.
This feature introduces a Kubernetes API that allows users to take crash consistent
snapshots for multiple volumes together. It uses a label selector to group multiple
PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting.
This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers.
An overview of volume group snapshots
Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of
multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents “copies” from multiple volumes that
are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate
new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to
a previous state (represented by the snapshots).

According to Axios and a recent court filing, 1548 women have received a payment of between $2500 and $5000 (£1977 - £3950) at Riot, whilst hundreds of Activision employees are also receiving payouts for a separate, but similar, settlement.

Last Year – which was originally developed by Elastic Games and "amassed a passionate player base and hundreds of thousands of downloads since it first launched as a Discord exclusive in 2018" – has been "reborn" by new developer Undaunted Games and returned to Steam as a free-to-play title.

"We've always believed in the potential of this title," says Undaunted Games studio head and producer, Matthew Itovitch. "When we did the marketing for the game at PAX East and West in 2018, we saw the reactions from players, and also what this game could be. Last Year definitely deserves another shot at realising that, and bringing back the game is the first step."

"Get ready, Legend of Zelda fans!" Nintendo announced on the Nintendo of America Twitter account. "We will be hosting a special livestream leading up to the @NintendoNYC midnight launch of the Legend of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amnesia: The Bunker, the new "unscripted" WW1 horror from SOMA developer Frictional Games, is almost upon us following a number of delays, and with its 23rd May release date looming, the studio has shared 10 new minutes of gameplay to ponder.


The Bunker, for a bit of context, is the fourth game in Frictional's Amnesia series, which began with 2010's acclaimed The Dark Descent. Since then we've seen a Chinese-Room-developed successor in 2013's A Machine for Pigs, and Frictional returned to the series in 2021 with its ambitious Amnesia: Rebirth, set in the Algerian desert. 


Frictional's latest, Amnesia: The Bunker, marks a notable departure for the series, trading traditionally linear tales of horror for "unscripted" scares in a nightmarish semi-open-world as players - in the role of French solider Henri Clément - attempt to flee a relentless, "adaptive" otherworldly creature through the claustrophobic confines of the titular subterranean space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia, the acclaimed - and previously Epic Games Store exclusive - survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is making its way to Steam with a first-person mode and other new features later this year.


Saturnalia originally released last October, taking players on a journey through the ancient, ever-shifting town of the title in adventure heavily inspired by Sardinia folklore.


The gist is players - switching between four different characters at will - must explore, avoid the things in the shadows, and solve the mystery of Saturnalia in order to earn their freedom. Only, should all four characters die, the town will reassert itself, reconfiguring its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

Based in San Mateo, California, PixelOpus was established with the express purpose of giving young developers a start in the industry, and was formally announced as a new internal Sony studio in 2014. It would go on to release its first game, the striking Entwined, that same year.


While PixelOpus' initial outing received a mixed critical reception, its follow-up title, Concrete Genie, fared much better in 2019. It was nominated for a BAFTA Artistic Achievement award, and Eurogamer called it a "small, perfectly formed adventure" in our Recommended review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has announced a 20% price increase for Destiny 2's standalone season pass, but the studio says its all-in-one Annual Pass won't be affected by the move.


Destiny 2 first added a battle-pass-style Season Pass as part of its third year of content, back in 2019. Since then, each three-month-long Season Pass has been priced at 1,000 Silver (approximately £9/$10 USD depending on premium currency bundle), making this the first price bump since their introduction.


Bungie's newly announced 20% price increase - which won't affect the Lightfall standard edition season pass or Lightfall and Annual Pass edition - means each new Season Pass will now cost 1,200 Silver. Additionally, Destiny 2's Season Pass + 10 Ranks Bundle will cost 2,200 Silver instead of 2,000.

We also look beyond Redfall at the pressure now on Microsoft to deliver with Starfield, following various first-party delays and disappointments over the past few years. As Xbox takes stock of its progress this console generation, big questions remain over how it competes in the years to come - with some potentially gloomy (for Microsoft) answers. 
Joining me to share their thoughts are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the fallout from Redfall's release continues, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has raised eyebrows with his claim that Microsoft expected the game to score much better in critics' reviews. 


During a wide-ranging interview with Kinda Funny, Spencer said Xbox had planned for Redfall to land with an average review score "double digits" higher than the one it actually got.


"We do mock reviews for every game we launch, and this is double digits lower than we thought we would be with this game," Spencer said. "That's one of the disappointing things. We would never strive to launch a game that we thought was going to review in the low-60s. It's not part of our goals."

According to IGN, the Hollywood movie star is in final negotiations to play the video game movie star in the sequel to 2021's popular Mortal Kombat film.


For me, Urban is an odd pick for Johnny Cage. In the Mortal Kombat games Cage is a clean cut, quick-witted action movie star whose vanity is matched only by his star-studded smile. When I think of Karl Urban, I think of all his gruff, beardy roles, such as Judge Dredd in the wonderful Dredd movie, the superhero hating Billy Butcher, and the hairy rider of Rohan, Éomer in The Lord of the Rings. For Cage, I'm thinking Ryan Gosling's Ken or Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool, without the suit.

Microsoft's Xbox Series X and S currently lag behind Sony's PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch, with sales struggling.


And after the disastrous launch of Redfall - something Spencer has personally apologised for - Microsoft faces increasingly tough questions over Microsoft's ability to regularly release high quality triple-A games, and the future growth of subscription service Game Pass.

So, this is your last chance to get your hands on some PS4 classics such as Bloodborne, Until Dawn, The Last of Us Remastered and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End before the collection is disbanded for good. 


The PlayStation Plus Collection was introduced back in 2020 as a curated selection of great PS4 games that PlayStation 5 owners would be able to download and play on their new generation consoles. 


However, on 9th May, the following 19 PS4 games will be removed from PS Plus, as Sony is removing the collection from its service.

Each season pass also has a free and premium track, so you have fresh goals to aim for and cosmetics to unlock whether you pay, or not. And if you start off free, you can always upgrade later to instantly get all premium rewards up to that point.


Season 1 will begin in June, with a second to follow in autumn, a third in winter and a fourth in spring 2024. Each will host 100 levels.

Kubernetes v1.27, released in April 2023, introduced changes to
Memory QoS (alpha) to improve memory management capabilites in Linux nodes.
Support for Memory QoS was initially added in Kubernetes v1.22, and later some
limitations
around the formula for calculating memory.high were identified. These limitations are
addressed in Kubernetes v1.27.
Background
Kubernetes allows you to optionally specify how much of each resources a container needs
in the Pod specification. The most common resources to specify are CPU and Memory.
For example, a Pod manifest that defines container resource requirements could look like:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: example
spec:
containers:
- name: nginx
resources:
requests:
memory: "64Mi"
cpu: "250m"
limits:
memory: "6…]]></summary>

Sea of Thieves' first Mystery, which ran from May to September last year, was a lovely idea in principle, weaving a web of devious clues - both in and out of the game - that would eventually reveal the culprit behind the murder of prominent character DeMarco Singh.


It certainly had its moments - the magical in-game lantern given to players at the start of the Mystery, revealing clues wherever its light shone in the world, was a lovely bit of clue-hunting paraphernalia - but, unfortunately, the whole thing just ended up lurching awkwardly to its less-than-stellar conclusion, hindered by a clumsy, immersion-shattering insistence on gating progress behind social media engagement targets.

IronOak's follow-up - which pits players against the kingdom of Fahrul's tyrannical queen 20 years after the end of the first game - is, from what's been shown so far, less a bold new direction for the series and more a deepening of the original's already hugely entertaining core.


That means another light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure blending familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - with some neat story generation through randomised narrative events.
