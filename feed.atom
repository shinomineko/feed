<blockquote><p>Smart Device Manufacturer Liability and Redress for Third-Party Cyberattack Victims</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Smart devices are used to facilitate cyberattacks against both their users and third parties. While users are generally able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and yet un-remediated bug in the smart device&#8217;s code, this lacuna is unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway, which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer of the smart device is proposed...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has rolled back a recent update to 11-year-old game Resident Evil Revelations which added a DRM called Enigma Protector.
The DRM was noticed after Steam players began reporting errors when launching Revelations last week, including a reduced and unstable framerate, as well as broken mods.
Steam users review bombed Revelations with complaints about Enigma, which prompted Capcom to roll back the game on 9th January (which can be seen on its history via SteamDB).

The upcoming 2.5D Metroidvania game features the regular human-voiced cast you'd expect, bar one character: a tree spirit named Kalux. Kalux only has a small handful of lines throughout the game, but these have been left with work-in-progress generated dialogue.


Ubisoft has said it plans to add human-recorded dialogue at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that feels a little like being catapulted back in time several decades, Ubisoft has released a free playable Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown demo - for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC - ahead of the game's full launch next week.


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown revives Ubisoft's shamefully long-dormant action-platforming series for a new generation - a new generation that wouldn't even have been born when the last game came out in 2008, thanks to Ubisoft's dallying - this time sending the prince's protector Sargon on a Metroidvania-style quest packed with side-scrolling combat and platform action.


Early word on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - which has been developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the wonderful Rayman Legends and Origins - is reassuringly positive, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman calling it a "supremely polished, ultra smooth game that perfectly leverages every platform it has shipped on."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well here's one way of getting yourself some free publicity: casually announce your product will be releasing alongside Switch 2 this "September" so everyone excitedly thinks you might have just accidentally splurged Nintendo's big secret, then, when you're confronted about it, give a little shrug and admit you were just "guessing".


That's pretty much what happened today when audio company Altec Lansing shared a press release unveiling a partnership with GameShark (now AI Shark) that'll see it release a new AI-powered GameShark successor - an announcement casually tossing in the sentence, "The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024."


Unsurprisingly, Nintendo fans desperate for Switch 2 news following persistent reports the console is launching this year (hello, I am one of these people) immediately began to wonder if Altec Lansing - not a small company by any stretch of the imagination - might have just inadvertently shared some highly confidential information they shouldn't have.

As reported by The Verge, employees at Discord were informed of the job cuts today by CEO Jason Citron in an all-hands meeting and accompanying internal email.


"Today we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to reduce the size of Discord's workforce by 17%," Citron wrote in the email shared by The Verge. "This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one that we have conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our mission over the long term."

However, creator Poncle isn't done yet, and it's now share a revised development roadmap (of sorts) for its perennially vampire-free minimalist survival RPG, which includes an update on cross-saves and a potential online co-op mode.


All this comes in a new goodbye 2023/hello 2024 post shared over on Steam, which begins with a recap of the year just gone and a thanks to players before moving onto matters in Vampires Survivors' near and not-so-near future.


That includes a word on the progress of online co-op support for the game, which Poncle confirmed it was "investigating" back in September last year. A little over three months on and the studio says it's "still investigating" the feature, explaining that to "retro-fit online multiplayer in a game as simple as this, but with so much content, is still a huge challenge."

Created by Retro Games Ltd - the company previously responsible for the C64 Mini and Amiga 500 Mini - the 400 Mini sports a similar design to Atari's 1979 8-bit computer (albeit approximately half the size) but can do a little more beyond its inspiration.


As per Retro Games' announcement, the 400 Mini (styled THE400 Mini) doesn't just emulate the Atari 400 hardware, it's also emulates the entire 8-bit Atari range, including the 400's pricier sibling the Atari 800, plus the XL and XE series, and the 5200 home console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember last year, when The Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla first suggested a new version of Part 2 was on the horizon? He said players would be able to make his in-game character "play certain themes" during the then-unannounced remastered's release. 


Now, we have a closer look at just what Santaolalla was talking about, thanks to a new marketing beat for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.


Santaolalla's cameo will actually be part of the game's Guitar Free Play mode. Although, rather than playing the guitar as we have seen Joel doing in promo shots for the upcoming release, he will play the banjo.

This release will be a souped up version of IOI's 2006 title Hitman: Blood Money. It promises a host of improvements across 12 "highly-replayable" missions, including new features such as Instinct Mode, an ever-present minimap, and an array of gameplay improvements inspired by later games in IOI's Hitman series. Of course, outfit changes and using as many different weapons and/or methods as you can is fully encouraged.


Here is a little trailer for it all, showing off some shenanigans across the globe. While I have no interest in becoming an assassin myself, I am rather jealous of Agent 47's travel opportunities.

New Cycle is described as dieselpunk by Core Engage, as the player is tasked with rebuilding society following a "global catastrophe" caused by solar flares. Settlements begin as very basic and players must progress into industrialisation, then capitalism, all whilst tackling the challenges thrown at them by the environment.
The gameplay overview takes us through each of these stages briefly, showing the transformation from a small hunter-gatherer settlement, to a larger industrial town with electricity and factories, before expanding and building a railway to enable trade and tourism.

Pokémon Go Tour: Sinnoh will debut Origin Forme Dialga and Palkia from 2022's Pokémon Legends Arceus - ancient versions of the Legendary creatures from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (the appearance of which is not a surprise, as they were first revealed a little earlier than planned last year). 


Befitting their powerful status and space-time warping properties, the pair will debut a new feature for Pokémon Go named Adventure Effects. These are gameplay-changing abilities unlocked by interacting with the creature itself that can also be boosted further using in-game resources.

The game was announced in September as an 'updated' version of the original Game Boy Advance title. At the time, Nintendo didn't say much else about the re-release, but did say multiplayer will be added.
The new trailer reveals multiplayer will come in the form of local co-op, and it looks like a second player will get to control Toad. Take a look at what's in store for Mario in the trailer below.

Season of Blood - the game's current season - is set to come to a close soon, with the next season then starting up on 23rd January. So, in just under two weeks.


While Blizzard itself has not 'announced' this date at the time of writing, a message has been spotted in Diablo 4 itself proclaiming it to be so. As you can see in the image below, when players boot up the game, they are met with a notice on the character selection screen that reads: "Season 3. Next season begins January 23, 2024".

The odd-looking and robotic-sounding Mario was the work of Proto Hologram, a company that creates holograms held within large box-like structures that you can talk to and interact with. 


More bizarre still, the Mario hologram was supposed to be a collaboration with the AARP, an American advocacy group for people over the age of 50 - apparently to demonstrate how AI holograms could combat loneliness in the elderly. But with Mario? And more to the point - with a poorly-voiced, dead-eyed broken 3D model of Mario?

That's according to Nikkei Asia (thanks VGC), which reports shares of Nintendo temporarily hit a record 7,902 today on Japan's Nikkei stock index - up 5% from yesterday - pushing its market capitalisation over 10 trillion yen ($69bn) for the first time since November 2007.


The publication notes the reason behind the recent surge in Nintendo's share price is two-fold. Firstly, growth expectations for the company are high in general, thanks to the success of its intellectual property related business, which recently announced a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, alongside the expected launch of Switch 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to May last year and you might remember EA canvassing The Sims 4 players to see if they'd prefer to see the game receive a Medieval Castle or High Tech Futurism themed building pack at some nebulous future point. Well, Medieval Castle (wrongly) won the vote, and some eight months later it looks like the DLC is ready for an imminent release.


That's according to a presumably premature reveal on the EA App (thanks SimsCommunity), which provides full details and screenshots of the The Sims 4 Castle Estate Kit, as the new DLC is officially known. It also offers up a release date of 15th October, 2099 - which is almost definitely a placeholder, unless EA really is in it for the long haul where The Sims 4 is concerned.


Weird date aside, everything else in the listing looks accurate. Alongside two screenshots featuring the new DLC pack's various building bits in action, we get some blurb explaining the Castle Estate Kit will enable The Sims 4 players to "capture the classic grandeur of a castle".

"While we have been heads down adding cars, tracks, patches, and other improvements," the studio wrote in the first of a series of planned quarterly development updates on its website, "we want to acknowledge the top three areas of feedback we haven't addressed directly".


Those areas, specifically, are driver AI, car progression, and race regulations, and it sounds like fixing AI issues - which, as per Turn 10's update, include "abruptly braking and slowing down; not accelerating out of exits, braking too hard on mild corners, and following racing lines too strictly" - is first on its to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mojang and developer Blackbird Interactive have officially brought development on Minecraft Legends to a end today with one final content update, wrapping up a little under nine months of post-launch support for the real-time strategy spin-off.


Releasing in May last year, Minecraft Legends unfortunately didn't especially impress, proving to be a decidedly average RTS that failed to do much to justify its use of the Minecraft licence. "It feels too overwhelming and poorly explained for kids," Eurogamer contributor Caelyn Ellis wrote in her review, "too rudimentary for older players and too frustrating for both. Minecraft is, at least for me, about creativity and experimentation, but there's no room for that here."


Still, Mojang and Blackbird Interactive have continued to support Minecraft Legends with a series of post-launch content updates since its arrival, but Mojang has now confirmed today's Snow vs. Snouts update - initially announced during last year's Minecraft Live event and originally planned to launch in December - will be its last.

From 16th January, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands will be available for both PS4 and PS5 (the PS4 version is also streamable), giving PlayStation Plus subscribers the chance to sample Gearbox's well-received tabletop RPG spin on its raucous shooter series. As for Capcom's Resident Evil 2 remake, also available for both PS4 and PS5, it gives the 1998 classic a thorough modernising with splashy new presentation and ample mechanical tweaks, and the results are sublime.


Elsewhere, there's an opportunity to revisit the PS4 version of the utterly wonderful LEGO City Undercover, developer TT Fusion's wildy imaginative and genuinely hilarious open-world take on the familiar Lego game formula, which plays out very much like a family friendly GTA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada has asked Native American fans of the series for their thoughts on the designs of fighters Michelle and Julia, and what advice they'd give to him if he created a new Native American character for the series.
Michelle, a woman of Chinese and Native American descent, appeared in the first Tekken game. Michelle was included in the next games until Tekken 3, which introduced her adoptive daughter Julia. Since then, Julia has appeared in the main series instead, with both making appearances in various Tekken spin-offs. 
Since their first appearances, Michelle and Julia have frequently been brought up in discussions of Indigenous representation in video games. Harada took to X (née Twitter) last week to acknowledge the characters' importance within the topic, explain the history of their designs, and ask for the opinions of Native American Tekken fans.

It is a fairly standard marketing beat, with others such as Insomniac and Nintendo doing the same thing for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom respectively. But what Insomniac and Nintendo didn't have (or who they didn't have) was Succession's Brian Cox to talk us through the story so far. 


Yes, the man that brought Logan Roy to life is here to tell us all about the Devil gene and more. "Every single fight, no matter how big or small, has a story behind it," the Scottish actor states as dramatic music starts to pound in the background. "There's one hell of a story to tell."


We then get told more about that aforementioned Devil gene, some cliff chucking exploits and the Tekken series' patricidal puzzle. You can have a watch for yourself below. I don't think it is meant to be funny, but it has made me chuckle.

The faceplates, shown in the header image above and below (thanks, The Verge), are from the Deep Earth Collection and consist of Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue and Sterling Silver. This collection, you may recall, was also announced for the original PS5 model back in September last year. 

"While crafting this new collection of DualSense controller and PS5 console cover colours, we drew inspiration from the beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth. We elevated the colours by adding a metallic finish for a touch of sophistication," designer Satoshi Aoyagi said at the time.

The news was shared in a new blog post from CEO Dan Clancy, including a copy of the internal email sent to staff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a day after Unity announced it would be laying off 1,800 employees as part of an ongoing "company reset", it's being reported that live-streaming site Twitch is now poised to cut 35 percent of its workforce - equalling around 500 jobs - later this week.


That's according to Bloomberg's Cecilia D'Anastasio, who, citing "people familiar with the plans", reports the cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday.


While Twitch declined to comment on the story when approached by Bloomberg, the publication claims the job cuts come amid continuing struggles for the live-streaming site. According to Bloomberg's sources, Twitch still remains unprofitable nine years after Amazon acquired the company for $970m.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld, the open-world survival and crafting adventure from developer Pocketpair that looks a lot like Pokémon with guns, is launching into early access on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass next Friday, 19th January.


Pocketpair describes Palworld as a "monster-catching, survival and crafting game" over on its Steam page, but notes it also features "a variety of mechanics from other genres in order to provide a completely new experience for everyone." And while harmonious living alongside the Pals you catch (initially totalling over 100) is certainly possible - with the likes of idyllic farming, land and sea exploration, dungeon crawling, battling, building, and breeding all featured - it also looks to have a darker side too, and not just because of those guns.


Players that choose to take on the game's ruthless poaching syndicate might, for example, find themselves traversing perilous climes where limited resources could mean they're forced to eat their Pals. Meanwhile, Pals can be put to work making fire, generating electricity, or mining ore, or sent to a factory line where they can be made to automate different tasks - until they drop dead, that is. Then, there's poaching, with players able to do crime, sneaking into wildlife sanctuaries to capture rare Pals that can be sold for cash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrowhead Game Studios has shared more information on the PC version of its satirical sci-fi shooter sequel Helldivers 2 ahead of its PlayStation 5 and PC launch on 8th February, alongside confirmation of crossplay support between platforms.


Helldivers 2 follows the same basic template as its well-received predecessor (which earned a Eurogamer Recommended badge back in 2015), sending players - either working solo or in teams of up to four - on procedurally generated missions across hostile alien worlds to complete objectives, subjugate the locals, and orchestrate their escape. The likes of customisable loadouts and stratagems return in the sequel, but the major difference is a shift from a top-down perspective to third-person one this time around.


And now, Arrowhead has confirmed players across PlayStation 5 and PC will be able to experience all the above together, courtesy of Helldivers 2's crossplay support. "Community and teamwork are the most important pillars of Helldivers 2," it explained, "and so it is essential to ensure players can work together regardless of the system they choose to use. Together we can celebrate victories, mourn losses, and liberate the galaxy without platform boundaries."

Xbox fans rejoiced when Baldur's Gate 3 surprised-launched at the end of last year following an extended delay related to split-screen co-op, but things got off to a bumpy start, with some players soon reporting their saves were being lost after crashing - a frankly horrifying prospect for a title as lengthy and involved as Baldur's Gate 3.


Unfortunately, the issue has continued to persist in the weeks since; Larian recently offered a workaround to help players avoid the save issue, but noted that a permanent fix would require a firmware update from Microsoft, which was still in the works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cult of the Lamb players asked, and the developer listened. The evil sheep-fronted management game is getting a 'sex' update.


This free update is known as Sins of the Flesh, and is coming (no pun intended, but, hey, as it is there anyway let's just roll with it) to platforms on 16th January.


Developer Massive Monster calls the upcoming content its "biggest and most wicked" update yet. It will include new progression systems, which will add more complexity to the gameplay. The Cult of the Lamb team also boasts about the arrival of "shiny poop, baneful brooms, and bigger, better buildings," so plenty to keep an eye out for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cult of the Lamb players asked, and the developer listened. The evil sheep-fronted management game is getting a 'sex' update.


This free update is known as Sins of the Flesh, and is coming (no pun intended, but, hey, as it is there anyway let's just roll with it) to platforms on 16th January.


Developer Massive Monster calls the upcoming content its "biggest and most wicked" update yet. It will include new progression systems, which will add more complexity to the gameplay. The Cult of the Lamb team also boasts about the arrival of "shiny poop, baneful brooms, and bigger, better buildings," so plenty to keep an eye out for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 10/01/24: The Apex Legends crossover event with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is live, meaning the cost of event packs is now confirmed.
As per the official Instagram video shared previously, the cost of event packs is 100 coins - reduced from the standard 1000 coins. 
However, the cost of packs actually increases depending on the number of items owned, as per the screenshot below. If players own 16 to 35 items, the cost of packs increases back to 1000 coins. It means if players want to own all 36 items (including the death box), it won't cost the full £360 but they'll still need to shell out a considerable amount.

The event begins later today in celebration of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth arriving next month, and includes a number of themed items, skins, and events. 


This is the first in-game crossover of its kind in Apex Legends and the potential cost of items is eye-watering for fans. On social media, the high cost has sparked fury in the game's community, although this is based on the current cost of packs that could be reduced once the event launches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At its recent CES 2024 press conference, Sony took the chance to show off the company's future tech possibilities by driving a car onto the stage. Admittedly, that in itself isn't all that remarkable, but what makes this little stunt more interesting is that the car was being controlled by a PlayStation DualSense controller.


During a segment hosted by Honda's president Toshihiro Mibe talking about the car manufacturer's work with Sony, the exec spoke about "the joy of expanding life's potential". 
Its vision expands beyond just your regular cars and motorcycles, with talk of the sky, ocean and outer space being shared. Sony's technologies will help Honda expand its "field of mobility", the company president explained. Then, the president and COO of Sony Honda Mobility Inc Izumi Kawanishi joined his colleague on the stage, and this is where we head into video game territory.

Around five seconds of footage, including a behind-the-scenes motion capture shot, can be glimpsed in the video below - it shows a blonde-haired character leaping from a rooftop, then soaring down through the buildings of a floating city.


At the end of the clip, the character then flies towards what looks like a red, dragon-like beastie. All of this takes place in rather realistic-like surroundings - a far cry from the anime-inspired visuals of the original games. Intriguing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has announced a further round of layoffs, less than two months after its previous job cuts, that'll see it eliminate roughly 25 percent of its total workforce - around 1,800 employees - as part of the "company reset" it unveiled at the end of last year.


Unity confirmed additional layoffs at the company were "likely" back in November, when it revealed it was assessing its portfolio "to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers". Shortly after, it announced it was ending its agreement with Weta FX, resulting in the loss of 265 jobs - the company's fourth round of layoffs since the start of 2022.


A fresh round of layoffs at Unity - the largest ever at the company - has now been confirmed in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. This time, around 1,800 employees will be affected, with the company saying the cuts come as it "restructures and refocuses on its core business" and seeks to "position itself for long-term and profitable growth."

Word Baldur's Gate 3 players were receiving bans for using an Xbox-approved feature with an Xbox-approved game (albeit in a way potentially violating Microsoft policy) surfaced last week, and developer Larian quickly moved to assure fans it was working with Microsoft to sort out the "annoying and uncool" suspensions. Shortly after it said affected parties should start seeing their bans lifted, and that "Work is ongoing, and the Microsoft team is aware of the issue!".


A week on and Microsoft itself has now acknowledged the situation in a statement on social media. "To provide clarity on Baldur's Gate 3 mature content enforcement actions," it wrote, "Xbox account suspensions are not automatic. Each clip is reviewed by a moderator and, if found in violation of our safety and content policies, actioned accordingly."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following speculation Microsoft may be considering bringing its acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush to Switch, new reports have claimed the company has also been looking into a PlayStation and Switch release for developer Rare's acclaimed multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves.


Journalist and prolific leaker Jeff Grubb initially claimed Microsoft had been eyeing up a potential PlayStation and Switch release for Sea of Thieves on his Game Mess podcast earlier today. That was followed by a similar story from former Axios journalist Stephen Totilo, writing on his newly launched Game File website.


Totilo offered a slightly different spin on Grubb's report, saying he'd heard Microsoft had considered releasing Sea of Thieves on PlayStation, but that his "source familiar with plans for the port" had made no mention of Switch.

Vincke confirmed the studio's next game was in the works last November, saying he "very excited about it", and that Baldur's Gate 3's critical and commercial success was "really encouraging us to ensure it pushes many boundaries".


And now, in a series of tweets, Vincke has shared a bit of a progress update, saying, "Been a great morning! After four months of rewriting and rewriting and abandoning ideas and then revisiting them, finally figured out what act one on this thing I've been working on needs to be.

As with <a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022/">IWORD 2022</a>, the goal was to bring together a diverse set of thinkers and practitioners to talk about how democracy might be reimagined for the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>My thinking is very broad here. Modern democracy was invented in the mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies, it would look very different. Representation would look different. Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation would look different. Everything would look different, because we would have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to worry about...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 9/1/24: Magic: The Gathering maker Wizards of the Coast has issued a statement saying it will work with external vendors to ensure AI-generated artwork is kept out of promotional material for the game. 
The statement follows the recent departure of an artist at the company, who said he had quit in protest at the promotional material.
"Thanks to our diligent community who pointed out a series of recent marketing images may have included elements of generative AI, we are rethinking our process of how we work with vendors for our marketing creative," Wizards of the Coast wrote in a new statement.

Although Wizards of the Coast refuted accusations that a recent image was generated via AI, fans and artists alike were quick to point out inconsistencies with the image.
The charge is particularly emotive given Wizards of the Coast confirmed last month that it "require[s] artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the Magic TCG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final Magic products".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A remake of the original Metal Gear Solid game is reportedly still in development at Konami.
According to the Spanish website Areajugones – which previously, and correctly, leaked God of War Regnarök's DLC existence ahead of a formal announcement – "Konami is still working on a remake of the first installment, although right now Metal Gear Solid Delta is a priority in the studio".
The website reports that the claim comes from "multiple sources" and suggests that it will only be playable on PS5, not PS4. Similarly, there's been no mention of a PC or Xbox release, either. Given Metal Gear Solid Delta is coming to multiple platforms, though, it stands to reason that the Metal Gear Solid Remake will, too. But all we can do is wait for official confirmation.

Unfortunately there's still no release date for the expansion beyond 'summer 2024'.

The filing – lodged by a 57-year-old white man who worked at the company from 2014 until he was laid off as part of the company's restructure in late 2023 – says that shortly after hearing these comments, a pair of white executives left "based, at least in part, on Kotick's ageist remarks", adding that "Activision placed profits over people by terminating the older, higher-paid executives".

To fully appreciate this tribute, we need to go back a few years. When Baldur's Gate 3 was still in early access, forum user Solfalia messaged Larian to thank the studio for releasing Act I, despite the game not being complete. This release allowed Solfalia to play the game - as it was at the time - with their father, who had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Their father had played other Larian games in the past and was a fan, so this opportunity meant a lot to them both.


"This Early Access means that this Xmas I'll be able to go on an adventure with him one last time, and I know he'll enjoy it," Solfalia wrote in their original post from 2020.

But while The Lost Crown can be challenging, the team doesn't want this to put players off, and so has included a variety of accessibility options as standard. This includes larger text by default, no quick time events and "no colour-based feedback". In addition, there will be options that will allow players to customise the gameplay difficulty to a style that's best for them.

Developer Larian shared an update on X (formerly Twitter) over the weekend, to state work is ongoing to sort these bans. The bans in question saw players being penalised for capturing in-game footage containing nudity, which was then uploaded to Xbox servers.
"Microsoft team is aware of the issue," the developer said. "If you're wanting to upload any clips in the meantime, make sure to turn off mature content."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Larian is working alongside Microsoft to sort out "annoying and uncool" account bans, which can happen when Baldur's Gate 3 footage containing nudity gets uploaded to Xbox servers. 


This all stems back to the weekend, when Reddit user Daddy-Vegas warned other Baldur's Gate 3 players about capturing certain footage in Larian's award-winning RPG. The Redditor recorded "some naked camp time fun", which they planned to share with their brother. Xbox then automatically uploaded the footage to its servers. 


However, if Xbox discovers imagery it deems offensive, the content is removed and the player's profile will be "temporarily prohibited from sharing additional imagery (typically for 24 hours)". And, as Daddy-Vegas' clips included that aforementioned nudity, they were met with a ban for each clip, which resulted in their account being suspended for a year. They have since appealed their ban, with the Redditor revealing earlier this week their efforts were successful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser has denied being involved in a new flash cart project claimed to allow Switch users to play back-ups of their owned games.
The MIG-Switch flash cart, officially, is a "third party back-up and development device for the Nintendo Switch" according to the device website, that's not endorsed nor licenced by Nintendo of Japan. While the idea behind the device is players can back up games they own legally, it also opens the door for piracy and for people to potentially play roms of games they do not own.
However, Bowser - who was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices back in 2022 - said he was "not involved" in any aspect of the MIG-Switch. Rather, the hacker reportedly said he had been the "subject of DNS poisoning attack on [his] nameservers" (thanks, VGC).

In a world first, 13-year-old Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson - who is a competitive Tetris player - has managed to get the decades old falling block game to reveal its "kill screen". While not your traditional end of game, with credits or even game over message, this screen essentially sees Tetris crash. This is beating Tetris, a once thought impossible feat. 


The delight shown by the young player, who was born over two decades after the game actually released, as the screen freezes is palpable. "Oh my god," Gibson repeats. "I'm going to pass out, I can't feel my fingers."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrainian studio Frogwares is now the sole publisher of Lovecraft-inspired detective adventure The Sinking City. This follows the conclusion of a legal dispute with publisher Nacon, in which Frogwares accused the company of claiming copyright of The Sinking City after its release, withholding milestone payments, and owing the developer unpaid royalties.


The dispute between the two companies saw Frogwares attempting to remove The Sinking City from PC storefront Steam in a bid to sever its ties to Nacon. In February 2021, Frogwares then told people not to buy its game from Steam and the following month it issued The Sinking City with a DMCA takedown. At this time, it claimed Nacon had "illegally" uploaded a hacked version to Valve's platform.


Now, Frogwares is the sole publisher of The Sinking City across all platforms. In a post appropriately shared on Steam, the studio said it was "happy to put this whole thing behind" it, and is now looking forward to "sharing more news about the future of the franchise down the line".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's upcoming open world Star Wars game Outlaws looks to be set for a "late" 2024 release. 


Until today, the Ubisoft game held a much wider ranging 2024 release window. However, a Disney Parks blog post promoting a variety of events and such for the next 12 months has Star Wars Outlaws listed as arriving towards the tail end of the year. 


"Star Wars Outlaws, the open world Star Wars game, is set to release late this year," the post reads (thanks, IGN). "The game lets you explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. You can risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. If you're willing to take the risk, the galaxy is full of opportunity."

"The game is now essentially confirmed to be in development, as an NCSoft employee posted a job listing on LinkedIn with a codename logo stylised similarly to the logo of Horizon games," Kurakasis said. "It's developed under the codename Project Skyline, with the initial codename being Project H."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A slide allegedly taken from a Sony presentation has revealed how many units some of the company's biggest first-party games have sold. 

The slide – which notably excludes other Sony first-party titles, including Naughty Dog's The Last of Us series and Horizon Zero Dawn's sequel, Horizon Forbidden West – reveals the sale figures for several games released since 2017, including Marvel's Spider-Man (2018), God of War (2018), and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020), which have sold 18.9 million, 15.9 million, and 12.6 million copies in their first two years, respectively. 

The same table, if true, also reveals that Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) sold 11 million copies, Gran Turismo Sport (2017) 7.8 million, Days Gone (2019) 7 million, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (2021) 3.9 million, and "Ghost Dir Cut" – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut (2021) – 3.3 million copies.

<blockquote><p>To test PIGEON&#8217;s performance, I gave it five personal photos from a trip I took across America years ago, none of which have been published online. Some photos were snapped in cities, but a few were taken in places nowhere near roads or other easily recognizable landmarks.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t seem to matter much.</p>
<p>It guessed a campsite in Yellowstone to within around 35 miles of the actual location. The program placed another photo, taken on a street in San Francisco, to within a few city blocks.</p>
<p>Not every photo was an easy match: The program mistakenly linked one photo taken on the front range of Wyoming to a spot along the front range of Colorado, more than a hundred miles away. And it guessed that a picture of the Snake River Canyon in Idaho was of the Kawarau Gorge in New Zealand (in fairness, the two landscapes look remarkably similar)...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>When Stolen Device Protection is turned on, Face ID or Touch ID authentication is required for additional actions, including viewing passwords or passkeys stored in iCloud Keychain, applying for a new Apple Card, turning off Lost Mode, erasing all content and settings, using payment methods saved in Safari, and more. No passcode fallback is available in the event that the user is unable to complete Face ID or Touch ID authentication.</p>
<p>For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple said there will be no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

News of the limits wiped a combined ~$80bn from the value of Tencent and NetEase, China's two main games publishers that now support or part-own many of the world's biggest games companies.


Chinese online video games will now no longer be able to offer an extra incentive to spend in a game for the first time, or for spending repeatedly, Reuters reported.

Arion Kurtaj, now 18, was part of the Lapsus$ hacking group behind similar attacks on Nvidia, Uber and BT, among others.


Kurtaj hacked Rockstar in September 2022, while already on bail for hacking charges and staying under police protection at a Travelodge, BBC News reported.

It's remarkable to see an in-development game being played in this way - and I can't think of a similar situation, at least in recent memory. The GTA 6 hack contained a mountain of development assets, yes, but nothing playable in this manner. 


Here, people have been able to access a test build of Wolverine akin to an internal demo meant for Insomniac and Sony, that features multiple sections of the game available to play and explore. Naturally, these sections are still incomplete and unpolished, but key gameplay mechanics and story moments are included.

Known as Tastes of the Seven Tribes, this book will allow you to whip up a batch of spicy Fireclaw stew or even some Bitterbrew Boar (which is described as "mouth-watering"). 


It's coming from Insight Editions, Rick Barba and prolific recipe writer Victoria Rosenthal, whose name you may recognise from a myriad of other video game related cookery books such as God of War's Official Cookbook of the Nine Realms and the Donlan-approved Destiny cookbook.

The subtle changes were noticed two days ago on 19th December, when Epic announced two games, Gods Unchained and Striker Manager 3, have been relisted on its storefront. Both games were removed from the store after they received an Adults Only rating from the ESRB in the USA.
Previously, Epic banned all games with an Adults Only rating from its store but has openly welcomed blockchain games. In order to allow Gods Unchained and Striker Manager 3 back onto its store, Epic has tweaked its policies on prohibited content.

On 11th December, one user posted training material for the Norinco VT-4 tank (as reported by Cyber Daily). On 12th December, a user posted a manual for the M2A2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle (as reported by Task and Purpose).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Controversial Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick will depart the company on 29th December, it's been announced. 


Kotick's reign lasted 32 years, during which time the company became one of the biggest and most influential video games publishers on the planet. 


His departure this month is not unexpected - Activision Blizzard had previously confirmed Kotick's presence only until the end of this year to "ensure a smooth and seamless integration" following  Microsoft's long-winded but ultimately successful $68.7bn acquisition. Now, we know exactly when Kotick leaves and how the company will be shaped without him.

On behalf of the Structured Logging Working Group
and SIG Instrumentation,
we are pleased to announce that the contextual logging feature
introduced in Kubernetes v1.24 has now been successfully migrated to
two components (kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager)
as well as some directories. This feature aims to provide more useful logs
for better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers to enhance Kubernetes.
What is contextual logging?
Contextual logging
is based on the go-logr API.
The key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller
and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger.
The binary decides the logging implementation, not the libraries.

The game is currently codenamed R and is planned for an official reveal in 2025, according to Bloober's press release about the partnership (in Polish).

Skybound is most known for the comic series The Walking Dead, which was created by Skybound co-founder Robert Kirkman in 2010. Skybound established its subsidiary Skybound Games in 2018 to publish and license video games.

Sony announced the milestone today, and said PS5 had passed the 50m mark earlier this month, on 9th December. 


That means PS5 took 160 weeks and 2 days to reach the 50m milestone - just one week longer than PS4, despite severe sales constraints for much of its early lifecycle.

This page has raised some eyebrows, however, as the game is listed there as "The Suika Game" and not "Suika Game". The game's original developer is also not mentioned.


The original Suika Game was developed by Aladdin X and, so far, it has only been released on the Nintendo eShop, though many browser versions and clones on other platforms have since popped up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioWare and Mass Effect veteran Mac Walters has discussed his reasons for departing the studio after 19 years to begin work with a fresh team on a new sci-fi franchise.


In an interview with MinnMax, Walters detailed the various factors involved in his departure, from the desire to work on something brand new and not feeling able to within BioWare or EA, to the positive experience of working on the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition trilogy remaster with a small and "scrappy" team acting as a reminder of his early days at the studio and serving as a positive moment to make his exit.


Discussing the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition project, Walters described its approval by EA as something relatively "unplanned", compared to the careful assignment of teams long in advance to work on the studio's typical fare: mammoth big budget RPGs. This led to a different way of working which brought back fond memories, he said.

Frostbite was originally developed by DICE for use in its Battlefield series, and has since been adopted internally at other studios also owned by its parent company EA.
Historically, the engine was used by BioWare to develop Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem to mixed reception on technical performance. Recently, it was used in this year's Dead Space remake and EA's numerous annual sports franchises.

The multiplayer shooter shadow-dropped during The Game Awards at the beginning of the month and has proved popular. Unfortunately, popularity has brought in large numbers of cheater being discussed on the game's subreddit and official Discord server.
Community lead Dusty Gustaffson shared an update with players on Discord yesterday, revealing Embark has "had a technical issue that prevented us from banning cheaters efficiently", but is now in the process of "re-upping" anti-cheat measures as it implements a solution to the bug.

This blog discusses a new feature in Kubernetes 1.29 to improve the handling of taint-based pod eviction.
Background
In Kubernetes 1.29, an improvement has been introduced to enhance the taint-based pod eviction handling on nodes.
This blog discusses the changes made to node-lifecycle-controller
to separate its responsibilities and improve overall code maintainability.
Summary of changes
node-lifecycle-controller previously combined two independent functions:
Adding a pre-defined set of NoExecute taints to Node based on Node's condition.
Performing pod eviction on NoExecute taint.
With the Kubernetes 1.29 release, the taint-based eviction implementation has been
moved out of node-lifecycle-controller into a separate and independent compone…]]></summary>

With the recent release of Kubernetes 1.29, the PodReadyToStartContainers
condition is
available by default.
The kubelet manages the value for that condition throughout a Pod's lifecycle,
in the status field of a Pod. The kubelet will use the PodReadyToStartContainers
condition to accurately surface the initialization state of a Pod,
from the perspective of Pod sandbox creation and network configuration by a container runtime.
What's the motivation for this feature?
Cluster administrators did not have a clear and easily accessible way to view the completion of Pod's sandbox creation
and initialization. As of 1.28, the Initialized condition in Pods tracks the execution of init containers.
However, it has limitations in accurately re…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leaks for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League have moved on from a steady drip to become a flood. 


As I said earlier today, developer Rocksteady has been battling leaks for its upcoming game since its alpha test took place in November. 


However, the ferocity of these leaks has now increased ten-fold, and so this is another warning to mute social media and such if you want to keep the game as much a surprise as possible.

The leak has been dubbed the "teraleak" due to its sheer size and seemingly as a nod to the Nintendo "gigaleak" from 2020 which included prototypes of Star Fox 2 and Yoshi's Island, cut content from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, and more.
TestFlight is a service for developers to release iOS apps for testing. Files on Apple's servers were found archived via Wayback Machine and then shared anonymously to X (née Twitter). Links to the archives can be found quite easily by entering "TestFlight leak" into your chosen search engine.

The patent features algorithms that would be able to finely tune difficulty settings based on an individual's performance. It is interesting to see Sony patent such an idea, when similar processes are used in other games already. 


Regardless, this patent (which can be viewed via World Intellectual Property Organization), shows PlayStation has its eye on the future of this sort of technology.

The move follows the ongoing investigations into The Open Hand Foundation, a fundraising body created by Khalil's family.
Sabotage and Khalil had a close working relationship, with Khalil consistently giving the studio a spot in IndieLand, an annual charity stream to support The Open Hand Foundation, and supporting Sea of Stars on Kickstarter. Sabotage created specific content for use in IndieLand, and eventually added Khalil as an NPC called Jirard the Constructionist in the release version of Sea of Stars. 
But now there are allegations Khalil committed charity fraud through The Open Hand Foundation, via YouTubers Mutahar "SomeOrdinaryGamers" Anas and Karl Jobst. Following further investigations, and responses from Khalil, Anas, and Jobst, Sabotage has now replaced Jirard the Constructionist in a new Sea of Stars patch.

"Originally it was a Fortnite clone. Nobody wanted that really, not even us, but we didn't have much of a choice for a long time," the developer told fan wiki The Free Radical Archive.

This blog introduces a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.29.
It provides a configurable approach to define how Service implementations,
exemplified in this blog by kube-proxy,
handle traffic from pods to the Service, within the cluster.
Background
In older Kubernetes releases, the kube-proxy would intercept traffic that was destined for the IP
address associated with a Service of type: LoadBalancer. This happened whatever mode you used
for kube-proxy.
The interception implemented the expected behavior (traffic eventually reaching the expected
endpoints behind the Service). The mechanism to make that work depended on the mode for kube-proxy;
on Linux, kube-proxy in iptables mode would redirecting packets directly to the endpoint; in ipvs mode,
kube-proxy would configure t…]]></summary>

With the release of Kubernetes v1.29, the ReadWriteOncePod volume access mode
has graduated to general availability: it's part of Kubernetes' stable API. In
this blog post, I'll take a closer look at this access mode and what it does.
What is ReadWriteOncePod?
ReadWriteOncePod is an access mode for
PersistentVolumes (PVs)
and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
introduced in Kubernetes v1.22. This access mode enables you to restrict volume
access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to
the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads
that require single-writer access to storage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima says that when he parted ways with Konami, he was "opposed" by peers, colleagues, and relatives" who told him that going independent would "never work".
In a statement shared to X/Twitter overnight, Kojima also reflected on why he continues to make games, saying that one of the reasons he became an independent developer was because creating games "is living" and "no longer a job".


"The reason why I am independent and advocate a life-long career is because for me, 'creating things' is no longer a job," Kojima said in the lengthy tweet.

The team stopped short of revealing when it would withdraw the games, but did assure current owners that "existing players can continue to enjoy these games without interruption".

Chapter 1: A Tight Squeeze – which was first released on PC back in 2021 – is set to debut on PS4 and PS5 on 20th December, and on Switch on 25th December. Presumably, because there's no better time to release a terrifying horror game on a family-favourite console than Christmas Day.

You can wishlist the PlayStation-flavoured version now, or pre-order on Switch from 18th December.

Although the closure has yet to be formally announced, a LinkedIn post from an alleged former employee there reveals that the official website, kaiju.gg, now only loads a 404 page, and the studio's former LinkedIn listing now leads to a "this LinkedIn Page isn't available" error.

"Team Kaiju doesn't appear to exist anymore," the developer noted. "No announcement from Tencent. Most of the folks there were amazing. I wish them the best for the future."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is one of the year's best releases as far as I'm concerned, but its arrival was bittersweet, given developer Mimimi Games announced it was shutting up shop shortly after. Since then, the team has wrapped up work on two final DLC drops introducing new characters, islands, and more - but it turns out that wasn't quite everything it had in store: in a surprise final update, Mimimi has now launched an expansive "modding tool" for PC.


Shadow Gambit launched back in August, and saw Mimimi revisiting its beloved stealth-tactics genre - which it'd already bought to life with impressive flair in Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperatdos 3 - with an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. The result, as I wrote in my four star review was a blend of "raucous, high seas adventure and cerebral, slow-paced stealth" that proved to be a "joyous mastery of a very particular form".


Shortly after its release, Mimimi announced Shadow Gambit would be the studio's last project, as its "increasingly ambitious games" had taken a "heavy personal toll on us and our families". Two final DLC releases for Shadow Gambit were to bring the studio's activities to a close, but it's now surprised fans with a "very final parting gift": an expansive "modding tool" designed to enable players to create their own custom mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve's making a list, and checking it twice; it's gonna find out who's naughty and nice. And if you happen to be on its Naughty List - which pretty much applies to any one of the "thousands" of DOTA 2 players now identified as being dirty, filthy cheaters - you can expect a cheerfully gift-wrapped lump of toxic coal and a permanent ban in your stocking as your festive treat for 2023.


DOTA 2's annual Frostivus celebrations are now officially underway, meaning everyone on Valve's Nice List - as per its Frostivus 2023 update announcement - can look forward to various festive treats and quality of life improvements. It's less of a jolly holiday for those who've been placed on Valve's Naughty List, however: King Kringle is now doing the rounds with his ban hammer to "pulverise the smurf accounts of all the naughty boys and girls, before handing out penalties to their associated main accounts."


Following Valve's brutal culling of over 90,000 smurf accounts back in September, the company says it's "continued to invest in player behaviour monitoring" and will be handing out still punishments for smurf accounts and other "questionable choices", including "bad actors...playing like jerks, ruining games and losing behaviour score because of it, then hiring behaviour score farmers to drive it back up."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can you believe it's already been over four hundred years since Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was announced? And while this year's Game Awards failed to make the interminable wait any easier with a first trailer or some small morsel of news for fans, we might finally have something resembling a potential release window - courtesy of a retailer leak, by way of an official Bandai Namco partner, pointing to a February 2024 launch for the DLC.


As spotted over on Reddit, details of a new Elden Ring collaboration between publisher Bandai Namco and peripheral manufacturer Thrustmaster - one that'll apparently see the latter release a series of limited edition controllers themed around the game - were today shared, briefly and presumably mistakenly, by online retailer Datablitz.


Notably, the accompanying promotional material revealed the first batch of controllers would arrive in February next year to "sync with the new Shadow of the Erdtree expansion release". It's a launch window that seems highly unlikely at first glance, not least because it's barely two months from now with no peep of marketing from Bandai Namco - but on the other hand, who's to say that if I wish for something hard enough I can't make it happen? Plus, a surprise second anniversary launch would be in keeping with the amusingly understated way the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was announced in the first place.

"I decided to leave because I felt that the direction the company was heading in was different from my beliefs as a developer. Without that element of trust, I couldn't continue working there, and so I left, so that I could continue working in what I consider to be the right way."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Japanese department store Parco is holding an exhibition in collaboration with the Like a Dragon series, which is themed around some of its most notable dead characters.
The exhibition will first be held at Parco Factory, a gallery at the Parco store in Ikebukuro, Tokyo from 30th December to 15th January, 2024. It'll feature series protagonists Kiryu, Ichiban, and Majima, as well as the noble "fallen men" who they've encountered over the years. 
The exhibition will be laid out as a memorial space, with pictures of the dead characters and their last words put up onto the walls. Visitors will be given flowers to place at the portrait of their favourite dead character, before arriving at a cenotaph with an AR "gimmick" which sounds like the character will appear on your phone.

Speaking with IGN, Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke stated the award winning RPG won't appear on Microsoft's subscription service, and that has always been the plan. 


"We made a big game, so I think there's a fair price to be paid for that, and I think that that is okay," Vincke said, adding Baldur's Gate 3's inclusion on Game Pass was a "sensitive question".

Celestial featured in the credits of the base game, while Toby Fox - known as the creator of Undertale - composed music for the soundtrack, specifically the raid battle theme among others.


The remix is a stripped back, string-heavy affair that chops up the vocal lines - it's a pleasant change from the original.

The artwork gives our first glimpse of the game's vampire enemies.

It looks incredibly good, and hopefully this will carry over into the game's release. For want of a better word, it looks really, really cool, and has echoes of the studio's previous works Deathloop and Dishonored (at this point, it is worth noting that Arkane's previous vampire game Redfall was primarily helmed by its Austin department).

As noted by Digital Foundry's John Linneman, it also allowed players to zoom out and take in the entirety of Koholint Island at once.

As a sidenote, performance in The Indigo Disk is still bad, as Lewchube on X (née Twitter) discovered, and in some cases even worse than the base game.

"We again apologise for the missteps we've made," reads a new blog post from Creative Assembly vice president Roger Collum. "The mistakes of Total War are a shared responsibility by all the leaders of the franchise, and while it may not seem like it at times, we are listening."

Naughty Dog's multiplayer game was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but the studio announced it was separating the two halves in 2019. After years of relative silence on its progress, studio co-head Neil Druckmann emerged in January to confirm more would be revealed "later this year" - but instead, May brought the news the project needed "more time".


Shortly after, a report from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claimed Destiny developer Bungie - which had been individually assessing many of Sony's "games as a service" projects since being acquired by the company - had raised concerns about The Last of Us multiplayer's "ability to keep players engaged for a long period of time", resulting in Sony scaling back the team to just a "small group" while it evaluated the project's direction.

The v1.29 release of Kubernetes introduced an alpha feature to support modifying a volume

With the feature enabled, Kubernetes can handle updates of volume attributes other than capacity.
Allowing volume attributes to be changed without managing it through different

For Kubernetes v1.29, you need to use additional components to integrate your
Kubernetes cluster with a cloud infrastructure provider. By default, Kubernetes
v1.29 components abort if you try to specify integration with any cloud provider using
one of the legacy compiled-in cloud provider integrations. If you want to use a legacy
integration, you have to opt back in - and a future release will remove even that option.
In 2018, the Kubernetes community agreed to form the Cloud Provider Special
Interest Group (SIG), with a mission to externalize all cloud provider
integrations and remove all the existing in-tree cloud provider integrations.
In January 2019, the Kubernetes community approved the initial draft of

Netflix formed its own studios in Helsinki and California last year, and acquired four other studios, including Oxenfree developer Night School Studio and Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox.
Verdu said the six studios are working on over 10 games in an interview with Axios, and stated Netflix has a total of 90 games in development through deals with external teams.

The American film and TV production company is known for its surreal work, making it a good fit for Kojima (in my opinion). It also acts as a distributor for films, with titles such as the Oscar winning Everything Everywhere All At Once and the brilliant (also in my opinion) Ex Machina included in its library. 


"A24 was born into this world about 10 years ago, their presence is singular within the industry, they are like no other. The films they are delivering to the world are high in quality and very innovative," Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima said following the announcement.

After years of waiting, Rockstar gave us our first slice of GTA 6 last week with a new trailer. Soon after, the studio confirmed the game will release sometime in 2025 on both Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. At the time of writing, there is no word on a PC release window.


According to York, who worked on the likes of GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 during his time at Rockstar, a PC port of a big AAA games takes longer to come out than console because a studio has to "prioritise what sells".
