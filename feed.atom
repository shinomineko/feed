        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima dropped a bombshell at the end of January, announcing that - alongside development of Death Stranding 2 - he would also be returning to the action-espionage genre that put him on the map with the Metal Gear series, in the form of Physint for PlayStation 5. And now, in a new episode of his HideoTube web series, the designer has explained how a period of sickness and surgery - and thoughts of his own mortality - convinced him to 'change his priorities' and do something fans had been asking him to do for years.


During the hour-long episode (thanks GameSpot), Kojima explained how, after departing Konami and establishing his independent Kojima Productions studio, he "wanted to do something new with my own IP" and "challenge myself", leading to Death Stranding. "Then, to create a franchise," he continued, "I made Death Stranding 2. And I wanted to do something even newer, so I started working on OD. And since then, there have been a lot of new ideas."


However, Kojima revealed that during those eight years, "Every day on social media, from users all around the world, people have been asking me to create another Metal Gear and stuff like that." But it wasn't until he became ill in 2020, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, that those requests began to take on a more significant meaning.

The single, which features German singer-songwriter Zoe Wees, was released today and accompanied by a music video. The video is a collaboration between Jones and The Pokémon Company International, and sees Pikachu being abducted onto a UFO-turned-stadium where Jones and Wees are performing.
Pikachu isn't that mad about being abducted though, as he happily greets the two and dances along before illuminating (or rather electrocuting) the entire stadium. Ceruledge also makes a sneaky appearance towards the beginning of the video, as a projection onto the sides of some buildings.

Discussing the long-awaited project with investors last night, Guillemot justified the live service game launching with a £70 price tag as it being a fully-formed experience that was also supported by a battle pass, premium currency and an in-game store.


"You will see that Skull and Bones is a full-fledged game," Guillemot said. "It's a very big game and we feel that people will really see how vast and complete that game is. So it's a really full triple-A, quadruple-A game that will deliver in the long run."

The Meta Quest exclusive released in November 2023, and lets players step into the shoes of series protagonists Ezio, Kassandra, and Connor.
Nexus VR isn't mentioned at all in Ubisoft's Q3 earnings press release, but the game was addressed by Guillemot during its conference call (as reported by VGC).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A series of Easter eggs point to us seeing more of Batman in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, presumably as part of a forthcoming post-launch update. 


In-game calendar pages posted around the game's Metropolis map have been spotted by Batman Arkham Videos, and verified by Eurogamer. Each features a circled date, with a hidden code that spells out a secret message.


Substituting the date marked on each calendar page (the eighth of January, for example) with the corresponding letter of the alphabet (H, the eighth letter) spells out the following phrase:  "He Will Return".

While specific sales have not been noted in its latest report, games released in the last quarter include Sonic Superstars, Persona 5 Tactica, Total War: Pharaoh, and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.


However, its latest releases suggest a more positive quarter is on the horizon, despite the company lowering its forecast.

During the earnings call with investors, Zelnick said Take-Two is "currently working on a significant cost reduction program". A similar cost reduction program was announced by Take-Two in its third quarter report for 2023, which resulted in some layoffs last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh set of weekly freebies has now arrived on the Epic Games Store, this time in the form of acclaimed visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! and rogue-like brawling RPG Lost Castle - with Dakar Desert Racing to follow next week.


Starting with Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!, it's the enhanced and expanded version of developer Team Salvato renowned 2017 freeware visual novel of the same name (minus the 'Plus!' bit, obviously) that starts out innocently enough - with players taking on the role of a new student who can romance the anime-styled members of the titular club - before taking a metatextual turn into considerably darker territory.


If that's not your thing - and its Epic Games Store listing makes it clear Doki Doki isn't "suitable for children or those who are easily disturbed" - your other freebie option is Lost Castle. This is a "super cute, super hard action RPG with roguelike elements and randomised dungeons" from Hunter Studio, and it supports four-player co-op and PvP both locally and online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Satirical sci-fi shooter sequel Helldivers 2 has got off to a solid start on Steam, with today's launch propelling it to the number three position on the platform's best-sellers list, while its concurrent players have hit over 64,000 in less than a day. However, player reception has been mixed thanks to a range of issues on PC (it's also out on PS5), and developer Arrowhead Game Studios has now responded, saying fixes are on the way.


Helldivers 2 - which follows the same co-op template as its well-received predecessor, albeit with a switch from top-down perspective to third-person - has so far settled on a Steam rating of "mixed" after over 5,300 reviews, with players highlighting a range of launch-day woes.


Chief among criticisms are complaints about persistent crashes, while others have singled out server and matchmaking issues. Then there's ire directed towards PC optimisation, and its kernel-level GameGuard anti-cheat software, which some feel is cause for concern, as well as complaints around Helldivers 2's monetisation - which includes a battle pass and premium currency in-game shop, despite the game's £34.99/$39.99 USD price tag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds has moved to address fan concerns following publisher Krafton's announcement that the underwater survival sequel will be a multiplayer title adopting a "game-as-a-service model".


Krafton made the claims in its latest financial earnings report, which also brought the news Subnautica 2 - the third game in Unknown Worlds' series, following on from the acclaimed 2018 original and its 2021 continuation Subnautica: Below Zero - would be out this year. And with fans beginning to express displeasure at the apparent swerve away from the solo, self-contained survival action of previous Subnautica games, Unknown Worlds quickly sprung into action, offering clarification on its blog.


Starting with the multiplayer announcement, that much is apparently true, with Subnautica 2 confirmed to be playable co-operatively with up to four players. However, Unknown Worlds stresses the sequel "is not multiplayer-focused", and that co-op is "entirely optional", with players also able to play the game entirely solo if they choose.

        <updated>2024-02-08T17:54:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Codename Red - which takes the long-running series to feudal Japan - will launch before the end of Ubisoft's current financial year next March, CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed, with the publisher's open-world Star Wars Outlaws still targeting a release in 2024.


Guillemot shared the news as part of Ubisoft's latest earnings results - for the third quarter of fiscal 2023-24 - in which he touted a "very promising line-up" for the year to come. That line-up includes a 2024 release for Massive Entertainment's highly anticipated Star Wars Outlaws, suggesting Ubisoft isn't expecting any further slippage after it was reportedly delayed out of the publisher's current fiscal year - ending 31st March 2024 - and into the next.


The bigger news, though, is confirmation that Ubisoft's next blockbuster-sized Assassin's Creed game - currently only known as Codename Red, despite confirmation of its feudal Japan setting - will be coming in fiscal year 2025, meaning a release before 31st March next year. Historically, the Assassin's Creed franchise has avoided the spring launch window, suggesting Red could also be targeting 2024 - as previously reported - unless Ubisoft is breaking with tradition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Nexus Mods' words: "A beast of monstrous proportions is approaching." Today, the mod distribution site - home to some of the best community made video game additions (looking at you Shrek and Thomas) - will hit 10bn downloads.
To put that milestone into some perspective, "if every download were a footstep, you could walk to the moon 11 times, or walk The Seven Thousand Steps to High Hrothgar 4,161,464 times," Nexus Mods said.
Meanwhile, if you are more like me and find it easier to envision things with pizza slices, if Nexus Mods celebrated each download with a slice of thick crust Margherita with extra cheese, "this pizza would cover 15 times the size of Manhattan Island". These are facts you simply knead to know to appreciate how monumental this milestone really is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A re-release of the 90s point-and-click Discworld game "may happen", designer Gregg Barnett has teased. However, the developer said because of the way intellectual property rights work in the UK, 50 percent of the game currently belongs to the crown, which complicates matters a tad.


Discworld was originally released in 1995, having been created with input from Discworld novels author Terry Pratchett. On its launch, the game was well-received, with many complimenting its humour. It became a classic of its time, and a source of many fond memories. I can still recall the voice of Eric Idle's Rincewind perfectly.
A sequel then followed in the form of Discworld 2: Missing Presumed...!? in 1996, before Discworld Noir arrived in 1999.

That's according to a fresh account with further details on the fallout from Activision's now-legendary ousting of West and Zampella, as published on LinkedIn by lead designer Paul Sandler (spotted by PC Gamer). 


Sandler writes that he was told about the loss of West and Zampella by a fellow employee who rode a scooter around the Infinity Ward office, sharing the news. "I just sat there in stunned silence with my eyes wide open," Sandler wrote. "I stood up from my chair and said: 'What the fuck? ...Why?'"

"As for Jensen, we say goodbye, but hopefully not farewell. Maybe someone else will buy the licence. Maybe we'll make an animated series or finish the game. Elon Musk is a big fan, I think he has some money. Someone ask him!"

<blockquote><p>Section 1 of this paper sets the stage by briefly describing the problem to be solved. Section 2 canvasses the different fields of law (warranty, negligence, products liability, and certification) that could provide a starting point for what would have to be legislative action establishing a system of software liability. The conclusion is that all of these fields would face the same question: How buggy is too buggy? Section 3 explains why existing software development frameworks do not provide a sufficiently definitive basis for legal liability. They focus on process, while a liability regime should begin with a focus on the product&#8212;­that is, on outcomes. Expanding on the idea of building codes for building code, Section 4 shows some examples of product-focused standards from other fields. Section 5 notes that already there have been definitive expressions of software defects that can be drawn together to form the minimum legal standard of security. It specifically calls out the list of common software weaknesses tracked by the MITRE Corporation under a government contract. Section 6 considers how to define flaws above the minimum floor and how to limit that liability with a safe harbor...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

In a letter submitted to a US Federal Appeals Court yesterday - first spotted by The Verge - the FTC argued the company's layoff plan differs from how Microsoft represented itself in court proceedings ahead of the merger's closure last year.
"Microsoft represented to this Court that 'the post-merger company will be structured and operated in a way that would readily enable Microsoft to divest any or all of the Activision businesses as robust market participants in the unlikely event that such a divestiture is ordered'," FTC counsel Imad D. Abyad wrote.

The lawsuit, originally filed in November by a Californian minor and his mother, alleges that Take-Two is guilty of civil theft and unfair business practicies for closing down servers for various NBA 2K, WWE 2K and PGA Tour 2K titles, causing players to lose access to any remaining in-game funds they have paid for.


"VC [virtual currency] is not plaintiff's property," a Take-Two lawyer stated this week, as reported by Game File. "Instead, in-game VC are fictions created by game publishers, subject to the publishers’ terms of service and user agreements."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a fan of The Sims and Sims-like experiences, it’s quite an exciting time; The Sims 5, or whatever it’ll be called, is slowly fomenting over at EA, then there’s the imminent release of Paradox’s Life By You following a number of delays, and even the charmingly lo-fi Tiny Life for old-school Sims fans. Perhaps the game that’s generated the most excitement since its unveiling back in 2019 is Paralives, and after a long old wait - and five years of crowdfunding support - developer Paralives Studio has announced it'll be entering early access next year.


That bit of information comes via Paralives new live mode gameplay video - live mode in Sims parlance is the bit where digital chracters actively go about their daily business, as opposed to the customisation-focused build mode - which focuses of the life of Anisa as she moves into a new apartment and begins to get to know the neighbourhood and her new neighbours.


There's a look at how a Para's personality can be created - initially by raising or lowering their physique, mind, creativity, and charisma attributes, as well as adding a "vibe", social perk, talent, and through various lifestyle toggles - and after that it's time to go outside.

During a recent livestream (thanks, wccftech), industry insider Lance McDonald discussed unannounced plans to bring Dreams, released for PS4 in 2020, to both PC and PS5 - and that versions of these projects were near-complete. 


Back in 2020, Eurogamer was told by developer Media Molecule that Dreams already ran on PS5, though this version was part of the studio simply "exploring" the hardware. Separately, Eurogamer had heard of the game's PC port being in development, alongside other Sony projects that have released on PC over the years.

Software engineer Sydney F. is another known to be laid off from Visual Concepts Austin this month. "It's definitely rough," she wrote, stating she is one of "several other amazing colleagues" to have been affected by the studio cuts. "I will miss all of those that I worked with greatly."

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior: behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld developer Pocketpair has detailed a patch that will ensure all those Pals sent to the breeding farm will no longer be so exhausted from reproducing they go to sleep and never wake up.
In addition to this life saving fix, the studio has also addressed game crashes that would corrupt save data when the number of Pals captured by the guild reached approximately 7000. It noted following its previous patch, "save data that had already been in this state (for servers, the server's world data) remained in a broken state that made it impossible to load". However, this latest Palworld patch will resolve that.
Pocketpair has also implemented a variety of countermeasures against some cheats and exploits, but it has not gone into specifics.

The lawsuit alleges McMahon sexually assaulted and sex trafficked an employee while running WWE, and claims an unnamed wrestler then requested an explicit video of the victim from McMahon during a contract renegotiation. 


The Wall Street Journal has said that wrestler is Lesnar. McMahon has denied the allegations in the lawsuit. Lesnar has not responded to requests for comment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If your nights spent kingly (or queenly) crusading have been growing a little stale of late, Paradox Interactive would like you to know there's a busy year ahead for its acclaimed medieval grand strategy game, with its newly revealed 2024 Crusader Kings 3 roadmap promising two new large-scale expansions and more to freshen up that sandbox.


2024 marks the start of what Paradox is calling Crusader Kings 3: Chapter 3, which includes the aforementioned two expansions - Legends of the Dead and Roads to Power - plus the Wandering Nobles event pack, and the Couture of the Capets cosmetic clothing DLC.


Legends of the Dead is up first, falling under the banner of what Paradox likes to call a Core Expansion - which is to say, sizeable but not quite as sizeable as Crusader Kings 3's Major Expansions. Legends of the Dead is, as its name suggests, primarily concerned with legends, giving players the means to raise their renown and strengthen the legitimacy of their rule by either commissioning an epic tale of their general awesomeness - which can then be usefully spread around the place - or by actually going out and doing some heroic deeds themselves.

The new system is set to be announced in spring, with multiple sources at the conference call stating it will be in effect in April. That would align with the company's new financial year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valiant Hearts: Coming Home looks to be making its way to consoles in the future. 


The First World War Ubisoft sequel was previously exclusive to Netflix on mobile, having been announced during 2022's Game Awards. However, this exclusivity may be over soon, as a post by Brazil's ratings board (spotted by VGC) has the game listed for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. 


Valiant Hearts: Coming Home is described as a "dramatic narrative game" by Ubisoft, and sees players following the interweaving stories of James, Anna, Ernst and George. Walt (the first game's canine companion) returns in the sequel to help players work their way through these stories, which include themes of friendship, survival and sacrifice "amidst the turmoil and tragedy of war".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Henry Cavill has hung up the long white locks of The Witcher's Geralt, and is now ready for his next foray into the gaming adaptation sphere with Warhammer, calling it the "greatest privilege" of his career.
Back in 2022, the actor signed a deal with Amazon to bring Warhammer 40,000 to our television screens. Even before this deal, Cavill was known to be famously into Warhammer 40,000, often talking about it in interviews. He once even corrected Graham Norton during an interview when the host mistakenly called Warhammer World of Warcraft.
Cavill's long-time love for Warhammer is apparent even further thanks to a recent interview with Josh Horowitz (thanks, PC Gamer). When asked about the upcoming Warhammer 40,000 project, Cavill said it was the "greatest privilege of [his] professional career" to have this opportunity.

In an investor call today, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the company would lay out its plan for the coming financial year at its next earnings briefing, expected in May (thanks, Bloomberg).


For now, Nintendo reported a rosy set of results, with better-than-estimated numbers for Switch sales and overall profit. The current Nintendo Switch now stands at 139m sold - around 38m more than the Wii.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If it's demos you want, today's your lucky day; Valve's thrice-yearly Steam Next Fest event is back for another outing, this time featuring "hundreds" of demos across its seven-day duration.


Valve's latest Steam Next Fest is already underway and runs until Monday, 12th February. That means you've got approximately 160 hours to piledrive your way through everything on offer - which, given the magnitude of the task, is probably a literal impossibility at this point. But then we live in a world where someone finished Dark Souls 3 with a banana, so what do I know.


As usual, Valve has tried to make the whole Sisyphean challenge a little less daunting by sorting all those playable demos into easily perusable categories on its Steam Next Fest landing page. And while you're there, you can also take in some of the "hours" of developer livestreams running across the week, as if you didn't already have enough to be getting on with.

All this began earlier this year, when reports surfaced that Microsoft could be preparing to release Tango Gameworks' acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush on PlayStation and Switch - a rumour that was rapidly followed by claims Rare's multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves is also readying for release on competing consoles. However, reports began snowballing this weekend, with Starfield, Bethesda's upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and even Gears of War all emerging as candidates for a potential PlayStation release.


As the rumours of Xbox first-party titles going multiplatform have steadily escalated, Microsoft has remained silent, but Xbox boss Phil Spencer has now - following a dramatic day of reports from numerous reliable sources - taken to social media to announce that Xbox will be outlining its future plans in an official "business update event" coming next week.

That's according to Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb, who made the claim in the latest edition of his Game Mess Mornings podcast (thanks VGC). Addressing the recent spate of rumours about first-party Xbox games heading to PlayStation - which so far include Starfield, Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, and Bethesda's upcoming Indiana Jones game - Grubb said, "The other one that I've heard that's definitely under consideration...is Gears of War".


"It doesn't mean that it's going to happen," he added, "but it's in talks".

XboxEra's Nick Baker and Jon Clarke said they both had received "evidence" that Sony has ideas to remake the first Uncharted game from the "ground up". 


"It is worth saying that the additional detail I got was that this was, this was quite old - like I am talking a number of years," Clarke warned. "But it wouldn't surprise me, right... as a way to bring the series back into the limelight again and get people hyped."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major Xbox console exclusives such as Bethesda's Starfield and the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are being considered for launch on Sony's PlayStation 5, as part of a huge shift in strategy by Microsoft. 


Previous reports suggested Xbox would bring a handful of smaller titles to PlayStation beginning this year, including Hi-Fi Rush - something Eurogamer understood to be true and also which has now seemingly been confirmed by its in-game files. But the idea that Microsoft will also - at some point - drop exclusivity for some of its biggest games marks a policy change far bigger than previously expected. 


A swathe of reports emerged last night suggesting Microsoft's PlayStation plans now included Starfield - Xbox's tentpole release for 2023, albeit one which received a somewhat mixed reception - and potentially also Indiana Jones - the company's biggest release currently on the calendar for 2024.

Confirmation came via co-game director Anthony Newman, who revealed during in the fantastic behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, that for the first four or five months of development, The Last of Us Part 2 was a "purely melee focussed" game that "kept getting bigger and bigger as you explored", as inspired by FromSoft's fan-favourite adventure.
"When we started out making The Last of Us Part 2, Neil actually wanted to be very ambitious about changing the game almost entirely," explained Newman.

In a tweet, Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe posted a snippet of how the cost of servers have changed since the game launched just a few short weeks ago, joking – I hope, anyway – that the studio could "go bankrupt from server fees".
Not that that kind of cost is prohibitive, apparently; Palworld network engineer Chujo Hiroto replied to their boss' message, revealing to the world that they'd been instructed to "never let the service go down no matter what".

The card was initially a free add-on for Pokémon customers, given out at a rate of one card for each item in the Van Gogh collection bought, but scalpers descended onto the store in droves, wiped out the supply, and then immediately put their wares on internet auction sites at grossly inflated prices.
Shortly after, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam confirmed it will not be restocking its promotional Pokémon card following "safety and security concerns" for its staff and customers, and we learned just last month that four employees of the museum in Amsterdam were eventually suspended for misconduct.

Talking in the fascinating behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, Laura Bailey confirmed that the "real hardcore death threats" were so concerning, they were passed on to police, whilst her baby son – who was "born during all of it" – also received threats, too.
The threats – sent because the fictional character she played did something to another fictional character that a subset of so-called fans didn't like – became so serious that she even had to turn some over to the police to ensure her safety.

According to a blog posted on the official website, it seems that for 24 minutes on 30th January, players partaking in the new Squad Builder Challenges (SBC) had a spectacularly high chance of securing the 86+ OVR untradeable Lionel Messi card worth hundreds of pounds.
EA was notified of the issue and pulled the challenge within half an hour, but it was already too late; thousands of players had already snagged it, leading those  who had not been so lucky to call for EA to level the playing field – literally and metaphorically – and gift the card to all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami is reportedly "potentially porting" the Silent Hill series to contemporary consoles.
That's according to one of five short documentaries Konami published on YouTube the night it shadow-dropped The Short Message.
In the fourth video, a level designer who worked on the highly-anticipated (and long rumoured) playable teaser revealed that Konami had originally reached out to the team at Hexadrive – a studio that had primarily worked on porting older games until it helped an internal Konami team develop The Short Message – "about potentially porting the Silent Hill series".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming free-to-play skateboard sim, Skate, will be available on PC via Steam.
The news was confirmed by lead creative writer Cuz Parry, who revealed that the fan-favourite skating game would be coming to PC via Steam for the very first time in a Q&A video posted to YouTube just a couple of days before the holidays.
As PC Gamer points out, the news went largely unnoticed at the time, so it was only when the social media team confirmed it was "stoked to announce Skate will be available on Steam for PC players" earlier this week that news began to spread.

Talking at the very end of the fascinating behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, Druckmann acknowledged that whilst he didn't yet have a story fully fleshed out, he did have a kernel of an idea that "is as exciting as [The Last of Us Part 1]".
"If we never get to do it again, this is a fine ending point. The last bite of the apple, the story's done," Druckmann said.

"As of one month ago, no next-gen contract with AMD had been signed with Microsoft," they said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a bit of bad news if, like us, you were quietly hoping Citizen Sleeper 2 might just squeak out before the end of 2024; developer Jump Over The Age has confirmed there's still "around a year left of development" on its eagerly anticipated narrative sci-fi RPG sequel. 


Jump Over The Age - AKA developer Gareth Damian Martin - announced they were working on a follow-up to the hugely well-received Citizen Sleeper back in June last year. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, as the sequel is known, introduces a brand-new Sleeper android protagonist in a new setting where players will need to build themselves a life among the stars, piloting their own ramshackle stolen ship populated by a crew they've recruited themselves.


An update in August gave us a first look at a new location in Citizen Sleeper 2 - a bustling way station known as Hexport - as well as confirmation it'll be releasing for PC via both Game Pass and Steam. What we didn't get, though, was any hint of  an ETA for Citizen Sleeper 2 - and that's where Jump Over The Age's lastest update comes in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has announced another delay for its ambitious Sims-like Life By You, which is now due to enter Steam and Epic Games Store early access on 4th June.


Life By You, the first game from Paradox's Tectonic studio (headed up by former Sims boss and Second Life CEO Rod Humble), was officially unveiled last March, promising a game that would let players "create humans and live out their lives without loading screens".


It is, essentially, the Sims, albeit with a few key selling points intended to differentiate it from the current iteration of EA's juggernaut franchise: it's fully open-world with no loading screens, it features "real language conversation", its digital human can optionally be controlled directly in first-person, and "everything is customisable". It also sports a more realistic art style compared to the Sims 4, which, last year at least, unfortunately looked both drab and bland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As acclaimed first-person automation sim Satisfactory inches closer to the fifth anniversary of its early access launch, developer Coffee Stain Studios has revealed it's eyeing up a version 1.0 release "this year", and that the game has now sold over 5.5m copies.


Satisfactory released into early access back in March 2019 - initially as an Epic Games Store exclusive before making the jump to Steam the following year - and it quickly made a splash thanks its co-operative, open-world spin on the automated resource exploitation loop popularised by deeloper Wube Software's much-loved Factorio.


In Satisfatory, Factorio's irresistably compulsive fundamental formula - in which, essentially, you mine stuff to craft stuff that'll make mining more stuff easier so you can craft bigger stuff and so on - plays in first-person across a vibrant, explorable sci-fi open-world, with up to four friends able to work together to achieve their goals. It's a twist that's clearly resonated with people too, as developer Coffee Stain has now revealed Satisfactory has sold over 5.5m copies since early access began.

A teaser on the Sonic the Hedgehog film account features a laugh from the villain, hinting at his return. "You all thought I was gone, but I've just been underground," it reads. "What you've seen from me is only a shadow of things to come..."

The report was published by German PC gaming outlet GameStar and YouTube channel Game Two earlier this week, and is based on testimonies from 16 former Fntastic employees, one volunteer, and seven employees at publisher Mytona.
The claims paint a bleak image of the working environment at Fntastic, which include allegations of toxic management, in particular co-founders Eduard and Aysen Gotovtsev, and a lack of direction.

Well, I presume it should be read that way anyway. However, a nice big splash of red blood has covered up the middle word, leaving only 'We're' and 'Dead' on show. Seems kind of sus...

<blockquote><p>There are several ways two people can divide a piece of cake in half. One way is to find someone impartial to do it for them. This works, but it requires another person. Another way is for one person to divide the piece, and the other person to complain (to the police, a judge, or his parents) if he doesn&#8217;t think it’s fair. This also works, but still requires another person&#8212;­at least to resolve disputes. A third way is for one person to do the dividing, and for the other person to choose the half he wants.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point is that unlike protocols that require a neutral third party to complete (arbitrated), or protocols that require that neutral third party to resolve disputes (adjudicated), self-enforcing protocols just work. Cut-and-choose works because neither side can cheat. And while the math can get really complicated, the idea ...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infamous Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser believes the company used him as an example, and says his prison sentence and fine are designed to send a message to others who cross the company in the future.
To quickly recap, Bowser was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices back in 2022. The Canadian programmer had worked as part of a larger hacking group known as Team Xecuter, which in turn made millions from the sale of devices which enabled pirated video games to be played on a number of Nintendo's consoles. At the time of his sentence, Bowser pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, as well as an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo's own civil lawsuit against him.
Bowser was subsequently released from prison last year, however he will remain in debt to Nintendo for decades to come. In April, Bowser said Nintendo is now able to recoup 25-30 percent of his personal income for the rest of his working life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, developer Tango Gameworks distributed a relatively minor Hi-Fi Rush update to celebrate the first anniversary of the acclaimed rhythm-brawler's release; however, dataminers poking around the update's innards are now claiming to have found further evidence - in the form of unique t-shirt designs - that a PlayStation and Switch launch is on the way.


Reports that the previously PC and Xbox exclusive Hi-Fi Rush could be making its way to PlayStation and Switch first began circulating in January, after a number of reliable leakers started expanding on claims by insider Nate the Hate that Microsoft was set to "one of [its] more acclaimed first party releases to a competitor system" this year.


And while there's been no sign of an official announcement to back up those reports in the weeks since, datamined discoveries in Hi-Fi Rush's latest update (thanks Wario64) have lent further credence to the rumours. Patch 7, as last week's update is officially known, includes an Anniversary T-Shirt Bundle containing new clothing for Chai to wear. Four of these designs are available to everyone, while three are exclusive to the platform - Xbox, Steam, or the Epic Games Store - players own the game on. However, a number of dataminers are now claiming to have unearthed two additional, unused T-shirts in the update, looking suspiciously like exclusive designs for Switch and PlayStation.

The Forever Labyrinth, which has been made in partnership with the Google Arts & Culture initiative, transports players to an ever-shifting maze of rooms - resembling everything from serene gardens to clifftops, forests, and cellars - as they search for their friend Professor Sheldrake, who's lost amid its mysterious interlinking passageways.


These passageways take the form of paintings and art - "drawn from the collections of great museums who are keen to share their treasures in new and exciting ways online", as the press release puts it - scattered around each room. By collecting clues and identifying elements present within the artwork, players can learn to navigate the labyrinth and hopefully find their friend - if the monster ceaselessly devouring the world doesn't get them first.

Tales of Kenzera, a Metroidvania-style side-scrolling action-adventure, was unveiled by Salim during an emotional appearance at last year's The Game Awards in which he paid tribute to his late father. "For a long time," he explained, "I've struggled to find a way of communicating my journey with grief. To now be able to do that through Zau's story of loss, growth and healing in Tales of Kenzera: Zau feels so right."


Taking inspiration from African Bantu tales, the game - which is being developed by Salim's Surgent Studios and published by EA via its Originals label - follows the journey of Zau, a young shaman who bargains with the God of death to bring his Baba back from darkness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a cautious, gradual roll-out to stop everything blowing up in a tangle of lost progress and Tenno tears, developer Digital Extremes has announced that free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe's long-awaited cross-platform save feature is now available to all players.


Digital Extremes has been slowly working away on Warframe's cross-platform support for a number of years now; cross-play was first introduced back in December 2022, while cross-save - enabling players to pick up where they left off regardless of the platform they're playing on - starting rolling out in December last year.


At the time, Digital Extremes explained it would be taking a cautious approach and introducing cross-save in phases, to avoid risking timeouts caused by high demand - something that could potentially be catastrophic for a feature as sensitive as account merging. Since then, it's been rolling out cross-save support to players in batches, but today brings the news it'll now be immediately available to anyone that wants to take advantage of the feature.

In short, her exclusivity deal with the Amazon-owned streaming platform came to an end and Pokimane decided not to renew the contract. "The end of an era," she posted on X, formerly Twitter. "Twitch has been my home for a decade...but it's time to say thank you for all the memories and love during my League, Fortnite, and Among Us days."


It means Twitch - a platform derided for its lack of diversity - has just lost one of its most popular and high profile female streamers and, on her podcast series Don't Tell Anyone, she detailed her concerns about the platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have been wanting to play Alan Wake 2, but were put off by the game's semi-regular, flashing jump scares, I have good news. 


As part of its recent update, Remedy has added a feature that will allow you to tone down those horror flashes (apparently a much-requested addition). Players can now opt for either a Low or Normal visual and audio intensity of horror flash, to curate the game better to their liking. 


Along with this option to dial back on the scaries, the studio has also introduced a Chapter Select function. This will allow players to load up any mission they fancy as long as they have previously unlocked it. Yes, this means you can go back and replay Alan Wake 2's awesome musical moments again and again and again.

The game is described as a story-driven adventure, built exclusively for VR. It promises plenty of stealth and a good dash of combat, with the developer stating this will be the "most immersive" Metro experience to date. 


You will play as Serdar in Metro Awakening. Serdar is "a doctor and a rationalist" in search of medication for his wife. This search will take players to the tunnels beneath Moscow, but it won't be an easy trip. You see, the tunnels are full of mutants.  "As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become..." the official blurb teases. You can see Metro Awakening's announcement trailer below.

        <updated>2024-01-31T23:45:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a good long while since we've seen anything concrete from Konami and developer Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake, but the project has now received a fresh airing as part of Sony's latest PlayStation State of Play showcase, this time with a trailer focusing on the game's "improved and modernised" combat.


Combat perhaps isn't the first thing you'd expect Konami's marketing material to dwell on given it's quite some way down the list of elements that made the original Silent Hill 2 such a beloved horror experience, but the trailer does, in fairness, hang back a whole 40 seconds before switching out the atmospheric meandering for bat-swinging, shotgun-blasting action.


Additionally, it's reassuring, and perhaps even a little surprising, to see just how closely Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake hews to aesthetic of the original 2001 PlayStation 2 game - it certainly doesn't look like we're in for a radical tonal reinvention here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During this evening's State of Play, we were all treated to a brand new and rather surreal look at Death Stranding 2, officially now known as On the Beach (as suspected). 


The sequel was first announced to be in development back in 2022 during the Game Awards, with a  bamboozling trailer featuring Léa Seydoux and Norman Reedus.


Tonight's trailer has now given us another slice of Kojima-infused pie, and once again it is as perplexing as you would expect. It includes a rather epic looking battle that I won't spoil by trying to describe it here. We also got a brief look at Elle Fanning's Death Stranding 2 character. The actress was first confirmed to be part of the sequel a while ago, after a series of enigmatic teases from Kojima (although, we all guessed).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive Games' hugely entertaining PS4 slasher horror Until Dawn is - as was widely reported prior today's PlayStation State of Play showcase - getting a PlayStation 5 and PC remaster, and it'll be launching later this year.


The original Until Dawn released for PlayStation 4 back in 2015, offering up an atmospheric, knowingly cheesy spin on the teen slasher genre whose branching narrative could be nudged in different directions depending on the choices players made - with their actions determining who lived and who died, even what sort of threat they might be facing. 


Supermassive later returned to the well with its similarly styled Dark Pictures Anthology series, but Until Dawn is still regarded as highpoint for the studio, so it's nice to see it get a bit of a refresh - or "rebuilt and enhanced" as Sony is putting it - for a new generation of players.

A new trailer shown during Sony's PlayStation State of Play suggested Judas was set in a futuristic world where everyone's thoughts are recorded - and shown off on a series of screens. 


All these thoughts are "planted in your brain like weeds in a garden", a character who looks slightly similar to BioShock Infinite's Elizabeth suggests, revealing that she's going to help free people from this.

Starting with the games, February's first Essential offering is Foamstars, Square Enix's stylish, Splatoon-esque 4v4 live-service game in which players furiously hose each other into submission with a torrent of slippery soapsuds. It'll be available on both PlayStation 4 and PS5.


Next up is Rollerdrome, from OlliOlli developer Roll7. Set a world ruled by corporations, where the public is kept placated by a brutal blood sport known as Rollerdrome, it sees players donning rollerskates for some high-speed third-person shooting action, where performing tricks restores ammo and bullet-time-style slo-mo can be deployed against opponents.

We've known known developer Pocketpair has had a hit on its hands with Palworld for some time now, of course; its early access launch on 19th January got off a bumpy start as an initial influx of players brought the game's servers to their knees, and just 24 hours later Pocketpair revealed 2m players were already galavanting around the Palapagos Islands.


Shortly after, Palworld became one of only six games ever to hit 1m concurrent players on Steam, and then updated sales figures brought the news it had shifted over 5m copies in just three days. Six days after launch, Steam sales hit 8m, and now, 12 days in, Pocketpair has announced Palworld has surpassed 19m players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of conceptual chatter over on its blog, developer The Chinese Room has finally whipped back the shroud on its version of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, giving a first proper look at its in-game action courtesy of an 15-minute gameplay reveal.


Prior to today, The Chinese Room - which took over the troubled Bloodlines 2 back in 2021, although the studio's involvement wasn't announced until last year - has talked a little about the game's main character, vampire elder Phyre, its clans, and its "visceral immersive combat", and all of that comes together in today's extended gameplay debut.


According to The Chinese Room, this 15-minute first-look features a sequence from relatively early in the game, taking place after Phyre - who in this particular playthrough is part of the Brujah clan, imbuing her with supernatural speed and strength, as well as a rather short fuse - has established herself in Seattle and made inroads with the court. As she investigates the mysterious mark on her hand limiting her powers, she receives a tip-off leading her to a warehouse and a vampire known as Willem who might just have some answers.

Tonight's big PlayStation State of Play broadcast is the first we've heard from Sony this year - and this evening looks set to lay out a line-up of blockbusters coming to PS5 over 2024 - and into 2025.
Join us as we watch and cover everything live from 10pm UK time (GMT) - the show is set to last 40 minutes, and feature 15 games. 
What do we expect? Quite a lot, actually. Sony itself has said to expect "guest appearances from some of the most talented minds in gaming" - and without an invitation ourselves we can only assume this means Hideo Kojima. It's high time we heard more about Death Stranding 2. But who else might also qualify? Our money's on BioShock creator Ken Levine, whose long-awaited Judas is now finally nearing release.

This makes it the fastest selling Resident Evil title "by far" - a stat tracked by Alex Aniel, writer of Itchy Tasty: An Unofficial History of Resident Evil - although the game still sits behind the likes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Village in terms of total sales to date.


In its recent consolidated financial results, Capcom said these more recent Resident Evil 4 sales have been supported by "ongoing promotional measures" such as free updates for the PlayStation VR2 version.

Quizzed on how Switch 2's arrival will impact EA, the company's CEO Andrew Wilson said he could "absolutely not comment on anything that has not been announced or acknowledge it in any way", before going on to say the company was pumped for "new platforms" in general.


"What I would say," Wilson told investors, "to the extent that platforms over the course of the last 20 years have come out and offered improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution... where we're able to deliver more immersion for our players, particularly around our biggest franchises like FC, like Madden, like Battlefield, like Apex that has typically been very good for our business.

But developer Rocksteady has twice had to take Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's servers offline to fix problems with the game - leaving the always-online co-op title completely unplayable in the interim.

Pocketpair has now said it is aware of this app's existence, and warned players not to be fooled by its arrival on the App Store (we've checked, and can't see it on the Google Play store at present).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has shared its Q2 2024 financial results, reporting significant revenue gains across its gaming division - including a massive 61 percent increase in Xbox content and services revenue - following its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


As per its Q2 earnings release, Microsoft's gaming revenue increased by 49 percent compared to the equivalent quarter in its previous financial year, with the company recording a 61 percent boost in Xbox content and services revenue - which encompasses money generated by the likes of  Game Pass - alongside a three percent increase in Xbox hardware revenue.


Unsurprisingly, Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition was a key driver of its Q2 growth, with the deal contributing to just over $2bn in revenue. However, operating expenses and other costs - including transaction- and integration-related costs - saw the net impact of the Activision Blizzard deal result in an operating loss of $440m.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a little under two weeks of Steam beta testing, Starfield's latest patch is now available for all players on PC and Xbox Series X/S, bringing quest fixes, visual improvements, and more.


As noted in Bethesda's announcement post, Starfield's latest update - officially numbered 1.9.51.0 - has received one additional PC crash fix in the jump from beta to full release. That tweak joins "over a hundred fixes and adjustments" detailed in its previous beta patch notes.


For the most part, updated 1.9.51.0 is focused on quality-of-life improvements and quest fixes, with Bethesda saying its quashed instances of bulldozed objects reappearing when returning to an outpost, ship hatches being marked as inaccessible, and more. There's also yet another fix intended to stamp out the lingering issue of asteroids doggedly following ships across the galaxy like overly enthusiastic puppies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If your interests exist squarely within the Venn diagram of Mass Effect and Destiny 2, your day is almost here: Bungie has announced it's teaming up with EA and BioWare to bring Commander Shepard and company - or at least something vaguely inspired by them - to its free-to-play shooter as part of a new collaboration event.


As per Bungie's announcement, the 'Destiny 2 x BioWare' team-up will enable Destiny 2 players to "join the crew of the Normandy" from 13th February - which all sounds very exciting until it finishes its sentence, "with new cosmetics and in-game items".


On the premium cosmetics front, a new Normandy Crew Bundle will be available in the Eververse store once the event begins, containing a Commander Shepard-inspired N7 armour set for Titans, a Garrus-inspired Vakarian set for Hunters, and a Liara-inspired Shadow Broker set for Warlocks. An Omni Strike finisher and Flux Dance will also be purchasable with Silver.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hinterland, the developer behind snowy survival game The Long Dark, has teased an 'unannounced survival game' currently in development at the studio, and the accompanying alpha footage certainly has the hallmarks of a potential The Long Dark 2.


Hinterland boss Raphael van Lierop (who confirmed he was stepping away from The Long Dark to start a new project at the studio back in 2022) shared the 22 seconds of "in-engine pre-alpha" footage on social media today, along with the caption, "Some good things happening in the Unannounced Survival Games space...".


The video itself is little more than a slow pan across a slightly ramshackle room - but a closer look might just offer some big clues as to the nature of Hinterland's new project. A running tally of "days" scrawled on the mirror and the general makeshift dilapidation of the room certainly suggest some kind of disaster has befallen the world outside, while the two roaring fires and the howling wind absolutely bring The Long Dark's big freeze to mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all knew Nintendo would come after the Palworld Pokémon mod, but its modder has quickly struck back with a new download which replaces Palworld's friendly Pals with totally original "legally distinct" and "legit copyright free" pocket creatures.
Last week, YouTuber ToastedShoes took the Palworld's close Pokémon comparisons to the extreme, with an unlicensed Pokémon mod. Footage of the mod remained on the internet for about a day, before Nintendo got to work scrubbing it away. 
The Pokémon Company itself soon responded, stating its intent to "investigate and take appropriate measures" regarding anything that could infringe on its copyright. Meanwhile, modding hub Nexus Mods released its own statement confirming it won't host Pokémon-themed Palworld mods thanks to the "headache of DMCA/legal threats from Nintendo".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale, the upcoming gaslamp fantasy game from Inflexion Games, will get a server stress test this Friday, 2nd February. It's a one-day only affair - if that - running from 6pm to 9pm UK time (1pm to 4pm Eastern). 


Randomly selected players who had previously signed up for the test will start receiving access to the game one hour before. Others will then be invited to play in batches. Again, this will be random, so keep an eye out for an email from Steam.


"Our goal is for all players who signed up for the test to be able to participate. How quickly that happens will be dependent on how the test progresses," Inflexion said, explaining it will granting access in waves to assess how servers handle large amounts of players logging in at the same time and the developer's ability to rapidly scale up in response.

Plenty of fans have noted how well suited Tifa would be to the fighting game series, but Harada's X (formerly Twitter) post about Rebirth and Tekken 8 booths being next to each other at the Taipei Game Show spurred on fan desires.


"All I'm gonna say... is what everyone else here is saying... but I'm gonna say it anyways... because 'Tifa Lockhart' would be absolutely INCREDIBLE if she made it into 'Tekken 8' this time Harada-San!!!," replied one fan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Footage from a cancelled futuristic Call of Duty sci-fi game in development by Tony Hawk's studio Neversoft has leaked online. 


The footage was spotted by Call of Duty insider account CharlieIntel, and seemingly comes from a cancelled Xbox 360-era Call of Duty game known as Future Warfare (or "NX1" internally). The game was originally in development at Neversoft, which was ultimately merged into Infinity Ward in 2014.


Confirming the footage as legitimate, former Neversoft developer Brian Bright said this cancelled Call of Duty release would have launched in place of Ghosts. "Neversoft pivoted from Guitar Hero to make a futuristic COD game," Bright wrote on X. "I believe this would have been in place of Ghosts, trying to remember. We had two to three campaign missions, and a bunch of [multiplayer] work done (I was lead MP on this) before cancellation."

The upcoming game – which, like Pocketpair's predecessor, is fielding accusations of alleged plagiarism given its striking similarity to another fan-favourite Metroidvania game – doesn't yet have a release date, but is expected to release in the next three months, offering up to four-player multiplayer.
Unlike Palworld, however, Pocketpair isn't listed as this game's developer, only its publisher. Pocketpair was listed as the developer up until three days ago, but after a quick check with SteamDB, it seems this was changed on 25 January 2024.

Whilst Sony rolled out the change without explicitly acknowledging the change, Cronus Zen users soon noticed their devices were being disconnected following the PS5 update earlier this week, prompting Cronus to issue a statement to players affected by the change.
The developer behind Cronus Zen describes the device as one that allows players to connect "any supported controller, mouse, keyboard or racing wheel, to any major gaming console platform", offering an advanced scripting engine "that allows you to run powerful macros".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gears of War creator Cliff "CliffyB" Bleszinski says Palworld's astonishing success "kinda validates" a pitch he'd made to Epic "many years ago".
In a post shared to Twitter/X, Bleszinski said he took the idea of "medieval Pokémon with baby dragons instead" to Epic, but the idea was "rejected at all the major publishers".
When asked by a curious follower what Epic said when Bleszinski made the pitch, he simply said: "It just… never went anywhere. I wanted to do it on mobile first".

The layoffs are part of Microsoft's decision to lay off 1900 employees across its video game teams. In an email sent to employees, Xbox boss Phil Spencer called this a "painful decision after Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year, and $7.5bn acquisition of Zenimax in 2021. Microsoft also laid off almost 900 positions this time last year, too.

The kart racer based on Bloodborne was initially expected to release at the end of the month, but the indie team now says it needs additional time to "scrub the branding off of" the game.
"Long story short, we need to scrub the branding off of what was previously known as Bloodborne Kart," the team said yesterday. "We will do this, but that requires a short delay."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sker Ritual – the round-based co-op survival FPS and spin-off to horror, Maid of Sker – has launched a new demo for prospective PS5 players to try before they buy.
The early access co-op horror – which has a "mostly positive" user score aggregated from 650+ Steam players and is currently ranked 3.6 out of 5 on the PS store – already offers demos for PC and Xbox Series X players.
The demo offers players the chance to experience the "fan-favourite" map Cursed Lands of Lavernock, although while the game offers "round-based FPS" for up to four players, the demo is a purely single-player experience, I'm afraid. Full co-op will be available when the horror shooter launches in April 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has shared an update on the farm-life sim's highly anticipated - and long-in-the-works - 1.6 update, saying he's now "done adding major new content" and that it'll "definitely" be out this year.


Barone revealed he was working on a 1.6 update for Stardew Valley back in June 2022, warning it would be relatively modest in scope and 'mostly modding-focused'.


With each new showing, however, 1.6 has seemingly grown more ambitious; by September last year, Barone confirmed it would include one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and crafting recipes, new dialogue lines, a new farm type, new late-game content, winter outfits for villagers, a new larger chest, 8-player co-op on PC, and more - that "and more" encompassing perhaps 1.6's most important addition: hats for cats and dogs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been five months since Paradox Interactive's surprise announcement Everybody's Gone to the Rapture developer The Chinese Room had taken the reins of its troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2; in that time, the studio has been openly discussing its approach to the sequel, with its latest update now focusing on what it's calling "visceral immersive combat".


In a newly shared blog post, creative director Alex Skidmore outlines three main gameplay styles the studio wants accommodate on release, each emphasising or de-emphasising combat in different ways. The first is what it calls the Strategic Stalker, a take on the "vampire predator fantasy" where the focus is on staying hidden and using the element of surprise.


This stealth-focused approach to combat, says Skidmore, is all about sneaking up on an enemy, causing a distraction, then feeding on them quickly before a fight can occur. That's in stark contrast to combat style number two - the Action Brawler - which is for players that want to get stuck straight into a fight using "fast reflexes and combat skills".

Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2 is (as its name very much implies) the sequel to Naughty Dog's original Grounded documentary, which released in 2015 and charted the "dogged development and unique philosophy" of the first The Last of Us game.


This follow-up documentary almost didn't happen; filming was forced to wrap up prematurely when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020, but the footage (which goes back to The Last of Us Part 2's early days in 2016) has now been revisited and assembled into an 85-minutes behind-the-scenes feature exploring the sequel's development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reikon Games has reportedly laid off 60 to 70 people, equating to 56 percent of the company. 


According to Kotaku, layoffs at the Ruiner developer happened on 23rd January. These layoffs were to the surprise of its staff, who said they were "sudden" and "shocking". 


The Poland-based company was established in 2014. It went on to release Ruiner, a brutal action shooter, in 2017. In Eurogamer's Ruiner review, contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called it a "powerfully grim, fleet-footed cyberpunk action odyssey that is caught in the spell of its own nihilism".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has announced an open beta for Skull and Bones. 


The studio's long-in-the-works pirate game has had quite a troubled development, which has resulted in several delays over the last few years. However, it now seems like Skull and Bones is really, actually, finally going to happen. 


Following a closed beta last month, the studio has now announced an open beta, which will run between 8th and 12th February for those of us in the UK, across PC (Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store), PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Preloads kick off on 6th February.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are no current plans to bring Rec Room - the social VR app that's part meeting place, part mini-game hub featuring sporting events, fantastical quests and even games of Charades - to PlayStation VR2. This is because the studio behind it (also known as Rec Room) simply "can't justify the cost", despite its popularity. 


As spotted by UploadVR, Rec Room's CCO and co-founder Cameron Brown recently held an AMA chat on Reddit. Here, the developer stated the team had no current plans to port its popular social MMO to Sony's latest VR platform, even though they and their community would love it to happen. 


"We've looked into it, it's a non-trivial port, and we haven't found a way to make it make economic sense," Brown said. "In an ideal world, we would love to bring [Rec Room] to PSVR2, but we can't justify the cost based on the numbers." The COO said the situation "sucks" but "that's the truth".

Palworld is only the second game to ever manage this. The other is PUBG, which boasts a concurrent player record of 3,257,248 on Valve's platform. 


While Pocketpair's breakout hit is yet to creep over the 3 million bar, it is still welcoming an enormous number of players, with 1,531,287 Pal tamers currently making their way through the world at the time of writing. These numbers will surely increase further over the weekend, when the work week is done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's decision to cut 1900 staff members has reportedly seen the company's games retail teams reduced, prompting fresh questions over Xbox's future in the physical games business. 


Writing on X, Windows Central's Jez Corden said Microsoft had "shut down departments dedicated to bringing Xbox games to physical retail".


Is this the end for boxed Xbox games? Perhaps not yet, Corden continued. Microsoft can outsource physical game production and may be consolidating teams across departments. But the news it has cut staff working on physical game releases comes after Microsoft accidentally revealed it had planned for a digital-only console future as early as this year. And only last week, Microsoft said that one of its key games for this year - Hellblade 2 - would be a digital-only launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard's cancelled survival game, codenamed Odyssey, had been in development for over six years.


Yesterday, it was reported Microsoft was laying off 1900 employees from across its video game teams and that Blizzard's in-the-works survival game had been cancelled. This game was being helmed by ex-Far Cry boss Dan Hay, and would have transported players to a "whole new universe". 


A new report by Bloomberg has now shared further details on Blizzard's newly-cancelled project. The game started development six years ago, following a concept pitch by Blizzard developer Craig Amai in 2017. The idea was to create a survival game in a similar vein to Minecraft and Rust, but with a more polished experience.

Bloomberg today said that Nintendo's next console will feature the company's largest screen size ever, according to an analyst with knowledge of the supply chain. But it will be LCD, rather than OLED - a decision which will help keep costs down.


To compare, the Switch OLED features a seven-inch screen. The original Switch model features a 6.2-inch screen. Nintendo declined to comment when contacted regarding the report.

That's as Epic boss Tim Sweeney calls Apple's revised guidelines "hot garbage".


The iPhone maker revealed sweeping revisions to its App Store guidelines - including confirmation it'll allow developers to submit game streaming apps for the first time - earlier today, albeit with little grace. In a press release announcing the changes, it referenced the "new risks the [Digital Markets Act] poses to EU users", and insisted the new EU-mandated options "for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats."


Apple also says complying with the rules will mean it "has less ability to address other risks — including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PC players who've been patiently awaiting the arrival of Horizon Forbidden West on their platform of choice now have a date to mark in the calendars: the action-adventure sequel is coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store in its Complete Edition guise on 21st March.


Horizon Forbidden West - which continues the adventures of protagonist Aloy in an lush open world populated by majestic robot wildlife - originally launched for PS4 and PS5 back in February 2022, with its Burning Shores expansion arriving the following year.


As you might imagine, the Complete Edition (which launched for PlayStation last October) bundles the base game and expansion together, along with a variety of in-game items. These include an exclusive pose and face paint for Photo Mode, plus five items that can be unlocked by progressing through the story: the Carja Behemoth Elite outfit and Short Bow, the Nora Thunder Elite outfit and Sling, the Apex Clawstrider Machine Strike piece, and a resources pack containing ammunition, potions, and travel packs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With new EU rules against anti-competitive practices looming, Apple has announced it'll soon be permitting developers to release Game-Pass-style catalogue apps, containing multiple playable and streamable games and programmes, onto its official App Store.


Beyond games, Apple says these new catalogue-style apps can also contain "mini-apps, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins", and developers "will be able to" incorporate its In-App Purchase system to offer users paid digital content or services "such as a subscription for an individual chatbot."


Its initial announcement doesn't highlight the cut Apple will be expecting from these new style of apps (currently it charges developers a 30% fee for paid apps and in-app purchases) - or if the use of its In-App Purchase system is mandatory - but it'll likely get into the specifics soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss today's statement from The Pokémon Company that confirms it will investigate Palworld for possible intellectual property infringement. 
It's an unprecedented move by Pokémon to publicly call out Palworld as a game worthy of inspection - after 25 years of rip-offs and clones that have been quietly nuked or ignored. But it also feels inevitable, due to Palworld's enormous spike in interest - seen by its Steam success, and also the sizable controversy swirling around it. The game had simply become too big to ignore.
So, what happens next? On the one hand, you'd think The Pokémon Company would be keen to act if any evidence of infringement can be found - it has to protect its intellectual property, or risk even cheekier Pokémon-style games trying harder in future. On the other, this announcement only feeds the controversy wave Palworld is riding, and risks blowback on Pokémon if the genuinely popular Palworld is unceremoniously removed from millions of people's Steam libraries. With me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Five Nights at Freddy's game leaked online, but rather than getting upset about it, series creator Scott Cawthon has said we can all chat about it. 


The game is called Into the Pit, and is being developed by Mega Cat Studios. When the upcoming release first leaked, the Five Nights at Freddy's Reddit feed said it was going to remove any discussion on it. However, Cawthon himself piped up, and said as it was out there already, the community was welcome to talk about it. 


"No need to keep it all hush-hush. It's okay! Yes, I was trying to keep it a secret for a bit longer, but now that it's out, that's fine," Cawthon wrote. "This game has been in development for a really long time actually, and I'm really proud of the final product. It will be a 10th anniversary game! :)"

In an internal email seen by The Verge, Microsoft's gaming head Phil Spencer called this a "painful decision". 


"It's been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft," Spencer wrote in his email to staff. "As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business. Together, we've set priorities, identified areas of overlap, and ensured that we're all aligned on the best opportunities for growth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video that showed Legendary Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma standing alongside Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto in a very fetching high-vis vest and hard hat combo at Universal Studios Orlando has been pulled from the internet - prompting speculation he was there because a Legend of Zelda attraction is in the works. 


Aonuma could be seen in a behind-the-scenes video from Universal designed to show employee life at the park, and highlight how it will grow in future. Aonuma's inclusion appears to be an accident, however, as the post has since been removed from Instagram. We've asked Nintendo for comment. 


Despite its short life online, the internet has aleady been analysing the video's blink-and-you-will-miss-it shot of Aonuma and Miyamoto chatting together (thanks, Famiboards). Why are they there? What are they discussing? What is the Link between their presence and the parks' future?

Private lobbies are now available as an option for any game mode. These let you set a four-digit passcode so you and your friends can join an individual lobby. But private lobby races won't be reflected on leaderboards, and you'll receive less EXP and fewer ticket points.

Kotaku reported the layoffs last night, and said the studio had 110 employees as of a headcount made public last year. Staff were told of the cuts yesterday, and have begun posting about them on social media. 


The next project from Black Forest Games is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin, a dark and gritty God of War-inspired take on the franchise adapted from the acclaimed comic book series of the same name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Palworld-wide domination continues. Along with some truly monumental numbers on Steam, the open world survival and crafting game - which the internet has dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' - has seen its US numbers on Xbox briefly surpass those of perennial favourite Fortnite.


As noted by NPD's Mat Piscatella, Circana's Player Engagement Tracker showed that Palworld surpassed Fortnite's Xbox numbers in the US on 22nd January. According to the tracker, Xbox players in the US played Palworld for more than 200 minutes, on average. 


While this was a one day thing, and the number of players in each game was "close" (Piscatella said to consider this all a "small-sample data point for funsies stat for now more than anything else"), it is still quite remarkable. In Piscatella's words, these are some "bonkers numbers".

In the statement, released this morning via its Japanese website, The Pokémon Company said it now intends to "investigate" Palworld for any content it believes may "infringe on intellectual property rights related to Pokémon". 


Earlier this week, fans pointed not just to the familiar designs of some Palworld creatures, but to the close similarity seen in Palworld's in-game models to Pokémon data in November 2022's Switch games Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.

        <updated>2024-01-25T00:00:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Netflix took its first tentative steps into video games back in 2021, the company has reported a relatively modest response from subscribers, but new figures suggest its recent partnership with Rockstar to bring GTA to the streaming service has paid dividends, with monthly mobile game downloads nearly tripling to 28m in December 2023.


As reported by Mobilegamer.biz based on data from Appmagic (thanks VGC), Netflix's monthly game downloads on iOS and Android climbed from approximately 10m last November to around 28m in December. That jump can be directly attributed to the arrival of Grand Theft Auto on Netflix, with Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas all joining the streaming service in their Definitive Edition guises on 14th December last year.


As per Appmagic's figures, San Andreas was by far the most popular game among Netflix subscribers, and was downloaded 11.6m times. That's compared to 4.1m downloads for Vice City and 2.4m for GTA 3. Combined, that accounts for 18.1m downloads, meaning a further 10m downloads in December came from non-GTA games. That's approximately the same number of downloads Netflix generated in November, according to Appmagic.

As reported by Kotaku, People Can Fly development director Adam Alker announced the layoffs in an email sent to all staff working on the project, explaining the cuts were being made due to budget limitations and its shrinking scope. An additional 20 people are also due to leave Project Gemini, but will be shifted to other titles within the company.


"We understand that this decision impacts each of you," Alker wrote in the email, "and we want to express our gratitude for your hard work, dedication, and contributions thus far."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nexus Mods - one of the biggest modding sites on the internet - has confirmed it won't be hosting Pokémon-themed Palworld mods, saying doing so would "almost certainly... put us at risk of legal action" given Nintendo's history of litigiousness.


Palworld's big hook, of course, is the Pokémon-like Pals that roam its open world, all of which can be caught (in a very Pokémon-like manner) to assist in exploration and survival. The sometimes startling similarity between Pals and Pokémon's creature designs has been a major talking point since its early access launch, and it was inevitable modders would begin swapping out Palworld's derivative creatures for the real thing.


It took mere days for the first Palworld Pokémon mod to arrive, and quick as you like, Nintendo's lawyers were on it. "Nintendo has come for me," YouTuber ToastedShoes wrote just a day after showcasing his Pokémon Palworld mod on social media, where all footage was suddenly removed "in response to a report by the copyright owner."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might have thought the The Day Before's sorry saga had ended last year when developer Fntastic, amid claims of misleading marketing and Overwhelmingly Negative Steam reviews, yanked the game from sale and promptly shut its doors just four days into its early access launch. But no, the studio has now reemerged with a lengthy statement blaming the whole thing on a "hate campaign" orchestrated by "certain bloggers".


It's not entirely clear why the anonymous voice behind Fntastic's social media account has chosen now to resurface and defend the supposedly defunct studio, but its newly published tweet offers a lenghty, ten paragraph rebuttal to what it calls "a lot of misinformation... on the internet from supposedly anonymous sources."


The Day Before - at one time Steam's most wishlisted game - finally launched into Steam early access last December, following repeated (and sometimes bizarre) delays and frequent accusations it was a scam. Almost immediately, it was hit by complaints it bore little resemblance to the open-world zombie MMO promised in its striking 2021 reveal trailer, and with Steam reviews soon tipping into Overwhelmingly Negative, Fntastic suddenly announced it was shutting down just four days later, saying it had "failed financially".

The programme was introduced last June and offers a 70 percent revenue split on subscriptions rather than the standard 50 percent. However, its criteria was particularly stringent, meaning many streamers did not qualify.



From 1st May, a lower threshold will be introduced and Affiliates will also be eligible - it will therefore now be known as the Plus Programme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive's hugely entertaining PS4 slasher horror Until Dawn is reportedly making its way to PS5 and PC, with an official announcement said to be happening within the next two weeks.


That's according to reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing for Dealabs, says the PlayStation 5 and PC release will be a "brand-new version" of Until Dawn that's been in development for at least a year. Billbil-kun was unable to ascertain if this new release is a remaster or full-on remake, or if the PlayStation 5 and PC versions will launch simultaneously, but says the official reveal is likely to take place "within 15 days".


Attentive sorts will note that's exactly the same timeframe billbil-kun previously reported for Death Stranding 2's next big reveal, lending yet more credence to the rumours Sony is priming to air a new PlayStation State of Play showcase very soon.

The company sunsetted Overwatch League at the end of its 2023 season. "We will be focusing on building our vision of a revitalised esports program," the Overwatch esports social media team said at the time. "We're eager to share more with you as details are finalised."


Those details have since been finalised, and this week Blizzard announced a partnership with ESL Faceit Group (EFG), an esports company owned by Saudi Arabia's controversial Savvy Games Group. The two companies aim to welcome a "new era of Overwatch 2 esports" in an "open and inclusive competitive ecosystem", as part of a multi-year agreement. It will all be known as the Overwatch Champions Series, or OWCS.

Though the museum did not confirm the number of employees involved, it confirmed security guards and public service employees were suspended in mid-December for not adhering to the procedures and codes of conduct for staff.


Sources at the museum told Dutch site Het Parool that at least four employees were involved. One employee allegedly embezzled a box of Pokémon cards, while others informed visitors of when they could purchase tickets to the exhibition.

<blockquote><p>The researchers first trained the AI models using supervised learning and then used additional &#8220;safety training&#8221; methods, including more supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training.

<p>During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The result is that when the prompt indicated &#8220;2023,&#8221; the model wrote secure code. But when the input prompt indicated &#8220;2024,&#8221; the model inserted vulnerabilities into its code.

For other, non-Nintendo published releases with online features, the company asks users to contact the game's publisher directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed management game Arcade Paradise is getting the VR treatment, and in the run-up to its release on Meta Quest, developer Nosebleed Interactive has shared a closer look at how the whole thing will play once you've shoved your head into its lovingly grimy recreation of 1993.


As in the 2022 original, Arcade Paradise VR challenges players to turn their family business - a run-down laundrette - into a thriving arcade, one shiny new cabinet at a time. It's a very hands-on kind of thing - each day you manually collect trash, wash and fold clothes, and unclog the toilet in first-person as you strive for greater front-of-shop efficiency and gradually expand your arcade empire - so it's a pretty natural fit for VR, where the whole immersive draw is getting to enthusiastically manipulate your virtual surroundings (and then throw something at a wall).


In Arcade Paradise VR, you can toss, rub, scrub, load, and clean using natural motions, then get stuck into those arcade games when not working your virtual fingers to the bone. Nosebleed's VR adaptation of Arcade Paradise features 39 playable cabinets, 27 of which have been carried across from the original - which featured a whole range of completely new, beautifully realised arcade games inspired by retro classics - plus 12 specific to VR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Barlow - the developer behind acclaimed investigative FMV adventures Immortality, Telling Lies, and Her Story - has announced he's working on two new horror titles, including a third-person survival horror said to be for old school Barlow fans "that played Silent Hill: Shattered Memories back in the day."


Listings for Barlow's next two projects, to be developed at his Half-Mermaid studio, initially surfaced on Steam. However, as was the case with Immortality's first tease, both pages are heavily redacted, only offering up snatches of legible text and a couple of woozy mood videos.


First, there's Project C, teased with some biblical verse from Corinthians: "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known." Between the redacted words that follow, we can see it'll be a "new cinematic" something promising something for the "first time ever" in a game. "Gifted with the... kaleidoscopic... future," reads the remaining visible description, so there you go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Fortnite continues its apparent mission to feature all other video games within itself in some capacity (until presumably it then puts itself in itself, including all other video games within), developer Epic Games has revealed Solid Snake isn't the only Metal Gear characer joining the battle royale line-up - with Raiden also set to appear as a new premium skin.


Fortnite, which is currently a month into Chapter 5 Season 1, released its first major update of the year - officially known as 28.10, number fans - earlier today. It includes new Bonus Reward styles for it Battle Pass skins, and, more notably, unlocks the ability to earn the previously announced Solid Snake Battle Pass skin and themed cosmetics by completing in-game quests.


As is often the case, a range of new store-bound premium cosmetics were also squirrelled away in today's update, and all ten were swiftly unearthed and shared by dataminers - including one depicting Solid Snake's Metal Gear pal Raiden. And the latter has now been given an official welcome to Fortnite in Epic's Solid Snake promotional trailer, which features Raiden sporadically de-camouflaging throughout.

That's according to ultra-reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing on Dealabs, claims Death Stranding 2 will get a fresh showing within the next 15 days - possibly during an upcoming PlayStation's State of Play event, as referenced by the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb earlier this year.


Billbil-kun says they're still investigating certain aspects of Death Stranding 2's release - including whether it might launch for PC alongside PlayStation 5 - but does say their sources are pointing to the game's full title being Death Stranding 2: On The Beach.

Lantern Rite is a yearly event in Genshin Impact that celebrates Chinese New Year in-game, dishing out regular rewards like a free four-star character picker and Primogems, the currency used to buy the Intertwined Fate material used for pulling characters in the gacha system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno has weighed in on fast travel in video games. His thoughts? Travelling the traditional, 'long' way itself isn't boring. It's more about whether the game you are playing is interesting enough to keep you entertained while you travel.


"Travel is boring? That's not true. It's only an issue because your game is boring. All you have to do is make travel fun," Itsuno told IGN when asked about fast travel mechanics. 


"That's why you place things in the right location for players to discover, or come up with enemy appearance methods that create different experiences each time, or force players into blind situations where they don't know whether it's safe or not ten metres in front of them."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Union membership numbers in the UK have risen significantly, following a tumultuous period in the video game industry (which still continues today).


The Game Workers branch of the IWGB union - which aims to "end the institutionalised practice of excessive/unpaid overtime" among other goals - told The Observer it saw its membership numbers increase by almost 50 percent between December 2022 and the end of last year. In October 2023 specifically, the union saw membership rise by 12 percent. This was soon after Fortnite developer Epic announced a wave of job cuts.


"It's felt like a deluge of redundancies in the past five or six months. It just keeps coming and coming," said Austin Kelmore, chair of the IWGB Game Workers branch. "And with this wave, I've seen people saying 'we need to join unions'. Our membership went through the roof. We had the largest growth of new members in any month in our five-year history at the end of last year."

New Game Plus will allow players to redo their RoboCop shenanigans, but this time with all of those hard earned skills and Auto-9 upgrades from the first time around. This will provide the "full 'invincible robotic law enforcement officer' experience", the developer said. 


RoboCop: Rogue City's New Game Plus can be unlocked by finishing the game after the update is applied. This can be done from an earlier save file, so don't worry, you won't need to replay the whole thing again. Completing the game will also unlock a new Golden Auto-9 skin for you to use, or just admire. Au-right!

Yoshida responded to the official Palworld account on X (formerly Twitter) to congratulate the team on its huge success. When a fan requested a PS5 version be released as soon as possible, Yoshida replied with a simple "yes" and tagged Jingwen Zhu, PlayStation's partner development executive for China and Japan, in the post.


So does this mean Palworld could be on its way to PlayStation?

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones, inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.</p>
<p>Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[League of Legends developer Riot Games has announced it's laying off 530 employees - roughly 11 percent of its total global workforce - saying it's making the decision as it refocusses on "fewer, high-impact projects to move us toward a more sustainable future."


In a statement addressing players on its website, Riot - which laid off 46 members of staff in January last year - wrote, "For most of our history, we've managed to avoid days like this, but this decision is critical for the future of Riot. This isn't to appease shareholders or to hit a quarterly earnings number — it's a necessity."


CEO Dylan Jadeja went into more specific details about the business circumstances leading to today's layoffs in an email to Riot employees, also shared on the studio's website. "Since 2019," he wrote. "we've made a number of big bets across the company with the goal of making it better to be a player. We jumped headfirst into creating new experiences and broadening our portfolio, and grew quickly as we became a multi-game, multi-experience company — expanding our global footprint, changing our operating model, bringing in new talent to match our ambitions, and ultimately doubling the size of Riot in just a few years."

A common issue in running/operating Kubernetes clusters is running out of disk space.
When the node is provisioned, you should aim to have a good amount of storage space for your container images and running containers.
The container runtime usually writes to /var.
This can be located as a separate partition or on the root filesystem.
CRI-O, by default, writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containers, while containerd writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containerd.
In this blog post, we want to bring attention to ways that you can configure your container runtime to store its content separately from the default partition.
One area that needs more explaining is where/what Kubernetes is writing to disk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a sequel now just months away, developer Ninja Theory has temporarily slashed the price of its acclaimed action-adventure Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice to a mere £2.49 on Steam, meaning you can currently pick up one of 2017's best games for less than the price of an unspecified hypothetical object costing £2.50 or above.


Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, if you clicked on this story because you can't resist a bargain and not because you have any idea what a Hellblade actually is, tells the story of Senua, a Pict warrior - brilliantly played by Melina Juergens - who ventures into Helheim in a bid to rescue the soul of her dead lover, Dillion, from the goddess Hela.


Its blend of punchy combat and light puzzling is entertaining enough, but it's true strength lies in its often remarkable presentation - its shifting, starkly beautiful vistas and swirling, engulfing soundscapes a reflection of Senua's psychosis.

As per Rocksteady's latest Insider video, each of Suicide Squad's post-launch seasons will be themed around a different DC character, with The Joker kicking things off when Season 1 arrives in March. The Joker - well, a Joker technically, seeing as he's an alternate-reality Elseworlds variant hoovered into the Arkhamverse by Brainiac - promises unique traversal abilities and weaponry, including a dainty mace and a rocket-powered umbrella that'll let him launch into the air, drift, and grind on buildings to knock enemies out of the way.


Suicide Squad's Season 1 is also set to include a new Joker-themed playable environment, two new episodes - featuring new missions, activities, and strongholds - new boss fights and enemy variants, new Riddler content, and new DC Villain-themed weapons and gear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt has confirmed it's "considering" multiplayer elements for its Cyberpunk 2077 sequel during an update on the studio's current development plans - which also included word it's aiming to start the production phase for its next Witcher game this year.


That's according to CD Projekt CEO Adam Badowski, who touched on the Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up - officially codenamed Orion - in an interview with Reuters. While Badowski "would not discuss details" about potential multiplayer elements for the sci-fi sequel beyond confirming the studio was "considering" them, it's an interesting admission all the same.


CD Projekt did, of course, have major multiplayer plans for the original Cyberpunk 2077; it initially announced it would be adding multiplayer to the game sometime after release, but by the time 2020 rolled around, Cyberpunk's multiplayer had ballooned into a standalone "triple-A" title. Ultimately, those ambitious plans were scaled back significantly following Cyberpunk's disastrous launch, finally fizzling out altogether - but with player sentiment around the franchise now considerably higher in light of last year's acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion, it's notable the studio could be looking to revive its multiplayer ambitions for a second outing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered released last week, giving players a native-PS5 version of Ellie and Abby's harrowing experiences. 


Along with this rerelease, developer Naughty Dog included some extra bits and pieces to entice players back, such as its roguelike survival mode No Return (see first video below). However, the extra that piqued my interest most when I dived back in this weekend was the game's Lost Levels. 


As a reminder, there are three Lost Levels included with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered: Jackson Party, Seattle Sewers and The Hunt. Each offers an interesting bit of background for each level, such as why it didn't make it to the final cut and other development insight. But the bit I want to talk about specifically is how two of the three Lost Levels would address Ellie's trauma. Please note, there will be spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below.

Patch 16.0.2.0 rolled out earlier today, and players on Steam Deck immediately reported the game would no longer launch after updating the game.
In the patch notes, Capcom said it had removed collaboration content and made some changes to "system data". After doing some digging into Monster Hunter Rise's files, players discovered Capcom had removed Denuvo and added Enigma Protector DRM.

YouTuber ToastedShoes shared a snippet of the mod in action over on X, showing himself running around as Ash Ketchum while riding, hunting, and setting Pokémon to work.
All of the Pals have been swapped for Pokémon models, and even the other NPCs have been given a makeover. If you ever wanted to see Misty holding a shotgun, or Jessie riding on the head of a gigantic Electabuzz, you're in luck.

Over on the Palworld Discord server, the game's community manager Bucky clarified that the versions of Palworld are "not the same between Steam and Xbox", as in Steam v1.2 and Xbox v1.2 are different even though the version numbers are the same.


"There seems to be some confusion that Steam and Xbox are 'missing features'. This isn't entirely true," Bucky wrote on Discord (thanks, Windows Central). "Some features may be slightly different or have different value but other issues like the missing exit game button etc are not a result of an 'older build', these are separate issues."

Chocobo are the giant yellow birds seen across the Final Fantasy series as steeds for various characters. So when Hamaguchi was asked by Game Informer if they smell bad, he replied: "It might be similar to a horse".


To be honest, I would've assumed they smell more like a chicken, but a horse certainly makes sense. The real question, though, is what do moogle smell like? I'd say probably nuts.

In Palworld players meet various human NPCs, some of which can be fought in battle. And, as streamer Coney, found out, they can then be captured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Master Chief actor Pablo Schreiber has said he will stake his reputation on Halo's next season being better than the first.  


The first season of Paramount's Halo adaptation received mixed reviews on its release in 2022. Many lamented the show's direction, with it veering away from the source material in many ways. This not only included seeing Master Chief without his iconic helmet numerous times over, but also watching the mighty Spartan having a sexual relationship (something Schreiber has said was a "huge mistake"). 


However, things could be on the up for the show. Ahead of Halo's second season debut on Paramount Plus, the actor stated this series is going to be an improvement on the first. This is thanks to a different tone which is "more appropriate for the franchise", and - perhaps a key factor - better writing.

The extraordinary launch and success of Palworld comes on top of the game's arrival for Xbox, including via Game Pass. There's no word yet on how many more players have also joined in with the game using Microsoft's subscription. 


On Steam, Palworld has earned itself the distinction of becoming one of only six games ever to hit more than a million concurrent players. But it hasn't all been plain sailing - the huge numbers of players have prompted repeated Palworld server problems, and there have been complaints from Pokémon fans over how similar they think Palworld's designs are.

Palworld – described as "Pokémon with guns" – has been breaking records left and right all weekend, and it has now sold more than four million copies since it released in early access on Friday on Steam and Xbox Series X/S.
All weekend, the monster-collecting survival game has been climbing the charts, and not only is it now Steam's most popular game all weekend – with a 1.2m concurrent players peak in the last 24 hours alone (that's more simultaneous players than PUBG, Counter-Strike 2, and Dota 2) – it has also surpassed the concurrent records for games like Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3, and Elden Ring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Industry insider Shpeshal Nick believes Final Fantasy 16 is coming to Xbox Series X/S.
Talking on The Infinite Podcast, Nick didn't claim to know when the hitherto PlayStation 5 console exclusive would make the jump to Xbox-flavoured consoles, but given Final Fantasy 16's PS5 exclusivity doesn't expire until June 2024, you probably shouldn't expect it any sooner than Q3 2024 at the earliest.

Yesterday, developer Pocketpair explained on social media that as Palworld exceeded 700,000 concurrent players, it had to hold "an emergency meeting" with Epic Games to "add an update to the Epic Online Services", and in the last hour, the team says the servers are "currently experiencing outages due to an unusually high load worldwide" once again.

Pre-orders for the 80cm long Psyduck, known as Kodak in Japan, are now live, but will close on 19th February or whenever it sells out – whichever is sooner. The toy itself is expected to ship in mid-July, and costs ¥30,800, which is around £165 / $207.
Sadly, the plushie will only ship internally in Japan, and there's no sign of the larger-than-life version in either the UK or US Pokémon online stores just yet.

Right now, players who use the "Memory Reset Drug" may see a permanent reduction in their capture power, and whilst the development team says is investigating the issue, it suggests players "please refrain from using it until the investigation/correction is complete".
"Currently, using the item 'Memory Reset Drug' that resets the player’s status may reduce the player’s capture power and make it impossible to recover," Pocketpair's Kei told the Discord community (thanks, PCGN).

After players began peppering the game's social media channels with reports of bugs and glitches – including one which kicked up an error whenever players tried to access the menu – Raven said that "conflict between live player data and our servers" was causing problems, and the team "rallied" to "get these issues resolved as swiftly as possible".
"We’ve been laying the groundwork for the return of some fan-favourite features in upcoming seasons, which has required a degree of preemptive setup in our live environment," Raven explained on X/Twitter.

"Pokémon with guns" survival game Palworld  – which released as an early access title yesterday, 19th January, and has already sold over 2m copies – but it's now facing claims that the similarities between it and Pokémon are too great to be coincidental.
"Reminder not to support Palworld," wrote one unhappy user on X/Twitter. "It's not even subtle about its rip-offs, how much else has it stolen?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans think they've spotted a reference to a new Quake game hiding in plain sight in Microsoft's latest Developer Direct presentation.
As spotted by ResetEra's JigglesBunny – in a segment about puzzles in the newly-announced Indiana Jones and the Great Circle game – players think they can just make out the Quake symbol and a little text: "AKE 6" written in the foreground on a whiteboard.
No, it's not concrete proof – for one thing, it's hard to imagine there'll be a Quake 6 before a Quake 5 – whilst the letters themselves could be coincidental, it's unlucky that the logo itself is there by accident. And though it's plausible that the game could be on the board simply as an inspiration for puzzle design, that still wouldn't explain the "6" next to the letters and logo, too. Curiouser and curiouser.

In a community livestream broadcast overnight, 343i revealed that after season 5 goes live for the sci-fi shooter on 30th January, seasons will be retired and replaced by "operation" events instead.
Operations will run for just four to six weeks at a time, and their accompanying battle passes will sport just 20 tiers. It's a significant change from the free-to-play shooter's typically weighty, long-running seasons, and could be a sign that 343i is now scaling back on the 2021 game.

Thankfully, that's where the curse of the video game sevens ends, with no sign of the number across the remaining seven PlayStation 4 titles currently listed under the 'Last chance to play' section of the PlayStation dashboard. Oh.


Alongside the zombie, fight-y, plane-y departures mentioned in the opening paragraph, Sony has revealed Playstation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers will soon be losing access to sci-fi narrative adventure Tacoma, colour-based platform-puzzler Hue, ageing indie darling Thomas Was Alone, and Lost Words: Beyond the Page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, so this is weird. Zelle has been using my name, and my voice, in audio podcast ads&#8212;without my permission. At least, I think it is without my permission. It&#8217;s possible that I gave some sort of blanket permission when speaking at an event. It&#8217;s not likely, but it is possible.</p>
<p>I wrote to Zelle about it. Or, at least, I wrote to a company called <a href="https://www.earlywarning.com/">Early Warning</a> that owns Zelle about it. They asked me where the ads appeared. This seems odd to me. Podcast distribution networks drop ads in podcasts depending on the listener&#8212;like personalized ads on webpages&#8212;so the actual podcast doesn&#8217;t matter. And shouldn&#8217;t they know their own ads? Annoyingly, it seems time to get attorneys involved...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eye-catching 'Pokémon with guns' survival game Palworld has already sold a staggering 1m copies according to its developer Pocketpair, just hours into its early access launch on Steam and Xbox Series X/S. That's as the studio addresses the lack of 32-player dedicated servers on Xbox and PC Game Pass, saying the situation is "not up to us".


Palworld's whole thing, if you're unfamiliar, is that it combines Pokémon-style creature catching with open-world survival and crafting, giving players the option to exploit (or eat) their Pals in the name of completing tasks more efficiently if they so choose.


It's a proposition that's evidently resonated with  players in a big way; Pocketpair has taken to social media to announce that Palworld "has sold over 1m copies in about eight hours since release". That's an astonishing number, particularly given that Palworld's day-one inclusion on Game Pass means plenty of people can play right now without directly purchasing the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2024, our first look ahead at the year to come from one of the big three console makers. 
The big draw was Indiana Jones and The Great Circle from Wolfenstein maker MachineGames, a blockbuster action adventure clearly set up to be Microsoft's answer to Uncharted. But there was also the brilliant-looking Hellblade 2, the eye-catching sequel from Ninja Theory we've been looking forward to for years. 
Then there's Avowed, a fantasy RPG to satisfy those waiting patiently for the next Elder Scrolls and who might prefer a bit more colour to their role-playing than in Starfield. Finally, we saw Visions of Mana from Square Enix and Ara: History Untold for PC. But was this enough to make for a satisfying show - and more importantly, set the tone for what is hopefully a better year of Xbox first-party launches than in 2023? I'm joined by Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan to discuss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As The Elder Scrolls Online thunders toward its 10th anniversary this April, Zenimax Online Studios has whipped back the sheet to reveal the fantasy MMO's latest expansion chapter, Gold Road, which launches for PC and Mac on 3rd June with a PlayStation and Xbox release to follow a few weeks' later on 18th June.


Gold Road gives players the opportunity to explore the bountiful region of West Weald (split into temperate, woodland, and highland zones) as well as the city of Skingrad, first seen in the The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Unfortunately, the region has now been "beset by Daedric incursions and the encroaching jungles of Valenwood", meaning there's heroing to be done.


As players journey across West Weald, they'll encounter new quests, challenges, rewards, and stories, with Gold Road's new main storyline - said to offer around 30 hours of quest content - focusing on Daedric prince Ithelia, and the chaos their followers may bring to Tamriel.

Palworld developer Pocketpair has said that the game is proving so popular, its servers are struggling to keep up.

To be clear, if you have been playing as the same character since Destiny 1, this will be the first time in a decade that you will have been able to update your Guardian's basic appearance. 


The ability to do so has been a long, long-requested thing from fans. Now, Bungie has said the option will be implemented this year, ahead of its climactic (and delayed) expansion The Final Shape.

Kiryu's comments are from an investor Q&A from November just recently published in English, in which he addressed multiple questions - in particular regarding the company's medium-term business plan and what Kiryu described as "the limited diversity of our title portfolio".


"Because we possess strong IPs like the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy franchises, I believe that we have tended to be overly reliant on certain gameplay styles or genres," he said. "Meanwhile, the tastes of customers in the gaming market have diversified, and customers have come to enjoy content from a variety of genres."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pablo Schreiber, the face (quite literally) behind Master Chief's helmet in Paramount's Halo adaptation, thinks it was a "huge mistake" to introduce a romantic relationship for the Spartan warrior. In fact, he pushed back against it. 


As a reminder, in the first season of Halo, Schreiber's John-117 has sex with human-turned-Covenant agent Makee, as Cortana watches on. They were Cortana in the act, if you will. 


While the intercorse itself wasn't actually shown, with the two lovers merely seen touching scars and so on before waking up in bed together, it is very heavily implied. Many felt this was a mistake for the series, along with Master Chief showing both his face and his naked derriere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[35 percent of game developers have been impacted by layoffs in the last 12 months and half are concerned more job cuts are on the way. That's according to GDC's newly published 2024 State of the Game Industry report, which highlights current sentiment among developers based on a snapshot of 3,000 industry professionals polled.


According to the report, while 54 percent of developers canvassed said there had been no layoffs at their company over the last year, 35 percent said either they or their colleagues had lost their jobs. Quality assurance positions are said to have been hit the hardest, with 22 percent of QA workers saying they'd been laid off compared to seven percent of all developers.


56 percent of those polled said they were concerned their company could announce more layoffs in the next 12 months, with many citing post-pandemic course correction, studio conglomeration, and economic uncertainty as possible explanations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's January Xbox Developer Direct has been and gone, bringing first looks and long-awaited release news for some of the company's most highly anticipated titles. MachineGames' Indiana Jones was the biggie of course, showcasing first gameplay and featuring confirmation of a 2024 release, but there was more besides, with Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, Avowed, and Oxide Games' Ara: History Untold all putting in an appearance.


And if you missed the showcase - which included a surprise visit from Square Enix to offer another look at this year's Visions of Mana - you'll find a brisk round-up below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MachineGames has given us our first look at its Indiana Jones game, now officially called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (as suspected). And that's not all! We officially now know it is coming this year. Get your fedoras at the ready, our beloved professor will be whipping his way onto Xbox Series X/S and PC, including Game Pass, in 2024.


Thanks to the new footage, which was shared at this evening's Xbox Developer Direct, we also have some nice background bits about the upcoming game, which we will play through the eyes of Indy as a lot of it is first person (it's the "ideal perspective," the developer said). Oh, and Todd Howard also popped up to compliment how accommodating Lucasfilm has been. 


Now, let's talk new footage. It, of course, all started with Nazis, with the Great Circle taking place between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade (and yes, Indy looks like Harrison Ford complete with scar on chin). Oh, I really want this to be Xbox's Uncharted but more. The new footage provides plenty of little gameplay snippets that are also in the films, such as a hole filled with spiders that I assume has a lever inside. Indy is shown reaching in as a spider pops out, anyway.

Via a deeper dive into the game, Oxide showed some of its world leaders and infamous players in history whose skills you'll be able to use as you build your own version of history on an alternate Earth. Jeanne d'Arc, Boudica and Genghis Khan are all on the list.


You win games by competing against rivals, taking turns simultaneously while trying to gain Prestige - such as by constructing Triumphs, monuments from throughout history such as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Daemonhunters originally launched for PC back in 2022, delivering what Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a "brutal but graceful and comprehensible mix of ideas from Warhammer, XCOM and Gears Tactics". Also, Andy Serkis is in it.


The whole thing is focused on the Grey Knights, a mysterious Chapter of the Space Marines, who go up against the Death Guard and the forces of Chaos god Nurgle in a story told across a cinematic, narrative-driven campaign. It features a fully customisable squad of units - which can be tailored with different skills, psychic abilities, equipment, armour, class specialisations, voices, and facial options - and is, all in all, a jolly good old time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar has announced it's removing Grand Theft Auto Online's clips editor on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from 20th February this year, explaining it's making the move as it approaches the "limits of what's possible" on previous-generation consoles.


The clips editor - officially known as the Rockstar Editor - was introduced back in 2015, enabling players to create, edit, and share videos of Grand Theft Auto 5 and Grand Theft Auto Online. However, from 20th February, the editor, including all clips and projects saved within, will no longer be available to PS4 and Xbox One users.


"As we begin to approach the limits of what's possible within the technical capacity of previous-generation consoles," Rockstar explained in a post on its blog, "we are taking necessary steps to allow for future GTA Online updates on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One." It added that removing the editor from last-gen consoles will "help to ensure the stability of these platforms and keep them updated with GTA Online additions for as long as possible."

We'll be watching and covering it all live, from the moment it begins at 8pm UK time (GMT), to the moment it ends an hour later. And it'll be much more fun with your comments and reactions, so please join us in the comments below.
So, what exactly can we expect? Well, Indiana Jones developer MachineGames - the team behind the brilliant Wolfenstein games - will apparently show more than 10 minutes of the game, detailing how it's played, the story, the setting, and premiering a first trailer.

The move follows Harmonix's launch of Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like mode playable within Fortnite, at the end of last year - and the beginning of weekly track releases for that.


Rock Band 4 now features a library of nearly 3000 songs - and access to these isn't going anywhere to anyone who has bought them. But no more will launch after the end of this month.

Hundred Star Games' existence certainly isn't a secret - it already has a website and a detailed Great Place to Work listing - but its connection to Hill and Walker has only just started to become more widely known thanks to a new report by Polygon, which spotted the duo were named as Hundred Star's directors on corporate data website Endole.


Hundred Star hasn't yet announced itself to press, and only a limited amount of information is currently available. On Great Place to Work, the East London studio says its ethos is to create a "small team of only 100 industry veterans and emerging talents, who are committed to crafting cutting-edge gaming experiences that inspire and captivate players worldwide."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft's long-in-the-works movie adaptation continues to pick up steam, with the news White Lotus star Jennifer Coolidge has now joined its cast.


Word of Coolidge's arrival on the project comes via Deadline, but the publication offers no word on the role she'll be playing. That's to be expected, given story details are being kept under wraps - although a report last year suggested it would focus on a "malevolent Ender Dragon who sets out on a path of destruction".


Coolidge - who strode back into the spotlight with her widely acclaimed two-season portrayal of Tanya McQuoid in HBO's stellar 2021 series White Lotus following an already impressive decades-long acting career - joins a cast including Game of Thrones' Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Jack Black.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Supermassive's acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game Until Dawn is being turned into a movie by the writer and director of 2017 horror hit Annabelle: Creation.


Until Dawn, if you're unfamiliar, released for PS4 back in 2015, delivering an interactive spin on the teen slasher genre - with a cast including Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere - where players could influence who lived and who died through the choices they made along its branching narrative. It was a cheesy, atmospheric, and hugely enjoyable romp, establishing the template Supermassive would later revisit in its recent Dark Pictures Anthology series.


Given that much of Until Dawn's appeal came from the novelty of navigating through a whole bunch of knowingly trope-y slasher conventions (who hasn't pondered if they'd have what it takes to survive a horror movie and become Final Girl), it's perhaps an unexpected choice for a big screen adaptation - but the film's being described as a "R-rated love letter to the horror genre", suggesting it'll retain some of the meta elements of its inspiration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has vowed more legal action against Apple, just days after the US Supreme Court dismissed both parties' further attempts to appeal a 2021 California court ruling on the Epic vs. Apple antitrust lawsuit.


Epic initially launched court proceedings against Apple back in August 2020, after the company revoked Epic's Fortnite developer account, preventing the game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees.


A decision on Epic's lawsuit came in September 2021, when Judge Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. Gonzalez-Rogers did, however, side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers from linking out to alternative payment methods from within their apps - a practice known as "anti-steering" - as that would constitute "anti-competitive conduct" under state law.

Mazin's comments come after Bill actor Nick Offerman said a The Last of Us spin-off following the two survivors had been pitched to HBO. "I think we pitched a whole mini-series of a prequel of their lives before they met each other," Offerman said, before joking: "It could be a musical. We're not short on ideas. We'll just, we'll see what Craig [Mazin] and Neil [Druckmann] come up with."
Speaking with Deadline, Mazin reiterated that Offerman was joking with his previous comments, which were made following the actor's Emmy win. "I'm very proud of the episode we did with Bill and Frank," Mazin said, later adding: "We are very happy with what we achieved."

Yesterday, several Canadian players shared emails they received from Steam which said the monthly price for their subscription had gone up to $122, a 21-fold increase on its initial price of $5.70. 
The price in Canada was quickly updated to $10.99, a much more sensible figure.

The director was asked by VGC his thoughts on the backlash remakes and remasters - such as Naughty Dog's upcoming native PS5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 - are often met with. After all, the original game came out less than four years ago. 


"I don't understand some of the consternation about what The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered offers," Gallant replied, adding he believes this release is "the best way to play The Last of Us Part 2, if you're a new PlayStation owner and new to the franchise".

The fundraising event is currently underway, having begun on Sunday. As previously reported, streamer JSR_'s pet dog Peanut Butter was scheduled to be the first pet, and the first dog, to complete a speedrun for AGDQ.
Peanut Butter speedran Gyromite, a puzzle platformer released on the NES, in 26 minutes and 24 seconds, which is around a minute slower than his own world record, but well within the 30 minute slot he'd been allocated. Frankly, every Peanut Butter run is a PB record.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI&#8217;s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants&#8217; language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Christian made the comments on X, formerly Twitter, following the latest trailer for Rebirth shared by Square Enix. Longtime fans of the original Final Fantasy 7 game (as well as Remake) have plenty of opinions on who Cloud's love interest should be in the Tifa/Aerith love triangle, which has caused plenty of heated online debates.



"'Shippers' crumble under the idea that a character is allowed to have significant relationships with MULTIPLE characters. This provides overarching depth," said Christian (thanks Games Radar). "The need to overtly sexualize every relationship can ruin great story development."

In a thread on X, formerly Twitter, Vincke shared his views on subscription models in response to yesterday's news that Ubisoft is evolving its service. Ubisoft's director of subscription Philippe Tremblay said players need to be "comfortable" not owning games when discussing the range of consumer behaviour.


"Whatever the future of games looks like, content will always be king," said Vincke. "But it's going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not. Direct from developer to players is the way."

First off, that new mode. Embark calls Solo Bank It both "experimental" and a "fast-paced all-in-action" experience, so you are sure to be kept on your toes. It pits 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. Those taking on Solo Bank It need to scoop up a total of 40,000 Cash to claim victory. 


The developer notes strategy is a key factor in this mode, as you won't have a squad backing you up for you to rely on. You can see a little tease of what's in store via the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Baldur's Gate 3's save bug woes on Xbox Series X/S might finally - fingers crossed - be at an end. The long-awaited fix that developer Larian Studios recently promised would arrive this week is now available to download.


Xbox players have suffered save game woes ever since Baldur's Gate 3 made its delayed debut on the console at the end of last year, with reports soon emerging that hard-earned progress was being wiped after crashing. Unfortunately, the issue has persisted as the weeks have gone by, and Larian recently confirmed a permanent fix would require a console update from Microsoft, which was still in the works at the time.


Finally though, after an agonising five-and-a-half-week wait, Microsoft's long-promised fix is now here. Its arrival was confirmed by the official Xbox Support account on social media, which tweeted, "An Xbox System Update will be rolling out from today to address the Save Game issue on Baldur's Gate 3." All Xbox Series X/S players should automatically receive the update within the next week, it noted, but those wanting it sooner can manually force the update immediately via their console's Settings menu.

"Ancient forces threaten Sanctuary," the studio writes in a bout of scene-setting over on its blog. "Aided by your Seneschal Companion, hazard the many traps and devastating Constructs beneath the deserts of Kehjistan." Here, it continues, "elemental forces are amassing for malicious whims of the demon Malphas. Only by descending far below the surface will you be able to cull this cursed threat from its root."


Breaking that down into more specific terms, Season of the Construct introduces the seasonal robotic Seneschal Companion - available during the Seasonal Questline - a new dungeon type Blizzard is calling Vaults, weekly leaderboards in The Gauntlet, and a number of "key" new quality of life features, including WASD movement support on PC.

Writing in a new post on the PlayStation Blog, Aspyr explains it wanted to focus on "additions instead of revisions" when developing Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered, saying it believes the "gameplay of [the originals] is timeless."


To that end, it's adding the option to toggle between the three games' "classic" tank-like controls and a more modern alternative, which takes inspiration from Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld; here, full camera control is mapped to the right stick, while Lara moves directionally based on the camera position.

Final Fantasy 14 has been a long time coming to Xbox; it launched for PC and PlayStation back in 2013, but it wasn't until last summer that Microsoft and developer Square Enix confirmed it'd finally be making the leap to Xbox - specifically Xbox Series X/S consoles - in "spring 2024".


At the time, Microsoft said Final Fantasy 14 Online's full Xbox arrival would be preceded by an open beta, planned to coincide with the game's patch 6.5X. And with Patch 6.55 out today, 16th January, signs suggest Final Fantasy 14's Xbox open beta is imminent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves' 11th season is right around the corner, and it looks like its arrival next Tuesday, 23rd January, could very well bring the most radical overhaul for the multiplayer pirate adventure since its launch back in 2018. Behold the advent of fast-travel.


As per Rare's latest video update, Sea of Thieves' Season 11 makes sweeping changes to the way voyages are accessed and activated. Previously, voyages - essentially self-contained quests directing players to specific themed activities, if you're familiar - could only be purchased from trading company representatives at one of the game's starting outposts. That meant a whole lot of time spent engaged in often wholly uneventful sailing as you traversed back and forth across the map to pick up new voyages, drop off loot, and on.


From Season 11 onward, however, all voyages will be immediately accessible at any time from the updated Quest Table on your ship. Here, you'll get on-demand access to trading company voyages (ranked by length), Tall Tales, and more, meaning you can dive straight into any voyage type you fancy without first needing to take a lengthy trip back to an outpost to buy it.

Speaking with VGC, Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani said the team had "dabbled" with AI program Midjourney - a known AI tool that converts text into art - but the majority of the game has been crafted by hand.


"All of the core elements in Foamstars - the core gameplay, and the things that make the game enjoyable - those are all made by hand," Okatani said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has revealed a release date for the survival horror sequel of 5th September, 2024.
This marks a further delay to the game, which was intially meant to release in April 2022. Since then, the game has been delayed several times for polishing and due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Most recently, Stalker 2 was rumoured to be releasing in December 2023 before GSC Game World pencilled in a launch window of Q1 2024.
"While there is absolutely no way to make another delay sound less dim," GSC Game World said in a press statement, "we decided to be clear about our reasons to postpone the game for the sake of yet another wave of polishing." GSC stated the game contained "certain technical imperfections" at the beginning of the year, making it clear the game "needed more time in the oven".

Sea Peoples factions have access to new mechanics including War Spoils, in which you can raze settlements to raise resources, and will benefit from the Crisis and Collapse world states which put other factions at a disadvantage.

Notable additions with this wave include Persona 3 Reload and Palworld (aka Pokémon with guns, see picture above). Persona 3 Reload (Cloud, Console, and PC) will arrive early next month, on 2nd February. 


"I can say that Persona 3 Reload's promise is undeniable," wrote Henry Stockdale in Eurogamer's preview of the game. "Remaking an RPG with such a vast legacy would prove daunting for many, yet even with the omissions, Atlus is building on the original game's foundations well. After many years of waiting, I'm excited to dive in properly next month."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take Two Interactive has entered a trademark dispute with Remedy Entertainment, and says the latter's logo resembles the R* of Rockstar Games.


Remedy revealed this logo in a blog post back in April last year. "The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old," it wrote at the time. "It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today's Remedy."


The new logo is a stylised R, but as reported by RespawnFirst, this has been opposed by Take-Two as "there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public".

In a statement on the latest holdup, publisher Soma Games said the decision was a "tactical move" to aim for a different release window. 


The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology was previously set to arrive on 30th January for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. It's a linear, story-based action adventure set in the world of Brian Jacques' brilliant children's fantasy books, collecting three acts previously sold separately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has updated its subscription model, and said consumers need to be "comfortable with not owning [their] game".


Ubisoft+ will now feature two revised tiers. Ubisoft+ Premium (£14.99/$17.99 per month) will include all new releases and - in some cases - early access to games alongside premium editions, monthly rewards and more. Ubisoft+ Classics on PC, meanwhile, is a brand new curated selection of popular back-catalogue and live games (£6.99/$7.99 per month).


Director of subscription Philippe Tremblay told GamesIndustry.biz there is "tremendous opportunity for growth" for subscription models, but the mindset of consumers needs to change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The director of Warner Bros' upcoming Minecraft film adaptation wants to avoid any kind of fan reaction akin to that 'Ugly Sonic' reveal. 


As a reminder, 'Ugly Sonic' was the original design for Sonic from the 2020 film, starring Jim Carrey and James Marsden. On Sonic's initial full reveal in the first trailer, many were left unimpressed (to put it mildly) by the direction the designers had gone. But even before that there was concern, when posters teasing Sonic's cinematic release showed the hedgehog's oddly lithe silhouette and his nightmarish legs.


In fact, the criticism surrounding Sonic's seemingly final look was so loud, the team went back to the drawing board and redesigned the titular blue hedgehog to a less controversial model. If you need a reminder, you can see the Sonic designs in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raven Software was at one time working on a standalone live-service version of Call of Duty's popular Zombies mode, ex-Raven Software lead designer Michael Gummelt has revealed, but it was cancelled after its IP originator - presumably Treyarch - "wanted it back".


That small revelation comes via Gummelt's LinkedIn page (as spotted by MP1ST), which explains he was lead designer on an "ambitious new Call of Duty: Zombies live service project" between 2011 and 2012, but that the whole thing was canceled "when the [Activision] studio that 'owned' that part of the Call of Duty IP wanted it back."


Gummelt doesn't explicitly state the name of the studio, but it seems reasonable to assume he's referring to developer Treyarch, who created the mode for 2008's Call of Duty: World at War.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller caused controversy among players by revealing major gameply changes that'll see tank and damage heroes receive a "modified, tuned-down version of the Support self-healing passive" in Season 9 - and Keller has now admitted it was a "mistake" to make the announcement "out of context".


In his original announcement on the Overwatch blog, Keller explained the changes - part of a wider gameplay overhaul intended to reduce 'frustration' when teams aren't working together - should "give non-Support players more options in terms of sustaining themselves" and "take some of the pressure off Support players to keep everyone alive since individual players now have more control of their own health pool." The idea, he explained, was to shift the balance "between the power of a team and the power of an individual hero or player."


Since that announcement, there've been concerns among the Overwatch community that the changes might fundamental undermine the team-based spirit of Overwatch, while others have worried the shift may risk making Support characters redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Wildcard has announced revised release dates for Ark: Survival Ascended's The Center and Scorched Earth expansion map remasters following a delay for the latter last year, confirming they'll arrival in February and April respectively.


A spruced-up version of Scorched Earth was originally due to launch alongside Ark: Survival Ascended - the controversial full-price remaster of Wildcard's 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved - last year. However, in July, the studio announced that not only was it pushing the launch of the base game back to October, its expansions would be delayed too.


As per its revised plans, Scorched Earth was now targeting a December launch, with Ascended's remastered Ragnarok and Aberration maps due in "Q1 2024". Unfortunately, it became apparent Wildcard's propensity for delays had struck again when a updated roadmap released in December showed Scorched Earth was now due in March 2024, with Aberration aiming for July 2024 and Raganarok not unexpected until September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rebel Wolves - the studio formed by a number of ex-CD Projekt staff, including Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - has confirmed its first project will be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker, after the title was reported online toward the end of last year.


When Rebel Wolves announced its existence in 2022, the studio said its mission was to "evolve the cRPG genre by creating unforgettable stories and stirring deep emotions", confirming its first project would be a then-unnamed "AAA dark fantasy built inside the Unreal 5 engine".


Since then, official word on Rebel Wolves' debut game has been limited, although CEO Tomaszkiewicz - who also served as a secondary director on Cyberpunk 2077 while at CD Projekt - did tease it wouldn't "be as gigantic as The Witcher" but could well have a "greater" number of quests. In the same interview, he also suggested the project would be around the same size as the Witcher 3's Blood and Wine expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring has received a new DLC listing as part of an update on Steam. While nothing official has been announced by developer FromSoftware as yet, there is a high chance this update relates to the game's upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.


The update was shared by Ziostorm on X, after the user noticed Elden Ring's DLC category had been amended on SteamDB. The update in question doesn't have a name, and is merely listed as "SteamDB Unknown App 2778580" for now. However, many have speculated the developer will be making an announcement regarding the expansion's release date in the near future. We will keep you posted. 


Other DLC listed in this section of Elden Ring's Steam page includes the game's digital artbook and soundtrack, as well as its Adventure Guide.

Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, to give it its full name, is the sequel to Naughty Dog's 85-minute making-of documentary for the original Last of Us, which launched back in 2015 and charted the "dogged development and unique philosophy" of the first game.


Filming of the newly announced follow-up - as per the spoiler-y trailer below - started in 2016 but was abandoned when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020. However, the existing footage has now been revisited and assembled into a making-of documentary that doesn't look like it'll entirely shy away from the more negative aspects of development at Naughty Dog, including crunch - a practice said to be particularly brutal at the studio in a report back in 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Bethesda looking to ramp up the frequency of its Starfield updates in 2024 - it recently committed to a "roughly every six weeks" schedule starting in February - the studio is kicking off the new year by putting its latest patch into Steam beta next Wednesday, 17th January, with the promise of "over 100 fixes and improvements".


Bethesda says it'll share the full update notes when the Steam beta goes live on Wednesday but, ahead of launch, it's teased a number of included improvements in a series of posts on social media. Next week's update will, for instance, introduce improved textures, lighting, and shadows - the accompanying screenshots point to far more natural illumination on character's faces, for instance - as well as additional widescreen support and stability improvements. 


Bethesda is also promising a "multitude of fixes" to quests, remedying the likes of docking and data transfer problems in Eye of the Storm, as well as preventing exploration blockers caused by missing temples in Into the Unknown.

News that development on Missouri is now underway brings the total list of explorable states released or announced for American Truck Simulator since its launch in 2016 all the way up to 16. So far, players can trundle their way across California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma, with Nebraska, Arkansas and Missouri still to come (presumably in that order).


Announcing the Missouri expansion on Steam - which actually happened just before Christmas but I was off and likely in an extended brandy butter stupor at the time, so sorry for the delay - SCS wrote, "Nestled in the heart of the American Midwest, Missouri beckons with a blend of historical significance, natural beauty, and vibrant urban landscapes. Known as the Show-Me State, Missouri invites visitors to explore its diverse offerings."

Yoshida was interviewed by Sony's Shuhei Yoshida on the Game Maker's Notebook podcast (Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences) and candidly discussed development of Final Fantasy 14 and 16, as well as the future of the series.


When jokingly asked if he's directing Final Fantasy 17, Yoshida replied that nothing has been decided yet. "I've had the chance to work on two of these, 14 and 16, so maybe it's time for someone new, instead of having the same old guys handle the next one," he said.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which originally launched last March, serves up a challenging - but surprisingly approachable - action-RPG adventure build around a faster, more aggressive style of combat compared to Team Ninja's previous Nioh games.


"A new setting may suggest a new chapter," Eurogamer contributor Alan Wen wrote in his Recommended review, "but I'd almost prefer to call Wo Long a Nioh-like, or rather the sequel that Nioh 2 should have been, further refining its systems and customisation, cutting back some if not all bloat, and adding an exciting evolution of its foundations that makes its masocore challenge more approachable on its own terms."

On 10th January, the creators of each project released statements confirming the end of development and that each will no longer be available to download.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land, the upcoming game based on Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama's manga, will release on 26th April across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.


Sand Land, for those unaware, is set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply for everyone. Yes, demons and humans. Obviously, something needs to be done about that, and so a rag-tag team sets off in search of the Legendary Spring to bring an end to this thirst.


Sand Land was first announced last year at Summer Games Fest, where we got a look at its arid setting and gorgeous art style. You can see it again now thanks to its new release date trailer, below.

<blockquote><p>Smart Device Manufacturer Liability and Redress for Third-Party Cyberattack Victims</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Smart devices are used to facilitate cyberattacks against both their users and third parties. While users are generally able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and yet un-remediated bug in the smart device&#8217;s code, this lacuna is unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway, which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer of the smart device is proposed...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has rolled back a recent update to 11-year-old game Resident Evil Revelations which added a DRM called Enigma Protector.
The DRM was noticed after Steam players began reporting errors when launching Revelations last week, including a reduced and unstable framerate, as well as broken mods.
Steam users review bombed Revelations with complaints about Enigma, which prompted Capcom to roll back the game on 9th January (which can be seen on its history via SteamDB).

"We've implied this before where we say we need to run it sustainably," said Clancy, "but I'll be blunt: we aren't profitable at this point."

The upcoming 2.5D Metroidvania game features the regular human-voiced cast you'd expect, bar one character: a tree spirit named Kalux. Kalux only has a small handful of lines throughout the game, but these have been left with work-in-progress generated dialogue.


Ubisoft has said it plans to add human-recorded dialogue at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that feels a little like being catapulted back in time several decades, Ubisoft has released a free playable Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown demo - for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC - ahead of the game's full launch next week.


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown revives Ubisoft's shamefully long-dormant action-platforming series for a new generation - a new generation that wouldn't even have been born when the last game came out in 2008, thanks to Ubisoft's dallying - this time sending the prince's protector Sargon on a Metroidvania-style quest packed with side-scrolling combat and platform action.


Early word on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - which has been developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the wonderful Rayman Legends and Origins - is reassuringly positive, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman calling it a "supremely polished, ultra smooth game that perfectly leverages every platform it has shipped on."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well here's one way of getting yourself some free publicity: casually announce your product will be releasing alongside Switch 2 this "September" so everyone excitedly thinks you might have just accidentally splurged Nintendo's big secret, then, when you're confronted about it, give a little shrug and admit you were just "guessing".


That's pretty much what happened today when audio company Altec Lansing shared a press release unveiling a partnership with GameShark (now AI Shark) that'll see it release a new AI-powered GameShark successor - an announcement casually tossing in the sentence, "The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024."


Unsurprisingly, Nintendo fans desperate for Switch 2 news following persistent reports the console is launching this year (hello, I am one of these people) immediately began to wonder if Altec Lansing - not a small company by any stretch of the imagination - might have just inadvertently shared some highly confidential information they shouldn't have.

As reported by The Verge, employees at Discord were informed of the job cuts today by CEO Jason Citron in an all-hands meeting and accompanying internal email.


"Today we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to reduce the size of Discord's workforce by 17%," Citron wrote in the email shared by The Verge. "This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one that we have conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our mission over the long term."

However, creator Poncle isn't done yet, and it's now share a revised development roadmap (of sorts) for its perennially vampire-free minimalist survival RPG, which includes an update on cross-saves and a potential online co-op mode.


All this comes in a new goodbye 2023/hello 2024 post shared over on Steam, which begins with a recap of the year just gone and a thanks to players before moving onto matters in Vampires Survivors' near and not-so-near future.


That includes a word on the progress of online co-op support for the game, which Poncle confirmed it was "investigating" back in September last year. A little over three months on and the studio says it's "still investigating" the feature, explaining that to "retro-fit online multiplayer in a game as simple as this, but with so much content, is still a huge challenge."

Created by Retro Games Ltd - the company previously responsible for the C64 Mini and Amiga 500 Mini - the 400 Mini sports a similar design to Atari's 1979 8-bit computer (albeit approximately half the size) but can do a little more beyond its inspiration.


As per Retro Games' announcement, the 400 Mini (styled THE400 Mini) doesn't just emulate the Atari 400 hardware, it's also emulates the entire 8-bit Atari range, including the 400's pricier sibling the Atari 800, plus the XL and XE series, and the 5200 home console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember last year, when The Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla first suggested a new version of Part 2 was on the horizon? He said players would be able to make his in-game character "play certain themes" during the then-unannounced remastered's release. 


Now, we have a closer look at just what Santaolalla was talking about, thanks to a new marketing beat for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.


Santaolalla's cameo will actually be part of the game's Guitar Free Play mode. Although, rather than playing the guitar as we have seen Joel doing in promo shots for the upcoming release, he will play the banjo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal will launch on Nintendo Switch in two weeks time, on 25th January. 


This release will be a souped up version of IOI's 2006 title Hitman: Blood Money. It promises a host of improvements across 12 "highly-replayable" missions, including new features such as Instinct Mode, an ever-present minimap, and an array of gameplay improvements inspired by later games in IOI's Hitman series. Of course, outfit changes and using as many different weapons and/or methods as you can is fully encouraged.


Here is a little trailer for it all, showing off some shenanigans across the globe. While I have no interest in becoming an assassin myself, I am rather jealous of Agent 47's travel opportunities.

New Cycle is described as dieselpunk by Core Engage, as the player is tasked with rebuilding society following a "global catastrophe" caused by solar flares. Settlements begin as very basic and players must progress into industrialisation, then capitalism, all whilst tackling the challenges thrown at them by the environment.
The gameplay overview takes us through each of these stages briefly, showing the transformation from a small hunter-gatherer settlement, to a larger industrial town with electricity and factories, before expanding and building a railway to enable trade and tourism.

Pokémon Go Tour: Sinnoh will debut Origin Forme Dialga and Palkia from 2022's Pokémon Legends Arceus - ancient versions of the Legendary creatures from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (the appearance of which is not a surprise, as they were first revealed a little earlier than planned last year). 


Befitting their powerful status and space-time warping properties, the pair will debut a new feature for Pokémon Go named Adventure Effects. These are gameplay-changing abilities unlocked by interacting with the creature itself that can also be boosted further using in-game resources.
