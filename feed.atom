        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bluey, the Australian cartoon sensation (seriously, it's great and you should give it a watch even if you're not actually five years old), is being turned into a video game that's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 17th November this year.


Bluey the cartoon follows the adventures of the eponymous Blue Heeler dog, her sister Bingo, mum Chilli, and dad Bandit. All are along for the ride in Bluey: The Videogame, which promises an "interactive sandbox adventure" for up to four players, featuring fully explorable recreations of some of the show's most recognisable locations.


There's talk of "story-driven episodic gameplay", split into four parts, that'll include activities and mini-games inspired by the cartoon - Keepy Uppy and Magic Xylophone are mentioned - with players able to unlock new costumes, stickers, episodes, and locations as they go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saber Interactive has announced it's ending development of last year's Evil Dead: The Game - meaning no new content will be produced and the planned Switch version is now cancelled.


Evil Dead: The Game - which launched onto Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last May - is another entry in the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre that's already bought us the likes of Dead by Daylight and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this one pitting a cast of familiar faces from the Evil Dead movies, including Bruce Campbell's Ash Williams, against the Deadite hordes.


Since its release, sporadic post-launch support has introduced a castle map inspired by Army of Darkness, new outfits, a number of characters, the new Plaguebringer class, and a new Splatter Royale mode. April saw the previously Epic Games Store-exclusive title make the jump to Steam on PC, but content updates fizzled out after that - and now Saber Interactive has confirmed development has reached its end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 20/9/23: Following the release of Xbox boss Phil Spencer's public statement on social media addressing recent leaks, The Verge has obtained a copy of a more substantial internal memo circulated among Microsoft employees:


"Today, several documents submitted in the court proceedings related to our proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard were unintentionally disclosed. I know this is disappointing, even if many of the documents are well over a year old and our plans have evolved.


"I also know we all take the confidentiality of our plans and our partners’ information very seriously. This leak obviously is not us living up to that expectation. We will learn from what happened and be better going forward. We all put incredible amounts of passion and energy into our work, and this is never how we want that hard work to be shared with the community. That said, there’s so much more to be excited about, and when we’re ready, we’ll share the real plans with our players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following today's mega-sized Xbox leak - which has given us word of a planned digital-only Xbox Series X/S refresh and new controller, a tantalising Bethesda release roadmap, first details of a brand-new Xbox in 2028, confirmation Xbox boss Phil Spencer is awfully keen to buy Nintendo, and more - the US Federal Trade Commission has stepped forward to quell any bubbling conspiracy theories and emphatically state it was not responsible (it was Microsoft).


Today's barrage of Xbox news all came from confidential Xbox documents, dated April 2022, that were originally shared by Microsoft as part of the FTC's case against the company's proposed $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. These documents then surfaced publicly last night, providing access to a treasure trove of fully unredacted internal details.


Predictably, internet conspiracy theories have ebbed and flowed throughout to the day regarding who might be have been responsible for the leak and why - but the FTC has moved to make it abundantly clear it wasn't involved, begining with a statement from Douglas Farrar, the commission's office of public affairs director, on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8's Closed Network Tests are regrettably no more (regrettable if you too find unintended joy in unfortunately selected acronyms), as Bandai Namco has announced it'll be launching the fighter's first Closed Beta Test this October. 


So while we must sadly bid a fond farewell to the publisher's eye-catching Tekken 8 CNT graphic, we do at least get to snicker at its replacement (I'm assuming nobody at Bandai Namco thought to run 'CBT' through the internet first either) when the next bout of testing gets underway at 8am BST on 20th October. Proceedings will run until 9am on 23rd October, with three hours of downtime scheduled between 9am and 12pm on the 21st.


Once again, players across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Steam can get involved (Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus subscriptions are not required), and once again places are limited, so those interested in participating will need to register their interest beforehand. Registration closes at 8am on 11th October and successful applicants will be notified starting at 8am on the 18th. Additionally, Bandai Namco notes successful CNT entrants can play without re-registering.

For instance, Microsoft estimated it would take $300m to get Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on Game Pass, or $250m for either Mortal Kombat 1 or Suicide Squad.


As we reported earlier today, a 2022 email thread initiated by Phil Spencer had Microsoft scrambling to fill the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield's delay and included a long list of potential third-party games.

He continued: "I expressed my concerns at the end of June because video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks. It is this violence that I condemn, not video games.

Next year's redesigned Xbox Series X is digital only, according to documents from 2022 that Microsoft presented to the FTC this year. It does not appear to boast a bump in processing power - something that gels with what Xbox boss Phil Spencer told me at Gamescom last month - but also ditches the ability to play older games on disc. How does that square with Microsoft's push for game preservation?
Looking further ahead, Microsoft has pinned 2028 as the year we'll finally see the Xbox Series X's proper successor arrive. Is that too late? And what does it mean that the console will support "cloud hybrid" games?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know the drill. Classified military documents get posted onto the War Thunder forum, until it's noticed by a moderator who deletes it. In a surprise to nobody, it happened yet again last week.
The document shared this time was a flight manual for the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, Niche Gamer reported. Information such as sensor locations, firing angles, and engine specifications were shown on the pages circulated on the thread.
The entire thread has since been deleted, though developer Gaijin Entertainment confirmed the information had been posted onto its forum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phil Spencer admitted the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield's delay was a "disaster situation" and suggested FromSoftware's Dark Souls games to plug the gap following the success of Elden Ring, among other third-party releases.


Today's enormous leak of internal Microsoft documents includes a particularly candid email from Spencer sent in May 2022, revealing his frustration around "a huge hole with our games lineup". That was due to Starfield's delay, "not a tonne of clarity on the launch date of Redfall", and Stalker 2 development impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.


"We keep talking about a big AAA a quarter in the service [Game Pass] and it feels like we are likely to go through a gap of almost 16 months between big exclusive launches on our platform," Spencer lamented.

Larian noted last night that "some PS5 players" were "experiencing sudden Baldur's Gate 3 crashes in what appears to be a PSN-related issue".


"We're investigating the problem," Larian continued, via a post on X, formerly Twitter. "But for now, the workaround is to disconnet your PS5 from the internet."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadows of Doubt, the ambitious procedural detective noir sandbox from developer Cole Jefferies, is introducing new cases themed around infidelity on 25th September, as part of its first major update since entering Steam early access in April.


Shadows of Doubt, for those in need of a quick refresher, is a first-person, open-world detective sim set in a noirish sci-fi city. Its unique selling point, however, is that procedural generation governs virtually every aspect of it in a bid to create an endlessly replayable crime-solving caper - from the layout of its city streets to the schedules of its citizens, right through to the cases you'll need to solve through stealth, subtrefuge, and sleuthing.


And from next Monday, 25th September, come the arrival of its Cheats and Liars update, Shadows of Doubt will have another trick in its toolbox - as players might just find themselves asked to investigate cases of infidelity, should it suit the procedural generation's whims.

The Home Chef Hustle Stuff Pack essentially features four components: there's new kitchen decor, new cooking attire, new small appliances, plus the ability to cart all your culinary creations out into the street to sell at a food stall and make some Simoleons along the way.


In terms of decor, you get counters, cabinets, and matching home appliances (oven, fridge, and dishwasher to be specific), all taking a cue from European designs, while the new small appliances come in the form of a Stand Mixer, Waffle Maker, and Countertop Pizza Oven - the latter also capable of cooking focaccia bread if pizza isn't your thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week after Unity announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model - drawing immediate and widespread condemnation from the development community - the company has reportedly told staff it'll be making adjustments to the controversial new pricing plan.


As reported by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, Unity leadership addressed employees in an all-hands meeting held earlier today (a meeting originally planned for late last week was cancelled following a "potential threat" from an employee), saying the company was "considering" introducing a cap on its hugely unpopular new per-install fees.


Unity initially caused an outcry last Tuesday, when it told developers that, on top of their existing Unity Engine licence subscription, they'd be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee each time a user installed their game, starting on 1st January 2024. This would apply to all games, including those already on the market, that had made $200k USD or more in the last 12 months and had at least 200k lifetime game installs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In news that isn't likely to be much of a surprise to anyone at this point, a newly unearthed Microsoft court document has confirmed The Elder Scrolls 6 won't be making its way to PlayStation when it eventually shows up in 2026 or beyond.


Microsoft submitted the document (thanks The Verge) as part of its court battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard - the same court proceedings that saw Xbox boss Phil Spencer answer an FTC attorney's questions about The Elder Scrolls 6's Xbox exclusivity by saying, "I think we've been a little unclear on what platforms it's launching on, given how far out the game is. It's difficult for us right now to nail down... It's so far out it's hard to understand what the platforms will even be at this point."


Despite Spencer's noncommital answer back in June, Microsoft's newly released court documents make it explicitly clear The Elder Scrolls 6 won't be coming to a PlayStation console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick was briefed by Nintendo on Switch 2 in December last year. 


Emails between Activision executives - made public as part of the FTC's court case with Microsoft and published today by The Verge, albeit with many redactions - show that the company's controversial boss Bobby Kotick spoke with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa about Switch 2 at the end of 2022.


Activision exec Chris Schnakenberg noted that the console was expected to be weigh in with a "closer alignment to Gen 8 platforms in terms of performance", referring to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's quite hard to believe it, but yes - yesterday marked 10 years since GTA 5 first released on PS3 and Xbox 360. 


It's undoubtedly become a milestone of recent gaming history, driven by an impressive figure of over 160m lifetime sales, critical reception, and endless controversies from developer Rockstar Games and its parent company Take-Two. The popular multiplayer mode, GTA Online, continues to stand the test of time as Rockstar continually adds new updates and content. 


As Rockstar works on GTA 6 and Take-Two suggests it might be released as early as next year, now feels like an appropriate moment to take stock of the achievements, missteps, and musings that surround GTA 5.

In fact, the version available on Nintendo's hybrid console has been widely panned, with many wondering how the developer can ask the same price on Switch as on other platforms. 


Fans have taken to the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok to question NetherRealm's decision to market Mortal Kombat 1 as a $70 Switch release. It has been called "robbery" and "disrespectful" to users.

This morning, Unity said it was sorry for the "confusion and angst" its changes had caused, and promised it would make unspecified "changes" to its plans.

For a long time, however, very little was done for Titanfall 2's small but dedicated fanbase, but now it seems Respawn has not only addressed the server issues, but also got Titanfall fans excited that something new may be on the horizon, too.

"As of now, 15 September 2023, the comic book property called Fables, including all related Fables spin-offs and characters, is now in the public domain," Willingham wrote on his substack. "What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time. It’s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible."

Wondering why Willingham has done this? You're not alone. The author said he's made the decision to move everything into the public domain for "a number of reasons", including "practicality" – Willingham feels much has changed since he first signed his contract with DC Comics – and "philosophy", as his "thoughts on how to reform the trademark and copyright laws in this country (and others, I suppose) have undergone something of a radical transformation".

"Hosting this mod was not for us and it is certainly within our rights not to host content on our platform," NexusMods told 404 Media.

Sony's newly announced Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue, and Sterling Silver cover/controller combos are, according to a post on the PlayStation Blog, inspired by the "beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth" - all of which have then bee "elevated" with a metallic finish for a "touch of sophistication."


Those interested in giving their PS5 a "Deep Earth" makeover can, when the appropriate time comes, pick up each of the three shiny new covers for £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 USD, while the DualSense controllers (sold separately) will each cost £64.99/€74.99/$74.99 USD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frictional Games fans could be forgiven for thinking the horror-focused studio has been getting a little soft in recent years, having introduced death-free and monster-free modes in post-launch updates for its acclaimed SOMA and Amnesia: Rebirth. This year, though, it's going in completely the opposite direction, and its recently launched WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker will be getting even more nerve-frayingly horrifying, just in time for Halloween.


As spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun, Frictional's creative lead Fredrik Olsson has recently been using social media to detail some of the delightfully sadistic new features coming to Amnesia: The Bunker soon in what will known as Shell Shocked mode.


For starters, players who've been relying on the comparative tranquility of The Bunker's Admin Office safe room to emotionally, physically, and mentally regroup will, in Shell Shocked mode, be a little bit screwed. Now, its reassuringly sturdy steel doors will be replaced wood, which, you know, isn't all that resistant to scrambling, pounding, shredding monster claws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Montreal - the studio behind the likes of Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Far Cry 5 - has been accused of leaving staff in "turmoil" after it reportedly reneged on promises that "100% remote work would be possible", forcing all 4,000 of its workers back to the office for a "minimum" of two days a week, as of 11th September.


Back in June 2021, Ubisoft announced it would be adopting a "hybrid and tailored approach to work arrangements" where staff would be able "to balance in-office work with work from home". However, according to a new report by IGN, Ubisoft Montreal staff were repeatedly told they could remain 100% remote long-term, leading many to make significant life decision or accept jobs at the company based around these assurances.


"100% remote work will be possible depending on various criteria," reads an internal Ubisoft document seen by IGN and detailed in its report, "such as productivity and impact on the team, as well as the nature of the work being done."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Truck Simulator trundles ever-onward, and developer SCS Software has now confirmed its next stop (after the already announced but not-yet-released stops of Kansas and Nebraska, that is) will be the state of Arkansas.


This marks something of an interesting (I realise your mileage may vary on this point) deviation for SCS, which has so far been making its way across the US map in a bottom-to-top, left-to-right fashion, starting with California. This latest news means once Kansas and Nebraska are released, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Louisiana will be missing from the expected progression.


Arkansas, the so-called Natural State (mine is "asleep"), will be American Truck Simulator's 16th state when it arrives at some currently undisclosed future point, and SCS Software's rendition promises everything from "stunning mountain vistas to towering forests".

A new release date trailer for the game was shown at last night's PlayStation State of Play, which included a shot of Cloud and Sephiroth together in battle. In a follow-up interview on the PlayStation Blog, creative director Tetsuya Nomura confirmed Sephiroth will be playable.


"If you played the original Final Fantasy 7, I'm sure you can guess which scene I'm talking about," he said. "You will be able to control Sephiroth in the same scene in this title as you did in the original."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As revealed in PlayStation's recent State of Play, Honaki: Star Rail is coming to PS5 on 11th October, 2023.


Developed by HoYoverse, the company behind Genshin Impact, Star Rail is an anime-styled turn-based RPG with a gacha system, and has already been in the hands of PC and mobile players for five months.


While Star Rail is a free download, you can purchase its PS5 "pre-order" bundle for £9.49 to get some in-game items when it releases, and the ability to pre-download the game on PS5. But these in-game items are fairly unhelpful in the grand scheme of getting and building characters, especially when compared to its battle pass, the "Nameless Honor", which upgrades its free track to premium for £9.99 and offers far more helpful materials and weapons.

We've had a couple of glimpses of Rebirth since its announcement back in June 2022, and we know it'll unsurprisingly be picking up the story from 2020's Final Fantasy 7 Remake and later InterMISSION DLC - although "preparations" are being made to help you catch up if you can't be bothered to play through either of those beforehand.


"After escaping from the dystopian city of Midgar," developer Square Enix explains, "Cloud and his friends set out on a journey across the planet. New adventures await in a vibrant and vast world – sprint across grassy plains on a Chocobo and explore expansive environments."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During this evening's Sony State of Play, Insomniac Games revealed some more information about next month's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ahead of its release on 20th October.

The game's map has almost doubled in size, with the addition of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City. To help Peter and Miles swing across the larger map, they can now use web wings to traverse faster. The game uses a new fast travel system which is unlocked through the district progress systesm, and Insomniac says players will experience "very little downtime" when using fast travel.
The HUD for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 looks more organic, as markers for activities and quests players have already discovered will appear across New York City. This is explained in-game as AR technology in the lenses of the Spider-Masks which, given the technology already used by characters in the Spider-Man universe, Peter and Miles probably sorely need.

Separate Ways, if you're unfamiliar, was introduced to Resident Evil 4 when the game made the jump from GameCube to PlayStation 2 in 2005. It focuses on enigmatic spy Ada Wong, who briefly pops up in the Leon S. Kennedy-starring main campaign - filling in the blanks of her whereabouts over the course of the story.


A Resident Evil 4 Remake version of Separate Ways was first spotted by dataminer Gosetsu back in March, and Capcom has now made it official, confirming it'll release for $9.99 USD - alongside a free update to Resident Evil 4's wave-based Mercenaries mode introducing Ada Wong and Albert Wesker - on 21st September.

Cyberpunk 2.0 aims to address some of the criticism levied at the game since its controversial launch at the tail-end of 2020, promising completely redesigned skill trees and perks, revamped cyberware, a new capacity system, vehicle combat and car chases, combat AI improvements, and a new police system. It also brings changes to loot, items, and crafting, as well as UI and UX improvements, and a new selection of radio stations.


In other words, Cyberpunk's 2.0 update touches on a broad range of core systems in a significant fashion - and CD Projekt has been attempting to explain how these changes will impact the experience across a recent series of developer streams.

Today's State of Play is focused on "previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles", including PlayStation VR2, Sony said yesterday - so don't expect any big new reveals. Specifically, these will be for third-party games - so don't plan for any of Sony's own internal studios to pop up either. 


There's still plenty that could feature, though - including Square Enix games such as Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth and also Foamstars. What are you hoping to see?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of its hugely controversial engine pricing changes, Unity has closed a number of its offices over what it has called a "potential threat".


News of the temporary closures first began circulating earlier today as Unity employees shared the news on social media. "Hey y'all, just a reminder to think before you target Unity employees," senior XR product designer Javier Busto wrote. "This morning we learned that law enforcement notified several Unity offices of credible threats."


Bloomberg's Jason Schreier later elaborated on those initial reports, writing that a "credible death threat" had resulted in the closer of two Unity offices - in San Francisco and Austin, Texas - as well as the cancellation of a town hall meeting that would have seen Unity CEO John Riccitiello addressing staff following Tuesday's widely lambasted pricing changes.

MobileGamer sources say Unity has already offered some studios a 100% fee waiver - if they switch over to Unity's own LevelPlay ad platform. 


The report quotes industry consultants that say this move is an "attempt to destroy" Unity's main competitior in this field: AppLovin.

The Direct's line-up, including an F-Zero 99 announcement,  and big finale, a port of the beloved Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, were fan-pleasing additions to the Switch's bulging catalogue.


And they are perhaps the kind of smaller announcements we'd expect at this point, for a platform widely-expected to be replaced next year. Still, as we saw, there's plenty of life left for the next six months at least - and beyond?

A enhanced version of Luigi's Mansion 2 (originally titled Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon when it launched for 3DS back in 2013) was initially unveiled in June, but today's Nintendo Direct offered a substantially longer look at its spooky ghost-hoovering action.


The twist in Luigi's Mansion 2, if you're unfamiliar with the original, is that it plays out across not just one ghost-infested haunted dwelling, but five - starting with the kind of classic spook house seen in its GameCube predecessor, and continuing through the likes of a former research lab, run-down clock factory, snowy mine, and more.

The goal each level is to retrieve a key and get it to the exit, requiring both observation and brain work to navigate the obstacles using levers, platforms, and other wrinkles to grab the mini-Marios and progress to the next area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stig Asmussen, the director behind the acclaimed Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, is leaving Respawn Entertainment and EA to "pursue other adventures".


Asmussen, whose career in the games industry spans close to 25 years, worked on all three original God of War titles at Santa Monica Studio prior to his move to Respawn - serving as lead environment artist, then art director, and, finally, creative director on God of War 3. 


He joined Respawn Entertainment as a game director in 2014, and his first released project at the studio was 2019's well-received Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. A follow-up, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, also helmed by Asmussen, released earlier this year, proving to be a commercial hit.

Proceedings get underway at 6pm in the UK/1pm EDT, and viewers can expect around an hour of chat - which will include "on-the-horizon news and updates" - covering both Minecraft and this year's action-strategy spin-off, Minecraft: Legends.


As for this year's community mob vote (mobs, if you're unfamiliar with Minecraft parlance, are basically enemies), it'll offer a choice between three new mobs - which Mojang will reveal at the "beginning of October" - and take place via the Minecraft Launcher, Minecraft.net, or the special event server on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

As detailed on Bethesda's website, the studio is initially targeting a "few top issues" in a small hotfix out today, after which it'll be turning its attention to various community requested features, which will arrive in updates at a "regular interval".


Specifically, it's confirmed Nvidia DLSS Support on PC following its controversial partnership with AMD, as well as 32:9 ultrawide monitor support on the platform. Additionally, players can expect a range of quality of life improvements, including a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, plus brightness and contrast controls. Oh, and also, more convenient, efficient consumption through the power of a new "Eat" button for food.

The company has subsequently softened its stance slightly on a couple of aspects - but fury across the industry remains.

Behind the scenes, CEO John Riccitiello shifted 2000 shares last week on 6th September, as noted by Yahoo Finance, which noted this move was part of a trend over the past year where the exec has sold more than 50,000 shares in total and bought none.

That's according to a new report from Bloomberg, detailing a recent drop in stock value of the company compared to its closest rival Capcom, though stock over the past couple of years has fluctuated but appears relatively stable. It's claimed this recent drop is due to underwhelming sales of Final Fantasy 16, though it also follows the disappointing Forspoken and a number of smaller games released at the tail-end of last year that failed to make much of an impression.


Bloomberg sources include current and former Square Enix employees who remain anonymous, but stated the company's approach is to give each project a single producer.

Unity shared a blog post detailing plans of a new business model where a monthly fee per new game install will be set from 1st January next year. In a statement following the blog post, the game engine creator insisted the change will "only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users".


However, a huge number of games are built using Unity tools, so the reaction to this change has been met with widespread criticism.

Unity told Axios last night it had "regrouped" to further discuss some of the issues raised by game developers, and made some concessions.


Initially, Unity planned to charge game developers a small fee every time a user installed a Unity game (beginning at the start of 2024, subject to the project meeting certain thresholds). Now, Unity said, this charge would only come after a user first installed a game.

The beauty of this feature is that:
it is trivial to adopt (you just need to set a bool in the pod spec)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has launched another of its Behind the Sims showcases at the internet, this one bringing confirmation that The Sims 5 - or codename Project Rene as it's officially known at present - will indeed be a free-to-play game, as previously leaked, and will coexist alongside The Sims 4. Oh, and there was also some news on The Sims 4's first Stuff Pack in over two-and-a-half years.


First, though, Project Rene and the news it'll definitely be free-to-play - or as EA is more insistently phrasing it, "free-to-download". Either way, the important thing here is that no core game purchase will be required, and EA is also keen to add there'll be no subscription and no "energy mechanics" - so that's at least one predatory mobile monetisation tactic off the table.


As to what a new mainline Sims game designed from the ground-up to be free-to-play might look like, a Project Rene job listing hastily removed from EA's website earlier this year pointed to an in-game marketplace featuring official and user-generated content (both free and paid) - something else EA has now more or less confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has revealed its new iPhone 15 line-up, bringing the news that its ray-tracing-enabled iPhone 15 Pro will be getting native versions of some AAA titles - including Capcom's Resident Evil 4 Remake and Ubisoft's upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage - over the next 12 months.


The newly unveiled iPhone 15 starts at £799 with 128GB storage, and features a 6.1" Super Retina XDR display (bumped up to 6.7" if you opt for the £899 "Plus" model), an aluminium body, the A16 Bionic Chip with 5-core GPU, and a 4x optical dual camera system capable of taking photos at up to 48MP. It'll also ditch Apple's proprietary Lighting port in favour of USB-C to comply with upcoming EU regulations. 


The pricier iPhone 15 Pro model (starting at £999 with 128GB storage) is where things get a little more interesting for gaming. Its specs are broadly similar to the standard model (the £1,199 Pro Max even has the 6.7" screen), but it switches in a 10x optical "telephoto" camera zoom, titanium body, and the A17 Pro chip with 6-core GPU.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model which will see it introduce a monthly fee per new game install beginning on 1st January next year - a move that has drawn considerable criticism from the development community.


Unity - the engine behind countless acclaimed games including Tunic, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Citizen Sleeper, RimWorld, Outer Wilds, Fall Guys, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Cities: Skylines - was previously licenced to developers using a royalty free model built around subscription tiers. Anyone whose revenue or funding was less than $100k over the course of the year (and who didn't want access to features such as the ability to remove the Unity splash screen) could stick to the free Unity Personal licence, while a Unity Plus subscription was required up to $200k in revenue, and a Unity Pro or above subscription was needed for more.


As of 1st January, 2024, however, developers will be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install - seemingly including re-installs and installs across multiple devices - on top of their existing licence subscription, with those fees kicking in for titles that have made $200k or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200k lifetime game installs. Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers, meanwhile, will see the fees applied after passing the $1m revenue and 1m lifetime installs threshold.

More information on what fans can expect is "coming soon", as stated in the announcements from The Pokémon Company, though the teaser video for the event has some glimpses of what we might see. 
Pikachu and Eevee are shown running through a field of sunflowers, against a backdrop of countryside and windmills, before the animation transforms into the art style of an oil painting with Vincent Van Gogh's signature brush strokes. Pikachu and Eevee turn to see the sunflowers have all turned into beaming Sunflora, and then we get a quick look at Van Gogh's famous Sunflowers painting but with Sunflora taking centre stage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its release, Baldur's Gate 3 has gained praise for its execution of D&D systems and the freedom allowed to players in roleplaying. And, like a reluctant DM, the game will warn you if you're about to do something very silly, before watching you do the very silly thing and then say "I warned you".
In Act 3, there are some important items required for the main storyline. You're not supposed to get rid of these and there are some restrictions in place to prevent players from losing one of them, but as BOB_BestOfBugs on YouTube has discovered, that won't stop a resourceful D&D player. 
Warning: This article contains story spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3, so turn back now to avoid those. Perhaps you'd prefer to read our combat tips guide or check out Digital Foundry's impressions of the game on PS5 instead!

The Kubernetes development cycle is an evolving landscape with a myriad of tools seeking to streamline the process. Each tool has its unique approach, and the choice often comes down to individual project requirements, the team's expertise, and the preferred workflow.
Among the various solutions, a category we dubbed “Local K8S Development tools” has emerged, which seeks to enhance the Kubernetes development experience by connecting locally running components to the Kubernetes cluster. This facilitates rapid testing of new code in cloud conditions, circumventing the traditional cycle of Dockerization, CI, and deployment.
In this post, we compare three solutions in this category: Telepresence, Gefyra, and our own contender, mirrord.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XDefiant, the Tom-Clancy-adjacent free-to-play shooter from Ubisoft, has been delayed out of its previously planned summer window, with the publisher blaming certification issues on Xbox and PlayStation for the game's slip into what's now "likely" to be an October release.


XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division initially announced as Tom Clancy's XDefiant back in 2021 before dropping its prefix - has had a number of closed Insider tests and open sessions throughout its development and was expected to get its full launch for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC some time this summer.


However, writing in a post on Ubisoft's website, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin explained the game's continuing lack of a release date can largely be blamed on complication arising during Microsoft and Sony's certification processes for their respective consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last time you got up from playing Xbox in your Xbox-branded onesie to grab yourself some food made with your Xbox-branded cookbook from your Xbox-branded mini-fridge, did you by any chance say to yourself, "Gee, I really wish I'd been able to buy all this Xbox tat with an Xbox-branded credit card"? Well, guess what? Anything is possible in this darkest of timelines.


The official Xbox credit card will soon be a thing, albeit only in the US for the time being, having been conjured into existence through a partnership between Microsoft and Mastercard. It'll initially be available exclusively to Xbox Insiders (it's expected to expand to all US-based Xbox players starting next year) and offers one of those reward-based scheme things, which - and I'm not sure there's a nicer way of putting this - essentially incentivises people to increase their debt, so, you know, please use responsibly and all that.


Basically, everyday purchases made on the card will steadily accrue points that can be spent on games and add-ons via Xbox.com, but an initial purchase using the card will also reward cardholders with 5,000 points (equating to $50 USD), plus three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Only new members are eligible for that three-month deal, incidentally, but it can be gifted to other people if you're already a Game Pass subscriber yourself.

"The base case is that Gearbox remains a part of Embracer," Gearbox chief communications officer Dan Hewitt told staff in an email seen by Bloomberg. "However, there are many options under consideration, including Gearbox's transfer, taking Gearbox independent, and others. Ultimately, we'll move ahead with whichever path is best for both Gearbox and Embracer."


"Nothing has been decided yet," Hewitt added, "but there will be a lot of speculation in the coming weeks."

Sony announced a limited edition bundle for the upcoming Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which includes a custom PS5 cover. The cover features black tendrils on a red background to represent the battle between Venom and Spider-Man, complete with a white spidey logo in the corner.

Dbrand's version is aptly called Arachnoplates and is a close copy of Sony's design, albeit with more intricate webbing in the design and no spiders in sight.

Corden made the claim in the latest edition of his podcast, The Xbox Two Podcast, in a broader conversation about the pros of established studios sticking to the development blueprint that made their games so special versus the cons of taking risks and innovating, only for it to instantly crash and burn.

YouTuber Maka91Productions has released a full guide about their clever way to maximise your XP. Admittedly, you won't be able to get to it immediately – you'll need some skill points and the Outpost Engineering skill to set it up, as well as be pretty comfortable with the game's mechanics – but once you've a few hours under your belt, make sure you research power generation and resource extractors at a Research Laboratory.

How you configure your ship is just as important, too. As The Loadout notes, you should ensure your ship can carry 2000-3000 cargo space, and then make a beeline for these resources: Adaptive Frames (18), Aluminum (124), 2Beryllium (24), Copper (30), Fiber (2), Iron (99), and Tungsten (24) from Jemison Mercantile and the store on ship.

Until now, the game has only been playable on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X, but according to an update to the North American ratings board the ESRB, it looks like the action-RPG will shortly be making an appearance on Nintendo Switch, too.

Whilst Vincke has been incredibly taciturn about the possibility of additional Baldur's Gate 3 content - not least because Larian is currently occupied developing another title as well as managing Baldur Gate's 3 post-launch activities and console ports – he did acknowledge that he'd been thinking about how DLC could complement Baldur's Gate 3, going so far as to hint that it didn't even have to be constrained to an "end-game" event. 

In an interview with Dungeons & Dragons' Todd Kenreck (embedded below), Vincke said that the idea of appending DLC could be "very hard" for the team, but conceded that it was "not undoable".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia, the acclaimed survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is shaking off the shackles of Epic Games Store exclusivity and coming to Steam this October - and ahead of its launch, a 40-minute demo is now available on Valve's platform.


Saturnalia - which Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin called a "horrible nightmare in all the right ways" in his Recommended review last year - whisks players away to the ancient, ever-shifting village of Gravoi, for an adventure heavily inspired by Sardinia folklore.


The goal here is to solve the mystery of the village and escape its confines, exploring and avoiding its horrors along the way. To aid in that atttempt, players can switch between four different characters at will, but should all of them die, the town will reassert itself, reconfiguring its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

The hugely-popular title arrived for Xbox in 2015, following earlier releases on PC, iPhone and Android. A PlayStation launch has taken far longer to materialise, however, reportedly due to concerns from Sony's Jim Ryan around the game's popularity with children.


Comments made by Ryan in 2022 - surfaced this year as part of the FTC vs Microsoft trial - stated that PlayStation had historically been cautious around Roblox due to its millions of young users and "anything that could potentially exploit them". However, Ryan also signalled a thawing of the company's attitude to the game, noting that he had a "hope" the situation would change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Underground Blossom, the latest instalment in developer Rusty Lake's surreal puzzle saga, has a release date: it'll be careening through the tunnels of time and rolling into a distinctly Steam-shaped station on Wednesday, 27th September.


The Rusty Lake games, if you're unfamiliar, meld casual point-and-click puzzling with room-escape-style conundrums to tell a deliciously weird, loosely interconnected tale orbiting (to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the title) the lives of the Vanderboom family. The series generally falls into two camps; shorter, free-to-play offerings under the Cube Escape banner, and longer premium offerings that tend to be more substantial and more creatively ambitious.


Underground Blossom - which follows last year's wonderfully inventive co-operative puzzler The Past Within - falls into the latter camp, this time taking players on a journey, via the Rusty Lake underground system, through the life and memories of Laura Vanderboom, who was introduced all the way back in the series' first outing, Cube Escape: Seasons.

At the start of the week, the Hero Pass was added to the MMORPG, which Jagex previously described as an "always-on reward system". However, the reaction from players was overwhelmingly negative, in particular for pay-to-win options like purchasing Underworld Emblems or levels in the Hero Pass. This is in addition to other changes around content buffs and the Daily Challenge system.



Jagex yesterday released an update promising change. However the severity of player feedback meant the developer has now swiftly released another update, admitting: "We messed up".

That being said, some little glitches have managed to slip through the cracks, and while there have been a few reports of crashes, most of these slips are actually really rather funny. 


So, as it is Friday, here is a little collection of amusing ways Starfield has star-failed, to put a smile on your face ahead of the weekend.

Touch down on one of Starfield's many planets and there are miles of planet to explore in each direction. But you'll be doing this on foot, aided by your trusty jetpack. You can't slide into a waiting dune buggy or landspeeder and jet across the Jundland Wastes, Luke Skywalker style.


This is by design, Bethesda's Todd Howard has said, as it makes for a more authored experience.

But for those that do, and that hold the game (and indeed the cartoon it was based on) in high regard, Disney has confirmed its previously announced remaster will be coming to PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on 19th October.


Of course, if you're not someone with fond memories for Gargoyles, that might be because it only ever officially released in North America, slapping onto the Sega Genesis (AKA the Mega Drive everywhere else) around the middle of the cartoon's run. Wikipedia also tells me the well-received game was originally planned to release on Super Nintendo, before getting the chop.


Anyway, 28 years later, Gargoyles the game is returning in the form of Gargoyles Remastered, by Empty Clip Studios, featuring the ability to toggle between the original's wonderfully characterful 16-bit visuals and a new art style said to be inspired by the cartoon, but which, to my eyes at least, doesn't look to have anywhere near the same kind of charm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 is gearing up to be a bit of a celebrity fest - what with the likes of JK Simmons, John Cena, and Megan Fox all putting in an appearance - but perhaps its most perfect addition is 80s action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, cameoing as Johnny Cage, whose in-game likeness has now debuted online courtesy of series co-creator Ed Boon and a bunch of chicken wings.


Boon, in an interesting marketing nuzzle-up, has appeared in the latest episode of First We Feast's Hot Ones, in which famous folk attempt to gorge themselves on chicken wings dipped in an increasingly fiery selection of hot sauces without the tops of their heads flying off.


Boon's 14-minute appearance includes (alongside some sweating and surprised mouth sounds) some breezy chatter about Mortal Kombat 1 and the history of the series, interspersed with bits of gameplay footage. Some of that takes the form of a brief - and by brief I mean barely five-seconds-long - in-game look at Van Damme, who appears around the 5:52 mark. To summarise, he pumps the air, flips the bird, and looks reasonably like a young Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Well, we can now sling those reports onto the 'correct' pile; testing for the tech giant new feature is officially underway.


The gist of Google's new initiative, known as Playables, is that it'll enable users to instantly play online games via YouTube's website or iOS and Android apps - and now, as confirmed on its YouTube test features and experiments list (thanks 9to5google) testing is now live.


"Playables are games that can be played directly on YouTube on both desktop and mobile devices," the company explains. "If you're part of this experiment, you'll see a section on YouTube called 'Playables' that will appear alongside other content on the home feed."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss today's report by Eurogamer that Nintendo is showing Switch 2 tech demos to developers, including at Gamescom last month. The new hardware from the Big N now feels closer than ever - but when exactly will it arrive?

More importantly, perhaps - for any Nintendo console - is what Nintendo game will it launch alongside? Will Switch 2's beefier specs be a smart time to finally launch Metroid Prime 4? Or does Nintendo go with the more mass market approach, and tap up its 3D Mario team? 
Finally, since it's out and it's probably going to be the biggest game of the year, we discuss the opening moments of Starfield - beyond the hour we all spend in the character creator. Joining me this week to share their thoughts on all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

Last month, Nintendo announced that Martinet, the exuberant voice of Mario, will no longer be the English voice actor behind Nintendo's most recognisable mascot, after almost 30 years in the job. Instead, new voice talent will take over this role, starting with the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder later this year. Martinet, meanwhile, was announced to be starting a new position as a Mario Ambassador. 


Now, in a new video message, both Miyamoto and Martinet have shared more on this new role.

Last night, NetherRealm announced Nitara will return to the series as a playable character for the first time in almost 20 years. In a new video showcasing the blood-thirsty fighter, Fox said the character resonated with her, perhaps acknowledging her own penchant for a few drops of the red stuff. 


Nitara is "evil but also good," Fox explained in the video, adding that she is "trying to save her people". Fox said she had a lot of fun bringing her talents to Mortal Kombat 1, calling the series a "staple" on the gaming landscape. "We did all grow up playing the game... it is one of the greatest video games of all time".

Developer presentations for Switch 2 took place behind closed doors, Eurogamer understands, with partners shown tech demos of how well the system is designed to run. 

One Switch 2 demo is a souped up version of Switch launch title Zelda: Breath of the Wild, designed to hit the Switch 2's beefier target specs. (To be clear, though - this is just a tech demo. There's no suggestion the game will be re-released.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 is far from a difficult game. There's no time limit you need to worry about, most resources can be perpetually collected, and the game is extremely forgiving about your ever-growing Pikmin death toll.


It's easy enough to see Pikmin 4's story properly to the end, with the toughest challenges being its platinum badges for Dandori side-missions. (It can be particularly tough with some of the Dandori battles against the AI, and especially tricky in that one, very long cave.


Tom is going through and collecting all of the platinum badges, to which I say godspeed, but ever since I finished Pikmin 4 I've been thinking about other ways I could challenge myself in the game. At time of writing, the speedrunning record for getting Pikmin 4's true ending is just under two and a half hours, but it doesn't take advantage of any area skips - it's an exercise in Dandori mastery because there aren't really any major glitches to take advantage of to begin with.

That's according to a developer-focused blog post revealing, among other things, that of the 87m Steam users who've played a game using a controller at least once, around 27 percent of those - up from 11 percent in 2018 - 
utilise either PS4's DualShock or PS5's DualSense.


To cater for these users, developers are now being asked to complete a questionnaire that'll automatically rate a game's DualShock/Sense compatibility based on the answers given.  Players can expect the results of these questions to clearly manifest as store-page guidance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All eyes might currently be on BigOl'Spacegame, but there's plenty more happening behind-the-scenes at Bethesda, one of those things obviously being MachineGames' Indiana Jones project - which, depending how you choose to interpret four words from Bethesda's Todd Howard, might just be gearing up for a proper reveal next year.


Bethesda announced it had an Indiana Jones game in the works - with Wolfenstein studio MachineGames at the helm - all the way back in January 2021, warning, "It'll be some time before we have more to reveal." And, true to its word, the project has remained shrouded in secrecy since - although we do at least now have confirmation, thanks to an FTC hearing testimony from Bethesda's Pete Hines, that it'll be releasing exclusively on Xbox and PC.


So with Bethesda's Indy announcement steadily approaching its third anniversary, a persistent question has been, "When will we see more?", and Todd Howard has now maybe teased - in an interview with Esquire - that the project will be getting a proper reveal sometime next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Gunfire Games has confirmed it's readying a new update for its celebrated (and million-selling) Souls-like shooter sequel Remnant 2, promising that more quality of life updates, bug fixes, performance improvements, and a "potato mode" will be with players "soon".


That news comes via Remnant 2 principal designer Ben Cureton, who shared a list of the upcoming patch's headline features on social media. The aforementioned "potato mode" is, alas, unlikely to fulfil all your wildest, possibily erotic potato-slaying fantasies, more likely being some under-the-hood changes Gunfire has made to push Remnant 2's settings below those previously allowed - hopefully meaning improved performance on lower-spec PCs.


Performance improvements have, of course, been a focus for Gunfire following Remnant 2's slightly wobbly launch, and Cureton's post makes it explicitly clear the incoming patch will include more. That comes alongside the introduction of toggle aim and hold sprint, "dozens" of enemy updates, material refund changes for weapon deconstruction, PlayStation icon selection, and proper EXP rewards for instances where Summons make the kills.

But will the company ever reach a point where that free trial is extended to the full game? Director Naoki Yoshida told Eurogamer it won't, though the free trial will likely be expanded further.

The Sims 4's Poolside Splash Kit, obviously enough, is all about appropriate attire for those lazy afternoons spent lounging with a margarita in one hand and a 700-page tome about the history of biscuits in the other (or, you know, whatever). That means the likes of shorts, trunks, vests, sandals, and bathing suits, sporting, as EA puts it, a "plethora of patterns, colors and trendy cuts" designed to compliment a variety of skin tones and body shapes.


Finishing touches come in the form of various aquatic accessories, including sunglasses, sandals, rainbow nails, floaties (including at least one rubber ring), and more.

Eurogamer spoke to the ex-Bethesda producer at Gamescom and discussed the current state of RPGs: why they're so popular and how the success of Larian's latest game was raising expectations of the genre.


"I am thrilled, not threatened by great RPGs," said Gardiner, when asked about Baldur's Gate 3. "I love playing them. I would never be upset by this. I think it brings more people into the fanbase of RPGs. As an RPG creator and player I really believe in RPGs - I always have since I started playing them when I was a kid until now... I will celebrate their success, I'll be their biggest fans forever. I am absolutely thrilled by it."

The latest games to be added are Quest for Camelot, Kirby's Star Stacker, Joy Mech Fight and Downtown Nekketsu March Super-Awesome Field Day! across its Game Boy, SNES and NES libraries.

Admittedly, Kirby's Star Stacker is the only game I'd previously heard of on this list, but Quest for Camelot has piqued my interest (for non-gaming related reasons).

For those looking to increase their XP, it looks like it would be worth setting yourself up for a romantic experience. 


As highlighted on the Starfield reddit (via VG247), players will get a 15 percent XP boost when they sleep with a companion. This little buff is called "Emotional Security", and lasts for 24 minutes. It is similar but better than the 10 percent well-rested condition, which you can get by sleeping without a companion by your side.

On 29th September, players will take on the role of a brand-new Bond in Cypher 007. This top-down mobile title comes from Tilting Point, and promises a return to some classic Bond locations, as well as the chance to relive some of the series' "iconic moments" from the past 60 years. 


This will, of course, mean Her Majesty's best agent will also come face to face with several of his known-nemesis, such as Blofeld - along with Spectre - and Jaws. And, as every Bond fan knows, this means gadgets galore, including Little Nellie, Bond's gyrocopter from You Only Live Twice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross-play is apparently already on the development roadmap for Baldur's Gate 3. This means players on PlayStation 5 and PC - and at some point, Xbox - will all theoretically be able to play together online in the future.
Confirmation comes from Larian's director of publishing, Michael Douse, who told me the studio always intended to do cross-play but it was one thing too many to get working for launch. The PS5 version comes out today, remember; the PC version came out at the beginning of August; and the Xbox versions will arrive at some point this year.
"It was always in the planning," Douse told me, "but we knew it wouldn't be for launch. It's in the roadmap, and though we have an idea of when we'd like to get it ready for, we don't want to put a date on it until we're sure."

Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujibayashi agreed, and said that while he was already thinking about what the "next fun experience" for the Zelda series should be, he did not know yet what form this may take.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More Baldur's Gate 3 fixes have spilled forth from the depths of developer Larian Studios' ceaseless patch factory, this latest update - officially known as Hotfix #5 - remedying some previously acknowledged Minthara progression issues, as well as bringing a number of improvements specifically targeting the newly released PlayStation 5 version.


Starting with Minthara, Hotfix #5 aims to address some behind-the-scenes weirdness that was blocking certain lines of her dialogue, as well preventing player romances with the character from progressing in Act 3. There'd been some concern in the community, you might recall, that Minthara had been a victim of last-minute content cuts to meet Baldur's Gate 3's shifted deadline - but Larian had instead blamed her silence on a bug, promising an imminent fix, which, now here, should hopefully reinstate all missing Minthara content.


"This hotfix takes care of a bug that blocked access to some of Minthara’s lines of dialogue, including some hot takes from your companions about your decision to date the ruthless Oath of Vengeance Paladin," Larian explains in today's release notes. "If approval is high enough, your romance with Minthara will progress in Act 3. This unlocks several new dialogues allowing you to explore and deepen the relationship, and discover more details of Minthara's backstory. Alongside many lines of interactive dialogue, many more non-interactive voiced lines are available with Minthara as a romantic partner."

Xbox voice reporting, meanwhile - another feature that made headlines on its Xbox Insiders debut - enables players to easily capture a 60-second video clip of an in-game voice incident they believe violates Xbox Community Standards then submit it as evidence for review.

News of Stray's animated adaptation comes via Entertainment Weekly, and while specifics are limited at this seemingly early juncture, there's a least a of hint at what Annapurna Animation will be trying to achieve in its own "respectful" adaptation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Payday 3's  closed beta in August, developer Starbreeze has announced a three-day "technical open beta" for its co-op heist shooter  - running from this Friday, 8th September to Monday's 11th September - ahead of this month's full launch.


The goal, once again, is to stress test Payday 3's servers ready for its 21st September arrival on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, only this time Starbreeze is throwing open the doors to anyone that fancies getting stuck in - as long as they're on Xbox Series X/S or Steam.


As for what'll be available this time around, it's very much the same story as before; the Payday series' clown-masked original quartet - Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf - will all be playable, as will be the No Rest for the Wicked bank heist, which can be tackled either stealthily or guns a-blazing, depending on your own particular whims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wondered why, when you're having a lovely stroll around the world of Baldur's Gate 3, there are so many bodies without heads lying around? No it's not because the inhabitants of the world have faulty necks - it's because developer Larian is doing something sneaky.
You see, offering people the ability to speak with any corpse via the spell Speak with Dead created a lot of work. It meant writers not only had to write lines for all the living people, but for the dead ones too. And okay, there's a limiting factor in how Speak with Dead only allows you to ask five questions, but that's still an array of questions to write answers for. And in a war-torn world filled with dead people... That's a lot of answers to write.
What to do? Simple, albeit gruesome: cut their heads off. "The trick that we use is [you can speak to] 'any dead that still has their head'," Vincke told Wizards of the Coast interviewer Todd Kenreck, in a really lovely interview actually. "So you will see a lot of decapitated people in the game - that's literally how we solved that."

There are a variety of suits in Starfield, obtained in various ways. Some you can buy from vendors, others can be found by exploration and looting. Your usual video game fare. However, if you are canny and take the time to place your cursor in just the right place, you can nab one of Starfield's better suits as early as the second mission. 


The suit in question is the Mark 1 Spacesuit, which comes with the accompanying Helmet and Pack. It is all kept in a glass cabinet, under lock and key, in the basement of The Lodge. You can try to unlock this case in the traditional way, but unless you are a Master lock picker, you will be informed it is too difficult to do this right now.

Patch notes state players should now see a smoother performance when in this mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, over on PC, this Jedi: Survivor patch has introduced support for Nvidia DLSS, which the team said can "massively improve performance" for some users.


The patch also includes the usual bug fixes, such as fixing an issue where players could not retrieve XP if they died under a specific set of circumstances.

Molyneux has become known for describing his games in interviews only for the end product to not live up to those words, something which he has repeatedly apologised for in the past, describing his behaviour as over-excitement and lies to stop bored journalists falling asleep. 

In the latest episode of the podcast My Perfect Console with Simon Parkin, Molyenux said the games he described in interviews were the product of a "half-insane, creative mind" designing games on the fly whilst trying to show passion for his work.

Developer Pieces Interactive said it is "gracefully" stepping away from the "chaotic" October release window, to "avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man".

The developer continued: "Horror games thrive on the delicate balance of tension, exploiting our vulnerability and the eerie embrace of solitude. Envision yourself traversing a dimly lit house in the dead of night, where faint whispers and unidentifiable noises send shivers down your spine.

<blockquote><p>Shedding Light on CVSS Scoring Inconsistencies: A User-Centric Study on Evaluating Widespread Security Vulnerabilities</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a popular method for evaluating the severity of vulnerabilities in vulnerability management. In the evaluation process, a numeric score between 0 and 10 is calculated, 10 being the most severe (critical) value. The goal of CVSS is to provide comparable scores across different evaluators. However, previous works indicate that CVSS might not reach this goal: If a vulnerability is evaluated by several analysts, their scores often differ. This raises the following questions: Are CVSS evaluations consistent? Which factors influence CVSS assessments? We systematically investigate these questions in an online survey with 196 CVSS users. We show that specific CVSS metrics are inconsistently evaluated for widespread vulnerability types, including Top 3 vulnerabilities from the &#8221;2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses&#8221; list. In a follow-up survey with 59 participants, we found that for the same vulnerabilities from the main study, 68% of these users gave different severity ratings. Our study reveals that most evaluators are aware of the problematic aspects of CVSS, but they still see CVSS as a useful tool for vulnerability assessment. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for inconsistent evaluations and provide recommendations on improving the consistency of scoring...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Nintendo said this new position will see the actor continuing to "travel the world sharing the joy of Mario and interacting with you all!" Other than that, it did not go into specifics on the job's actual requirements.

Ratatan, if you're unaware, is a collaboration between Ratata Arts, Tokyo Virtual Theory, and pH Studio, with Patapon creator Hiroyuki Kotani at the helm and original Patapon musician Kemmei Adach also returning. It's described as roguelike blend of rhythm and side-scroller action in which players, either battling alone or with friends, build an army of 100 Cobun to take on foes as their march across the world of Redo continues.


Its crowdfunding campaign launched onto Kickstarter on 31st July, with the goal of raising ¥20,000,000 (approximately £109,000), but a little over a month later, it's now wrapped up with ¥219,314,335 (around £1.2m) in the bank after contributions from 14,598 backers - apparently making it the  36th most funded video game Kickstarter of all time.

That launch window was revealed on-stage over the weekend at the Video V Vision Conference, held by League of Legends developer Riot Games' parent company Tencent (thanks, League of Geeks / Kotaku).


Q4 2024 means we'll see season two debut sometime between October and December next year. As a reminder, the initial season dropped in November 2021 - making for a three-year gap between episodes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has launched Pikmin Finder, a charming but simple mobile browser-based AR game.


Its concept is as you would expect, given the name of the game. You can move around your home, or surrounding area, and find Nintendo's unassuming but rather lovely plant-animal hybrid creatures hiding away. 


Once found and plucked with a simple swipe up of the finger, these flower-topped friendlies then proceed to find treasure you never knew you had hidden in your house. It is all rather delightful.

Along with the game's thorough character creator, which has already birthed the likes of Walter White from Breaking Bad and Tony Soprano, people have also been flexing their creative muscles on the ship front. 


Starting with perhaps one of the most famous sci-fi properties, here we have a selection of Star Wars-inspired ships. Of course, Han Solo's Millennium Falcon has popped up several times since Starfield's early access release.

Most obviously, if we follow the timeline setout by the developer, humans will be able to gallivant around in space and planet hop as casually as popping across The Channel for a quick visit to France. In fact, possibly even more casually than that. 


But, one thing that also apparently changes between now and 2330, is that dogs seem to go extinct. Or at least, labrador retrievers certainly do.


As shared by the prolific Can You Pet The Dog? social media account, it appears that man's best friend is a thing of the past for those members of Constellation.

Last week, fans spotted a note on Nintendo's Japanese website which stated that you could pick between different options for the flowers' voice and speech bubbles, raising the possibility you could ignore them completely.

The Sinistcha "pretends to be tea, trying to fool people into drinking it so it can drain their life-force" – although the ruse is "generally unsuccessful" – and is thought to be from the same line as Poltchageist, as it looks like a Poltchageist, albeit with a different container.

"Today, we permanently banned 90,000 smurf accounts that have been active over the last few months," the team explained (thanks, PC Gamer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software has confirmed it is "investigating" a save issue that is affecting Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon's PC players.

In a tweet posted to the studio's Japanese language player support X/Twitter account, the team confirmed the issue was affecting players who put their PCs to sleep whilst the game was still running. Consequently, it's now urging players to save and properly shut down Armored Core 6 before their PCs slip into sleep mode.

"In the PC version of 'Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon', there is a problem that save data is not saved properly under certain circumstances," the developer explained, as translated by Google Translate.

<blockquote><p>The transparent squid is a genetically altered version of the <a href="https://www.mbl.edu/research/research-organisms/hummingbird-bobtail-squid">hummingbird bobtail squid</a>, a species usually found in the tropical waters from Indonesia to China and Japan.

<p>The see-through version is made possible by a gene editing technology called <a>CRISPR</a>, which became popular nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>Albertin and Rosenthal thought they might be able to use CRISPR to create a special squid for research. They focused on the hummingbird bobtail squid because it is small, a prodigious breeder, and thrives in lab aquariums, including one at the lab in Woods Hole...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive's medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is celebrating its three-year anniversary by trumpeting 3m copies sold since launch and by releasing a bunch of statistics gleaned in that time, suggesting players' conflict resolution skills may need some work - or at least, a little less of a preoccupation with murder.


According to Paradox, a grand total of 50,159,539 murder schemes have been successfully carried out since Crusader Kings 3's arrival back in 2020. That's nearly 16m more murder plots than wedding celebrations, which currently sit at 34,480,042. And, of course, more than a few chaotic sorts have thoroughly muddied the waters between the two, with Paradox reporting a total of 7,790 bloody weddings have been msaterminded by players who cleary weren't going to let a bit of murder get in the way of anyone's big day - or possiby vice versa.


Paradox's other shared stats don't open up quite such a fascinating window on player behaviour, but we do know 1,325,198 grand tournaments have been bravely fought since launch, and 1,037,787 grand weddings have also been held. In total, player have amassed more than 317m hours in-game, with nearly 1.4m players having joined this year alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gunbrella, the 2D platform-shooter from developer Doinksoft and publisher Devolver Digital that very much lives up to its title, finally has a release date and will be unfurling onto Switch and PC with a dramatic fwap on 13th September.


Doinksoft's "gritty noir-punk action-adventure" follows the adventures of a gruff woodsman armed with the high-calibre brolly of the title as he embarks on a request for revenge. Soon, because this is very much one of those games, players become embroiled in a conspiracy involving ghouls, gangsters, cops, cultists, and, of course, a corporation run amok.


In more practical terms, that manifests as a side-scrolling action-platformer in which players take on the might of their foes using a brolly that's simultaneously a gun - enhanceable with munitions and upgrades fashioned from gathered scrap - plus a handy all-in-one shield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of last week's splendid Echoes update, No Man's Sky has now launched its latest limited-time expedition, Voyagers, giving players approximately six weeks to complete its objectives and secure some very nifty rewards - including an adorable HoverDroid companion, looking very much like a flying Roomba with eyes.


Voyagers - which, like all previous expeditions, starts players afresh on a completely new save - begins aboard a freighter in No Man's Sky's Oishida system, where Travelers will embark on a journey to complete exploration-focused objectives, discovering new creatures, braving extreme planets, digging up ancient treasures, and more along the way.


If you're new to all this, expeditions are something like No Man's Sky's stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. Completing all objectives within a tier unlocks a new reward exclusive to the expedition and completing all tiers awards one final prize.

Today, the jet-loving team announced the Back to the Future collaboration for its beloved clean-it-up game (which is a bit of a Eurogamer favourite). FuturLab has said this DLC pack, which will retail at £6.49/$7.99/€7.99, will be a faithful homage to Marty and Doc's time travelling escapades. 


So, what can you expect to clean on this DLC's release? Well, of course, you will have to get your watery-jets into every nook and cranny of the series' Time Machine. It really wouldn't be a Back to the Future collaboration without it. Additionally, Doc's van, Hill Valley Clock Tower, the Holomax Theatre and Doc's Time Train will all need to be sprayed to perfection.

<blockquote><p>In an undated note seen by TechCrunch, the unnamed hackers described how they found and exploited several security vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise WebDetetive’s servers and access its user databases. By exploiting other flaws in the spyware maker’s web dashboard&#8212;used by abusers to access the stolen phone data of their victims&#8212;the hackers said they enumerated and downloaded every dashboard record, including every customer’s email address.</p>
<p>The hackers said that dashboard access also allowed them to delete victim devices from the spyware network altogether, effectively severing the connection at the server level to prevent the device from uploading new data. &#8220;Which we definitely did. Because we could. Because #fuckstalkerware,&#8221; the hackers wrote in the note...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

While Bethesda may yet provide an official option in future, there's no way currently to alter Starfield's FOV for yourself within the game. 


But, already, there are a number of downloads available on NexusMods for players to tinker with the FOV, via a new text file added to the game's folder on your PC.

The game released overnight for those who purchase its pricey £85.99 premium edition, which allows access ahead of the release on 6th September.


Already, Starfield has reached a peak of 234,502 concurrent players, according to SteamDB. At the time of writing it's the sixth most played game on the platform, behind only heavy hitters like CS:GO, Dota 2, and Baldur's Gate 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Bethesda described Starfield as having a "NASA-Punk" aesthetic. This term was coined by the development team to describe "a sci-fi universe that's a little more grounded and relatable". Essentially, Bethesda wants its game to have a sense of realism meets grit, and it is doing this by combining the practicality of real-life space technology with the aesthetics of Punk culture. 


Now, this design decision has got the European Space Agency's approval, with its head of branding and partnerships Emmet Fletcher telling me he believes Starfield's NASA-Punk aesthetic "humanises" the game.


"This is the aesthetic where you basically have worn and loved futuretech? Actually, if you look at some of the things we have, it's a little bit like that already," he told me from his office in Paris earlier this week. "We have things that if it works, it carries on working. And there's no need to change it. It's about reliability, and if it's reliable, it carries on."

On August 15, 2023, the Kubernetes project announced the general availability of

Today, we're formally deprecating the legacy package repositories (apt.kubernetes.io

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearbox's Borderlands series is readying for a busy few months; a six-game digital-only Borderlands bundle is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC tomorrow, 1st September, and Borderlands 3 will be making its Switch debut on 6th October.


Starting with the Borderlands Collection: Pandora's Box, as the bundle is officially known, it packages up every game in the series so far, excluding last year's Tina Tina's Wonderlands spin-off - so, Borderlands 1, 2, The Pre-Sequel, 3, Tales from the Borderlands, and New Tales from the Borderlands - and then crams in every bit of accompanying DLC.


It's a significant amount of Borderlands, then, and the bundle comes with a correspondingly sizeable price tag, weighing in at $149.99 USD (or your local equivalent). The happier news, though, is that publisher 2K is offering a range of discounts, starting with a far more affordable $59.99 limited-time launch price. Additionally, 2K has announced a number of upgrade paths for existing Borderlands players, making the cost of entry more manageable still.

Volition, which celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this year, announced the closure in a statement shared on social media, writing, "This past June, Embracer Group announced a restructuring programme to strengthen and maintain its position as a leader in the video game industry. As part of that programme, they evaluated strategic and operational goals and made the difficult decision to close Volition effective immediately."


The statement adds that Embracer is "working to provide job assistance and help smooth the transition for our Volition family members". The move is likely to effect around 340 people based on the studio's most recently shared employment figures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're back from Gamescom and scurrying around trying to let you know everything we saw. We chatted to Phil Spencer, we saw Starfield, we played Sonic and much more. But what else caught our eye?

We sat down this week to chat about what we saw and ended up honing in on some of our personal favourites - games which may not have caught the headlines as much as that big new RPG everyone's going on about. Games which appealed specifically to us - because they felt authentically British - like the wonderfully Yorkshire Thank Goodness You're Here and the North Sea oil rig horror Still Wakes the Deep. 
I adored The Plucky Squire. Ed loved Black Myth: Wukong. Together with Victoria Kennedy, who held the news fort brilliantly back home in Blighty, we chat about the best of what we saw last week in Cologne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow puzzlers, there is good news. Not only has the second expansion for The Case of the Golden Idol been announced, but it is actually available now. 


Known as The Lemurian Vampire, this expansion connects the game's previous expansion Spider of Lanka directly to the main game. "The only thing that stands in your way, is the mysterious Tower Dweller and its powerful Golden artefact," developer Color Gray Games teased. 


The Lemurian Vampire consists of three new scenarios to mull over, as you "follow the perilous journey of the Lemurian delegation to Monkey Paw Island". These delegates are on the search for the fountain of youth (aren't we all?), and of course any riches that may be hidden along the way.

This new console edition is, as you can see in the header image above, very red. It features a little Mario silhouette tucked away on the back corner of the base, as well as some hidden coins inside its back panel.


This new Switch OLED will be available to scoop up from 6th October. While Nintendo hasn't shared specifics yet, it has said to keep an eye out for more information on pre-orders, and presumably a price, "soon".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon's Prime Gaming offers several free titles throughout the month of September, including Football Manager 2023 and the winemaking sim Hundred Days.


In our Football Manager 2023 review on PC, we described it as "the best sim of its kind", however contributor Phil Iwaniuk felt the "lack of major improvements shows an annual release schedule taking its toll".


As for Hundred Days, our Bertie spoke to Yves Hohler, lead designer of the game, back in 2021, to learn more about how his experiences shaped the winemaking sim. It's a cute and cosy game that never feels bogged down by the management aspect, instead presenting a whimsical love letter to Hohler's earlier life.

<blockquote><p>So how was this van turned into a mobile spying center? Well, let&#8217;s start with how it has more LCD monitors than a Counterstrike LAN party. They can be used to monitor any of six different video inputs including a videoscope camera. A videoscope and a borescope are very similar as they&#8217;re both cameras on the ends of optical fibers, so the same tech you&#8217;d use to inspect cylinder walls is also useful for surveillance. Kind of cool, right? Multiple Sony DVD-based video recorders store footage captured by cameras, audio recorders by high-end equipment brand Marantz capture sounds, and time and date generators sync gathered media up for accurate analysis. Circling back around to audio, this van features seven different audio inputs including a body wire channel...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Well, they take me by surprise - I bet you're much more savvy than me. Just in case you aren't, though, and you're a kindred spirit, here's what I stumbled upon.
The tip that really took me by surprise is this. Did you know that you can initiate combat during an interaction cut-scene to affect the outcome of it? It means you can potentially save a character scripted to be attacked - and maybe killed - during the cut-scene before it actually happens. 
The tip comes from content creator ESO Danny. As the video points out, you can interrupt a cut-scene by selecting the "Attack" circular button/option in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red has said its decision to only develop one expansion for its ambitious sci-fi role-player was based solely on "technological" factors. 


The drama around Cyberpunk 2077's initial launch and subsequent withdrawal from sale on PlayStation, as well as the game's overall sales figures, all had nothing to do with it, the developer has stated. 


"As we have announced a long time ago, we're not going to make a second or third expansion," CD Projekt exec Michał Nowakowski said in an investor Q&A held last night (thanks, VGC). "This is the only expansion of the game, and it has nothing to do with the numbers and how satisfied or not we are with sales or anything of the kind."

Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden - which is due to launch for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 on 7th November - sees Life is Strange and Vampyr developer Don't Nod heading to the frozen wilderness of North America, circa 1695, for a tale of ghost-hunting lovers, one of whom is (rather awkwardly given their profession) recently undead.


It's the pleasingly spooky set-up for an action-RPG that promises a "mystical, lore-rich world plagued with supernatural creatures and ancient secrets", and Banishers' extended gameplay trailer follows our heroes Red and the spirit-y Antea as they investigate a haunting at the behest of a New Eden villager - an investigation that leaps between the physical and spectral worlds, and somehow manages to involve quite a lot of gun.

Call of Duty's new voice chat moderation system will employ AI-powered technology from Modulate to identify and enforce against toxic speech in real-time, with flagged language including hate speech, discrimination, and harassment.


An initial beta for Call of Duty's new voice moderation system is being rolled out across Warzone and Modern Warfare 2 starting today, 30th August, in North America, and a global release will coincide with Modern Warfare 3's arrival in November. Activision notes the tools will only support English at first, with additional languages coming "at a later date".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go is slinging open the gates to Paldea with its first batch of additions from last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which join the game from next week.


Pokémon Go's initial Paldea line-up arrives across two consecutive updates as part of its latest season, beginning on Tuesday, 5th September. Sprigatito, Floragato, Meowscarada, Fuecoco, Crocalor, Skeledirge, Quaxly, Quaxwell, Quaquaval, Lechonk, and Oinkologne (both male and female variants) are all up first, with Lechonk even getting a Shiny variant at launch.


This starting batch debuts in Pokémon Go's A Paldean Adventure event, which runs from 5th September until Sunday, 10th September. Other additions include Lechonk-focused Timed Research, Unown in global raids, and various event bonuses, as detailed in Niantic's post.

The game will be published by Humble Games and is being developed by Squid Shock Studios, comprising members of the AM2R team - an unofficial fan remake of Metroid 2.


Bō: Path of The Teal Lotus is, understandably, a Metroidvania, but with a beautiful Japanese art style reminiscent of Okami. Check out the new trailer below.

"Regarding the planned release of Suikoden 1 and 2 HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, we have reached the conclusion that despite the very best efforts of our dedicated development staff to release the Remasters in 2023, additional time is needed to ensure the quality performance and gameplay experience our users deserve," reads the statement.

The sales announcement, made on X (formerly Twitter), specifies copies sold rather than the game's overall players, meaning that 100k number reflects Steam and Switch sales.

In an interview with Games Radar at Gamescom, Iizuka discussed the future of the Sonic franchise and the need to maintain both 2D and 3D Sonic games in parallel.


"When we talk about the brand, we definitely need to have a modern Sonic 3D game," he said. "We also feel we need to have a classic Sonic 2D game. Those are our fundamental pillars that we need to have. We're expanding into movies and TV, but we still need to have both the 3D and the 2D line up for our gaming audience."

Patch 2's headline features include Baldur's Gate 3's first "substantial performance improvements" and better closure to its story. Starting with performance, Larian is promising improvements across the entire game, but says "Act 3 [is] where you'll feel it the most".


Specifically, Patch 2 will target the city of Baldur's Gate itself, which Digital Foundry's recently highlighted as a serious rough spot in an otherwise impressive game. Larian, for its part, calls the area "ambitious technically, narratively, and in scope", saying, "One of the biggest issues with creating games is that technology is always trying to keep up with your ambition, and here we've been hit pretty hard by some setbacks."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pioneers of Pagonia, the intriguing new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich and his team at Envision Entertainment, is launching into Steam early access on 13th December, with a public demo and closed alpha planned before then.


Pioneers of Pagonia, for the uninitiated, whisks players away to the procedurally generated islands of Pagonia, where they'll need to establish a presence - steadily increasingly their reach and influence among the islands' many fantastical, not always friendly inhabitants - through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover along the way.


We got a first taste of Pioneers of Pagonia's city building action back in June - via an extremely adorable in-game reveal trailer - and Envision has been sharing occassional gameplay details in posts on Steam too. Soon, though, it'll be time for players to get stuck in, starting with a closed alpha in September - which will be available to selected subscribers of the studio's newsletter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jupiter Corporation - the studio behind Nintendo's long-running Picross series - has unveiled a new Picross-style puzzler, Logiart Grimoire, which launches into Steam early access on 11th September and Switch sometime next year.


The Logiart Grimoire of the title is a magical book formerly used to solve Logiart mysteries before its power waned, and it comes into players' possession along with its custodian, a helpful wizard-y companion called Emil. That whole fanciful framing device is, of course, secondary to the real business at hand: solving 'picture logic puzzles' that feature horizontal and vertical rows of numbers used as hints to place dots on a grid and form illustrations.


If that sounds familiar, it's because Logiart Grimoire is essentially Picross in all but name (Nintendo owns the 'Picross' title, while Jupiter owns its systems), albeit with an added magic twist hooking into a new "fusion" system that challenges players to figure out how to combine materials gained through solving puzzles to unlock new ones.

We are thrilled to announce the v0.8.0 release of Gateway API! With this

We're especially delighted to announce that Kuma 2.3+, Linkerd 2.14+, and Istio

Service mesh support in Gateway API
While the initial focus of Gateway API was always ingress (north-south)

concepts should also be applicable to service mesh (east-west) traffic. In

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't think I've ever been quite so enamoured by a menu screen. Spinning wheels and pressing buttons to make selections. Picking up figurines with my hands to inspect them closely. Looking down at the dusty library below me from my cosy attic - a library Moss fans will certainly be familiar with.


That's the power of virtual reality, something developer Polyarc is particularly adept at harnessing. Moss and its sequel remain two of the best adventures playable in VR; now there's Glassbreakers, a game set in the same world but with totally different gameplay.


Polyarc describes the game as a live service 1v1 real-time battler. In practice, it's you against another player online aiming to take control of a hex board using three champions who auto-battle in real time. You strategically manoeuvre your characters across the board to destroy your opponent's tower. It looks a bit like holochess in Star Wars, but with woodland creatures instead of aliens.

The announcement comes shortly after the release of real-time strategy stealth game Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew two weeks ago. Other games under Mimimi's belt include Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperados 3.

The statement regarding the studio's closure, attributed to co-founders Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth, was posted on Mimimi's website which, at time of writing, returns a 403 error but can be viewed as a cached version via Google.

The design has taken most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her dual pistols, tank top and braid all taking pride of place in the promotional shots released so far (see header above, and image below). 
This version of Lara also wears the necklace from the Tomb Raider reboot games, perhaps giving us a look at how Lara might appear in the series' future, unified timeline. She certainly looks older than the 'Survivor' timeline Lara, who we last saw in 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

Although a core appeal of the game's mechas are the fun guns and lasers you can outfit your robot with, you can still have a great time without them.
This is what YouTuber ZeroLenny set out to prove by beating Armored Core 6 without any weapons - no guns, no rockets, just pure force and punches.

This new trademark, spotted by WellPlayed, covers a range of categories, including "downloadable game software; computer game software downloadable from a global computer network; downloadable computer game software for use on mobile devices",  and more.  


As a quick reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release on PC back in March. However, in a bizarre series of events, it transpired that developer Fntastic had failed to trademark the game's name, which had subsequently been contested by a company behind a calendar app.

I jest of course. The Armored Core series is very much its own thing. But the inclusion of this iconic weapon is a fun Easter egg present through most FromSoftware games.


The weapon first appeared in the studio's 1994 game King's Field as the Moonlight Sword and has since appeared in most of its games in various guises, from Dark Souls to Bloodborne, Elden Ring, and past Armored Core games.

The option has been removed from Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass sign-up website (thanks, XGP). Now, you must simply pay the full amount for your first month.


Microsoft recently slashed the offer from a full month at £1/$1 to just 14 days, back at the start of August. Eurogamer asked Microsoft for comment on the change at the time, but did not receive any further information.

This blog describes the mixed version proxy, a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.28. The
mixed version proxy enables an HTTP request for a resource to be served by the correct API server
in cases where there are multiple API servers at varied versions in a cluster. For example,
this is useful during a cluster upgrade, or when you're rolling out the runtime configuration of
the cluster's control plane.
What problem does this solve?
When a cluster undergoes an upgrade, the kube-apiservers existing at different versions in that scenario can serve different sets (groups, versions, resources) of built-in resources. A resource request made in this scenario may be served by any of the available apiservers, potentially resulting in the request ending up at an apiserve…]]></summary>

That's according to performance director Aliona Baranova, who posted a lengthy thread to Xitter over the weekend to detail exactly how much work goes into making your favourite games feel "so alive".

"[For a]lmost ALL the dialogue we recorded, we ALSO captured the actors mocap data," Baranova explained. "That means all 248 actors, ALL the NPCs and not just the companions put on a mocap suit and their movements, gestures, and physical choices were recorded and sent along with the audio files for the animators to use in game. which is why the performances feels so alive."

Talking to IGN, Boon reflected on the importance of enabling influencers and content creators to monetise their Mortal Kombat 1-flavoured content, but acknowledged that if there was a mode that "turned off all the blood or something", it would "strip away an entire layer" of Mortal Kombat's very identity.

"Let's say we had a mode that turned off all the blood or something or didn't have fatalities or something like that," Boon said when asked if the NetherRealm team had ever considered a "streamer safe" mode.

"The period, the geographical location of the rig – these all play a crucial role in this narrative-driven horror story," explains publisher Secret Mode. "Fans will discover how the team developed a fascination for cranes and scoured British Petroleum's documentary archives when striving for an authentic representation of a Scottish oil rig in the 1970s."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to the halcyon days of July 2022 (PowerWash Simulator came out, it was fab) and you might recall developer Digital Extremes unveiling its first new property since Warframe's release back in 2013: a free-to-play fantasy action-MMORPG going by the name Soulframe. One and a bit years later, and the studio is finally ready to give it a proper showing, airing 30 minutes of gameplay during its TennoCon 2023 fan convention this weekend.


Soulframe's development is being lead by former Warframe creative director Geoff Crookes (Rebecca Ford has taken over the role on Warframe, driving the sci-fi shooter in a wonderfully bonkers new direction over the last few years) and takes players to a world that, as was explained during its initial reveal, is "a little angry about what's been done to it". This causes the earth to shift throughout the day, giving Digital Extremes the lore excuse it needs to introduce some of its beloved procedural dungeons, here found deep underground.


These dungeons do eventually put in an appearance during Soulframe's 30-minute gameplay reveal, but first we get a more thorough glimpse of how Soulframe's action plays out. The title has been described as a "mirror universe" to Warframe, meaning that while some element will be familiar to fans of the free-to-play sci-fi shooter - those procedural dungeons, for instance - a lot is very different, with slow-paced melee combat in a fantasy setting being the vibe here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its big TennoCon 2023 fan convention news blowout, developer Digital Extremes has pulled back the veil on Warframe's next big expansion, Whisper in the Walls, as well as detailing the free-to-play sci-fi shooter's mid-term future as its celebrates the big one-oh - including perhaps its wildest expansion yet in next year's Warframe: 1999.


Whisper in the Walls, though - which was revealed with the huge 20-minute chunk of gameplay you can see below - is certainly no slouch on the wild front, continuing Warframe's wonderfully weird streak by folding in mysterious multi-storey men, instantaneous dimensional shifts, and even brief glimpses of extremely out-of-place retro Earth tech - 80s mobile phones and beige PCs with CRTs to name a few - in its arresting unveiling.


As explained by Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford in a press event prior to TennoCon, Whisper in the Walls - which introduces new missions types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, alongside a new hub and procedural tile set - is all about going back to the familiar and re-contextualising everything players have seen so far in their ten-year Warframe journey.

BioWare announced earlier this week that it'll be laying off approximately 50 employees - around 20 per cent of its total workforce, according to recent employment figures - as part of a "shift towards a more agile and more focused studio". Each writer had been with the studio for over 20 years. 

Kristjanson is widely credited for not just bringing us the original Baldur's Gate games, but also credited as the writer behind some of gaming's most iconic characters, including Minsc and Mass Effect's Joker.

RoboCop: Rogue City was initially announced back in 2021 and has been delayed several times since. To soften the blow of the delay, however, publisher Nacon has treated us to a new gameplay trailer, which you can check out it all its bullet-y glory below:

It's only a minute and a half long, but the teaser gives us a balanced look at both the cinematics, storyline, and gameplay, including the frenzied FPS action and some of the game's more puzzle-like segments.

If you're hoping for more details, I'm afraid there aren't any at this moment in time – neither Sega nor Atlus have dropped any clues as to what the presentation may entail beyond confirming that the show is expected to last around 50 minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After "diligently monitoring your feedback", Blizzard has posted the notes for its upcoming 1.1.3 Diablo 4 patch, which is set to roll out on all platforms next week.

First up on the docket are Monsters, and specifically, the monster abilities and elite affixes that apply to Crowd Control effects. Blizzard says these changes are aimed at the player having "less time being Crowd Controlled and receiving more recovery time after being Crowd Controlled, especially at higher World Tiers".

From 29th August onwards, Cold Enchanted Elites that attack in quick succession, such as Ghost Archers and Snake Brutes, will" no longer proc the Cold Enchanted on every hit", and Chilling Wind will "spawn overlapping walls less often".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genshin Impact fans are reporting that malicious players are using its co-op feature to infiltrate other players' worlds and delete in-game items like seele, chests, and elemental totems, preventing them from progressing. 

Right now, the issue is primarily affecting players on the Chinese server, but given the issue appears to permanently "brick" progress – even if you reinstall the game or play on a different device – all players are warned not to join any stranger's co-op game until the issue has been resolved. 

According to some players affected by the issue, the "destruction is irreversible". This video, for instance, shows how an elemental totem – used to get around the world – was deleted, bricking the player's time-limited challenges and preventing them from progressing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners eagerly awaiting the previously announced August release of ghost hunting hit Phasmophobia will now have a bit longer to wait; developer Kinetic Games has opted to push launch back to October after a "recent fire incident".


Phasmophobia first made waves when it launched into early access on PC back in September 2020, quickly amassing an enthusiastic following after streamers helped propel its spooky investigatory ghost hunting action - which sees players attempting to gather evidence and complete objectives across a variety of haunted locales - up the charts as Halloween struck.


Since then, Kinetic Games has continued to expand and evolve the core co-operative ghost hunting experience with new maps, new equipment, new ghost types, better haunting AI, and, more recently, custom difficulty settings. And with the PC version developing nicely, a console release was confirmed earlier this year, with the studio announcing Phasmophobia would hit PlayStation 5 (including PSVR2) and Xbox Series X/S this August.

Announced a year ago but still without a release date, Creative Assembly's team-based sci-fi extraction shooter was playable publicly this week for the first time at Gamescom in Cologne, following a somewhat eye-opening summation of its status last week from Sega top brass.


I played a brief match of Hyenas on the Gamescom showfloor and found it a bright and breezy shooter with fun PVPVE moments and some promising zero-G sections. But my time with it was too brief to really leave with much of a lasting impression. 


It's good news, then, that Hyenas will soon be available to play more widely, via a Steam beta test you can sign up for now, with access going live on 31st August. It's from that, I think, that people will finally be able to decide for themselves what is working and what is not - and this is Creative Assembly told me it is waiting for as well.

Factorio, for the uninitiated, casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation. The ultimate goal is to build a rocket ship enabling you to escape the planet you've crash-landed on, which is the point where Space Age kicks in.


In a post revealing first concrete details of Factorio's expansion, Wube explained Space Age continues the journey after those rockets have launched, taking players out among the stars where they can "discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage [their] fleet of interplanetary space platforms."

These comprise a mixture of individual battles, minigames and treasures, with extra modifiers offering a twist on typical gameplay. Perhaps fire-shooting demons or a fiery vortex will interrupt battle, plus plenty more.

FSR 3 is a frame generation solution that operates along similar lines to Nvidia's DLSS 3 - combining frame generation (Fluid Motion Frames) with super resolution upscaling (FSR 2) and latency reduction (Anti-Lag+) in a small number of supported games, with Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum set to first debut the technology. FSR 3 will work on Radeon graphics cards, as well as Nvidia and Intel GPUs. 
So, how does FSR 3 look? At Gamescom, we had a demonstration of both titles running with the new technology active on a Radeon 7900 XTX running at 4K output. Both were running with v-sync on, which AMD recommends for frame-pacing purposes. In the very small Forspoken demo we saw, the game was running locked at 120 frames per second and looked just as a v-synced 120fps should look. The game was running in FSR 2 quality mode providing its own frame-rate boost, with frame-gen then taking you up to the limit. In terms of fluidity and clarity, FSR 3 looked a match for DLSS 3 - a view shared by Alex, Rich and John, who were all present to see the demos in person. A great start for FSR 3.

        <updated>2023-08-25T15:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD has officially unveiled its RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT graphics cards, finally completing its RDNA 3 lineup after announcing its first GPUs in November last year. Both cards are intended to target 1440p displays and run games at max settings, including ray tracing, above 60fps. They'll also support AMD's exciting new frame generation technologies, which we've written up as a separate article after going hands-on with FSR 3 and Fluid Motion Frames at Gamescom. 
Both graphics cards use the new Navi 32 GPU. The 7800 XT gets the fully-enabled 60CU version with a 256-bit memory bus, 64MB of Infinity Cache and 16GB of GDDR6 memory running at 19.5Gbps, while the 7700 XT is cut-down - but not by much at all. It uses a 54CU design with a 192-bit bus and 48MB of Infinity Cache, backed with 12GB of GDDR6 running at 18Gbps. TDP figures are also very similar, at 245W vs 263W, with the 7700 XT clocked higher to make up for its lower CU complement. 
AMD's performance data looks impressive here, with the RX 7800 XT trading blows with the RTX 4070 and the RX 7700 XT more convincingly dealing with the RTX 4060 Ti. Both cards are also shown exceeding 60fps at max settings in a host of recent AAA releases, including The Last of Us Part 1, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Hogwarts Legacy and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's Todd Howard is currently taking part in the great big Starfield marketing push of 2023. But, it isn't just the studio's upcoming space game that we have all been waiting for. Another of Howard and Bethesda's flagship series is Elder Scrolls, and ever since it was announced that The Elder Scrolls 6 was indeed in the pipeline, many have been eager to hear more about what's next. 


The thing is, this next chapter was announced years ago. A little over five years ago, in fact. And since then, we have heard very little about it at all. Back in 2021 Bethesda said it was in a design phase, but from the outside looking in, it is still largely just a name on gaming's often vast horizon. 


Now admittedly, at the time of its reveal, Bethesda was keen to make sure everyone knew Elder Scrolls 6 was still a way out, and said it was in pre-production. But, even so, that was back in 2018. So, does the studio regret announcing this next chapter well before its actual release date, which still remains an unknown (although we do know it will be before Fallout 5)?

The concept of a “sidecar” has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. In 2015, sidecars were described in a blog post about composite containers as additional containers that “extend and enhance the ‘main’ container”. Sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies or as part of a logging system. Until now, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without n…]]></summary>

Sega's Switch version takes the exuberant rhythm-action of the Dreamcast original - where the goal is essentially to orientate your maraca-ing arms to match the position shown on screen then shake in time with the prompts - but slings in new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress.


Additionally, Love Checker mode is back for those eager to gauge their compatibility with a partner based on the accuracy of their maraca-ing prowess, and there's an online multiplayer mode, where the aim is to keep the beat and avoid being eliminated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're big fans of developer Jump Over The Age's highly acclaimed tabletop-inspired narrative RPG Citizen Sleeper here at Eurogamer, so July's sequel reveal was a happy day indeed; and while there's still some way to go until it's release, creator Gareth Damian Martin has now shared a few new details, including confirmation it'll be heading to Game Pass.


Speaking in a video shared by Xbox as part of its Gamescom activities (hence the Game Pass focus), Martin explained Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will once again combine "free-form table-top RPG inspired dice-based gameplay with slice-of-life stories and relatable characters" - only, this time, it'll be "bigger, more varied, more challenging".


Citizen Sleeper 2 brings a new, malfunctioning Sleeper android protagonist and a new setting in the Starward Belt, on the edge of the Helion System. One of its biggest changes, though, is that players get their own ramshackle ship and can assemble its crew, which Martin says is an attempt to "capture what's special about stories like Cowboy Bebop and Firefly, where it's not about hauling tonnes of titanium across the galaxy but...getting into trouble with a complex cast of characters, improvising, making do, and always running on the edge of disaster."

The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support
for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis.
Now, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many
new improvements.
Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems.
This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization
when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial
design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory
was detected on a node.
In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage. This represented
a sign…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Fortnite's stellar current season draws to a close (seriously, the jungle is fab), Epic is cranking the hype handle in anticipation of tomorrow's Chapter 4 Season 4, now officially titled The Final Resort, with a first trailer revealing some of what's to come.


Epic has been teasing a heist theme on social media for a couple of days now, but today's trailer makes things official in a big way, showing a new cast of characters - almost certainly this season's Battle Pass gang - infiltrating a luxury mansion to retrieve a golden skull belonging to Fortnite character Oro (who has some nebulous connection to earlier antagonist Midas, but without Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips' encyclopaedic Fortnite lore knowledge, I have no idea what the implications of this might be).


As the trailer's heist plays out, we see lightning grenades, laser traps, a portable gun turret sneakily concealed in a briefcase (I'd imagine we can safely say all of that will be making an appearnce to spice up this season's gameplay), and, yes, an alarming muscular Fishsticks, proving there's plenty more where that cat with a six-pack and swole unicorn came from.

It also gives a little look at some of the biomes we can expect to traverse on release, which are home to some "unique flora and fauna". You can have a watch below.

However, Xbox has been notably absent from the release schedule thus far, with split-screen gameplay on Series S being the main sticking point.

Pirates got their first taste of Rare's take on Mêlée Island - conjured into existence from the memories of Guybrush Threepwood, thanks to some magical shenanigans relating to Sea of Thieves' purgatorial Sea of the Damned - back in July, in an adventure that admirably captured the series' point-and-click ambience in exploratory first-person 3D.


As you might recall, that first episode - titled The Journey to Mêlée Island - concluded with the return of a certain big bad, and while there are still plenty of unknowns around episode two, The Quest for Guybrush, Rare has already teased that the impassable fog previously preventing exploration beyond Mêlée island's port town will lift, giving players access to the whole of the island and some iconic locations from the series' history.

Two such characters will be The Boys' Homelander and Omni-Man from Invincible. While both of these superhero-types are popular in their own right, they are also remarkably similar in many ways. This is something that had caused the Mortal Kombat 1 community a touch of concern. 


However, concerned we should not be, at least according to Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon. Speaking with IGN, the developer said these two cape-wearing, super-strong chaps will not be clones of each other when they swoop into the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is the relentless predictabilty of freighter life getting you down in No Man's Sky? Well gloom no more because things are about to get a whole lot rowdier thanks to the exploratory space sim's latest free update, Echoes, which introduces epic freighter-to-freighter battles and Star Wars-style trench runs, alongside a new robot race and more today, 24th August.


Starting with those freighter battles, Echoes - which got the tiniest of teases to celebrate No Man's Sky's seventh birthday at the end of last week - expands on the game's previous system, which made it possible for small ships (whether they be piloted by players or NPC pirates) to attack friendly freighters and fleets. Come Echoes' arrival, however, players can encounter situations where merchant fleets are instead under attack from aggressive pirates freighters officially known as Dreadnoughts - which they'll have the option to defend against and defeat. 


In time-honoured video game fashion, that involves attacking their weak spots, which is where the Star-Wars-style trench runs come in, requiring pilots to zip along narrow corridors in their opponents' hull to shoot their red blinky things (a combat HUD overhaul now handily displays the hull integrity of large vessels) until they're completely atomised.

In a new factsheet for the game, Ukrainian studio GSC Game World stated its first-person shooter survival horror game will launch next year, but did not share a specific date outside of "Q1". 

Rumblings earlier in the year had the upcoming sequel pegged with a December release date.

Speaking to Eurogamer's sister site GamesIndustry.biz at Gamescom, Xbox chief marketing officer Jerret West said he believes Bethesda's upcoming space opera is the "doorway" to more regular Xbox exclusives.


"I was sitting there watching the same [Starfield presentation] you were this morning and I was like... this is really the start of something that's going to then lead to Forza, then in 2024 as we go to Hellblade, and we think about Towerborne which is on the show floor, we think about Avowed, and we've got stories we haven't told yet as well, that are going to unfurl in 2024 and 2025," West shared, calling this lineup a "multi-year relay race of first-party titles" with Starfield the "starting gun".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield might be hogging the spotlight right now, but that doesn't mean Bethesda has forgotten about its other babies; Fallout - or more specifically its upcoming live-action TV adaptation - is, for instance, having a bit of a moment right now following a brief Gamescom showing and confirmation from Amazon that it's launching in 2024.


Amazon first announced it was adopting Fallout for its Prime Video streaming service back in the summer of 2020, and since then, we've had ample casting news, on-set photos (official and otherwise), but nothing in the way of a trailer.


That's now (sort of) changed courtesy of a Starfield presentation held at Gamescom today. Amid the space RPG's strictly hands-off showing, designer Todd Howard slipped in what he called a "sneak peek" at Amazon's upcoming Fallout show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SteamWorld Build, the "Anno meets Dungeon Keeper" city builder from Thunderful Games and internal studio The Station, finally has a release date and will be forging new frontiers on PC, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Game Pass from 1st December.


SteamWorld Build is, of course, the latest in the genre-hopping SteamWorld series, which has so far explored the likes of platform mining in SteamWorld Dig and its sequel, tower defense in the appropriately titled SteamWorld Tower Defense, turn-based strategy in SteamWorld Heist, and card-battling RPGing in SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech.


It's all change again for SteamWorld Build, which this time challenges players to construct a city - or, more specifically, a sort of sci-fi-infused Wild West mining town - in a bid to attract enough Steambot workers to dig deep into the nearby abandoned mines which, or so it's rumoured, contain ancient technology that'll help everyone get off the dying world.

"In order to meet the needs of our upcoming projects, continue to hold ourselves to the highest standard of quality, and ensure BioWare can continue to thrive in an industry that's rapidly evolving," BioWare general manager Gary McKay wrote in a post shared on the developer's website, "we must shift towards a more agile and more focused studio. It will allow our developers to iterate quickly, unlock more creativity, and form a clear vision of what we're building before development ramps up."


"To achieve this," McKay continued, "we find ourselves in a position where change is not only necessary, but unavoidable. As difficult as this is to say, rethinking our approach to development inevitably means reorganising our team to match the studio's changing needs."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years after it gave Turok 2 the remaster treatment and eight since it did the same to part one, retro specialist Nightdive Studios is back to finish what it started, and is concluding the trilogy with a Turok 3 remaster for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 14th November.


Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion, as it's more formally known, initially launched for N64 and Game Boy Color (albeit in a considerably different form) back in 2000, around about the same time Jarvis Cocker was meeting up by the fountain down the road. For the trilogy's final outing, players could choose between two protagonists - Joseph and Danielle Fireseed, siblings of Turok 2 protagonist Joshua Fireseed - as they worked to defeat the Oblivion and its Flesh Eater followers in another bout of dinosaur-flavoured first-person shooter action.


Turok 3's remaster - which uses the N64 version as its base - marks the first time the game has been available since its original release, and Nightdive is promising a range of improvements, including enhanced environment art, character models, and updated weapon models, alongside "advanced rendering features" that'll include the likes of anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur.

Parzival's Stone will be the sixth entry in the Broken Sword series - following on from Shadow of the Templars, The Smoking Mirror, The Sleeping Dragon, The Angel of Death, and 2013's The Serpent's Cruse - and will once again be helmed by series originator Charles Cecil.


It sees George and Nico getting caught up in terrifying conspiracy featuring Nazi treasure hunters, brutal mediaeval histories, and Quantum Physics, where ruthless technology entrepreneurs, corrupt government agencies, and billion-dollar global energy corporations are all battling for possession of a manuscript pointing to the secret location of the mythical thousand-year-old Grail, just perhaps not the one we're used to hearing about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phil Spencer has said that Xbox must have a mobile presence in order for the brand to continue to thrive.


In an interview with Eurogamer today at Gamescom in Cologne, Spencer emphasised the importance of mobile for Xbox to continue to grow its audience - and said it was the core reason behind Microsoft's interest in buying Activision Blizzard (including its mobile arm King) for $68.7bn.


"The reason we're in the acquisition discussion with Activision Blizzard King is around their mobile capability," Spencer told me. "Because it's just something we don't have.

It's called the PlayStation Portal remote player, and promises to bring that PS5 experience to the palm of our hands. As Sony previously said, it will come with the features of a DualSense wireless controller, such as adaptive triggers and haptic feedback.


Meanwhile, the remote player's screen will be "capable" of 1080p resolution at 60fps.

This upcoming release has been created in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, and is in development for PC (via Steam), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. 

You can see a little preview of how it is all shaping up in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After much anticipation, Starfield's release is a mere matter of weeks away. And, in a bid to keep the hype train running, Bethesda has shared an all new live-action trailer for its upcoming space extravaganza. 


Revealed as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, the trailer kicks off with an orchestral version of Elton John's Rocket Man. It then shows a young girl, eyes bright and full of wonder, making her way to the launch pad of an equally bright eyed astronaut. He gives her a Constellation badge, and then blasts off into the atmosphere to deal with space battles, planet exploration and, perhaps, a touch of radioactivity. 


It is all rather atmospheric, although I am still hopeful that we will see some more gameplay before the game's final release. You can have a watch of Starfield's live-action trailer in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several years after it first launched, Cyberpunk 2077 is getting an update so impressive, it feels like we are about to see the game's true potential, as it was promised many moons ago, finally realised. 


As part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, developer CD Projekt Red unveiled a brand new teaser for its upcoming DLC - Phantom Liberty - which releases next month. Known as the 'New Ways to Play' trailer, it gave us a taste of what's in store for Cyberpunk 2077's future. 


The trailer gave us a closer look at some new weapons that will be introduced in the Phantom Liberty expansion, such as the Rasetsu sniper rifle and the Grit handgun. It also showed off redesigned cyberware, perks, the Relic skill tree, new vehicles (including vehicle combat, which will see players able to shoot out of the car while driving and the ability to "quickhack" enemies on the road), and a new police system.

        <updated>2023-08-23T10:36:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom 2023 has kicked off - as you might have noticed - and Nvidia has unveiled DLSS 3.5, a new version of DLSS that adds 'ray reconstruction' -  essentially AI-tuned denoising that boosts the quality of ray tracing effects on RTX graphics cards. The firm also announced a new community remaster of the legendary Half-Life 2, new DLSS 3 and Reflex titles and more. 
Let's cover the DLSS 3.5 news first, as this is fascinating. The critical information here is that real-time ray tracing relies on a relatively small number of rays that are cast - certainly far fewer than one ray per pixel - so we don't have a complete picture of the 'ground truth', we have an image with both signal and noise. That means a denoising step is required to fill in the missing pixels, which uses techniques like temporal acculuation and spatial interpolation to generate a higher-quality final image. 
So far, so standard. Normally these denoisers are hand-tuned, but the innovation is that Nvidia has trained an AI network (on five times as much data as they used to train DLSS 3) that can achieve better results. It can use different methods with different ray-traced effects, recognise good pixels and discard bad pixels, and retain the high frequency detail that would normally be smoothed away by upscaling.

It'll be playable solo, with an AI-controlled second character, or with a friend in online co-op.


This announcement marks a change of studio for the Little Nightmare franchise, after the first two games in the series were created by Swedish developer Tarsier Studios. But this isn't unexpected - Tarsier were bought by European megapublisher Embracer back in 2021, which stated at the time that Tarsier would now work on something else.


The rights to Little Nightmares remained with publisher Bandai Namco, meanwhile, which already tapped the UK-based Supermassive to work on the Enhanced Edition of Little Nightmares 2 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

Francesco Romani (Red Hat)
The podresources API is an API served by the kubelet locally on the node, which exposes the compute resources exclusively
allocated to containers. With the release of Kubernetes 1.28, that API is now Generally Available.
What problem does it solve?
The kubelet can allocate exclusive resources to containers, like
CPUs, granting exclusive access to full cores
or memory, either regions or hugepages.
Workloads which require high performance, or low latency (or both) leverage these features.
The kubelet also can assign devices to containers.
Collectively, these features which enable exclusive assignments are known as "resource managers".
Without an API like podresources, the only possible option to learn about resource assignment was to read the state files th…]]></summary>

As per Bungie's info-heavy reveal livestream, The Final Shape - described as "the last expedition of Destiny's first saga" - will see players entering the Traveler via the portal opened at the end of this year's Lightfall expansion for a showdown with current big bad, the Witness. It's an adventure Bungie says will "answer questions on a grander scale" while also giving players the opportunity to connect with familiar companions on a more personal level.


That, of course, includes the formerly deceased fan-favourite Cayde-6, played by Nathan Fillion, who appears to be making a return as a Virgil-style guide manifested by the Pale Heart itself. Seemingly, this world inside the Traveler has reality shaping power that the Witness is attempting to use to refashion the universe in a vision of frozen perfection - the Final Shape of the title - but, as the Guardians enter the Pale Heart, it shifts to reflect their experiences too.

And, thanks to developer NetherRealm's later trailer - confirming the return of Sindel, General Shao, Motaro, and Shujinko - you'll never look at a ponytail in the same way again.


These four latest additions to Mortal Kombat 1's line-up get their introductions in a trailer blending story cinematics and fighting action that, narratively, appears to happen relatively early on in proceedings as Raiden is welcomed into the fold as Earthrealm's champion.


Skepticism almost immediately ensues from General Shao and chums, but doubts are soon laid as we switch to a fresh chunk of typically brutal, bone-shattering in-game fighting action that sees Raiden paired with Shujinko and Sindel with Motaro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A brand-new and rather unsettling trailer for Alan Wake 2 rounded off Gamescom Opening Night Live this evening. 


Remedy's creative director Sam Lake introduced the trailer for the upcoming sequel, addressing Alan's struggle (putting it mildly) to escape the "nightmare dimension" of the Dark Place. This is somewhere the poor novelist has been trapped for the last 13 years, because yes it really has been that long since the first Alan Wake was originally released. 


The new trailer was a combination of in-game live-action footage, in-game cinematics and gameplay, with Lake stating this was to show "the dream-like nature of the Dark Place".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New indie "slapformer" Thank Goodness You're Here was announced at tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live and promises to have players spitting out their tea.


The game is an ode to the hometown in Northern England of its creators Will Todd and James Carbutt who comprise developer Coal Supper. It follows their first game The Good Time Garden, inspired by 90s kids TV and The Beano comic.


"With our first game, we basically followed our noses as far as a shoestring budget and our spare time would allow - so it's been an amazing opportunity to run down that rabbit hole with Panic behind us, and we're excited to show the world what we've found at the bottom," said Coal Supper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're old enough to remember the days when consoles were made of wood and powered by the hopes and dreams of a better future, you might be excited to know Atari is bringing its classic 70s/80s console, the Atari 2600, back as a "modern day faithful recreation" - and it'll even play original cartridges if you still have some lying around behind your Zimmer frame.


The Atari 2600+, as this updated version of the classic console is officially known, has been birthed into the world through the frantic conjoining of Atari and Plaion (formerly Koch Media), and is set to release on 17th November for £99.99/€119.99/$129.99, which is, if nothing else, cheaper than it would have cost you back in 1977.


This new-fangled update features a couple of modern-day revisions including HDMI output, USB power, and multiple screen resolutions, but the selling point here, really, is how close is adheres to the Atari 2600's iconic design - wood panel frontage and all.

In a rather haunting trailer, we were introduced to Poltchageist, a transformed tea caddy. Poltchageist is a grass and ghost type Pokémon that holds the spirit, or at least the regret, of a once rather strict and cantankerous tea master.


According to this new trailer, Poltchageist can go around blowing matcha over people, and then inhale (?) that matcha back into its caddy, seeping some of the inflicted person's life force as it does so. This is something, as you can see in the trailer below, it does to a room full of innocent children. But, it winks at us at the end, so I am sure they are all ok... right?

The production company recently partnered with game developer Monomi Park to bring the colourful slime vacuuming series to a new medium. 


As reported by Deadline, the two companies are looking to continue the story of Beatrix LeBeau on the big screen, however no studios appear to be attached to the project at this time.

This collborative update, which is avaiable now, is part of Cult of the Lamb's anniversary celebrations, with the dungeon-crawling management sim recently turning one. 


However, don't expect to see your flock enjoying a knees up meal with cake and party poppers as part of this crossover. Rather, the team has introduced a new game mode known as Penitence, which will see your Lamb needing to "eat and sleep to survive, along with their followers" for the occasion.

The move is a major change to Microsoft's plans, but one it clearly feels is necessary to get the deal approved by hesitant UK regulators.


If the deal is now approved, streaming rights for all new Activision Blizzard PC and console games released over the next 15 years will be given to Ubisoft - with those rights then existing in perpetuity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following last month's confirmation that a planned sequel to Ubisoft's enjoyable open-world romp Immortals: Fenyx Rising had been cancelled, new details of the ill-fated project have emerged, including word it would have combined elements of Elden Ring and Wind Waker to create a follow-up very different from the original.


As reported by Axios, citing two sources familiar with Immortals 2's development, work on the project (codenamed Oxygen) began in 2021. It was to be a considerable departure from the 2020 original, ditching that game's Greek mythology focus in favour of a setting inspired by Hawaiian Polynesian culture - as we've heard before. Other planned changes, according to Axios, included a more realistic graphical style, the removal of the first game's narrator, less emphasis on puzzle solving, and the addition of a story driven by player choice.


Additionally, Immortals 2 was reportedly aiming to significantly shake up Ubisoft's familiar open-world formula, trading an overabundance of quest markers and guidance in favour of an Elden-Ring-inspired set-up that would require players to figure out their own path forward - by tracking animals, navigating via the stars, or following the wind - as they sailed between and explored fictional islands inspired by the likes of New Zealand, Tahiti, Easter Island, and Hawaii.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghostrunner 2, the sequel to developer One More Level's acclaimed game of tough-as-nails cyberpunk parkour action and swearing extremely loudly at the screen, finally has a release date and will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 26th October.


Set one year after the events of the first game, Ghostrunner once again whizzes players, in the role of returning protagonist Jack, to a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk future for more "FPP slasher" action (I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure what FPP stands for in this instance, but the PP made me laugh), this time battling against a violent AI cult.


Once again, katana violence and acrobatic parkour (I now realise at least one of the Ps might stand for "parkour") are in order, with One More Level also promising a "deeper exploration of the world beyond Dharma Tower", nonlinear levels with complex motorbike sections, more interactive bosses, plus "exciting new modes".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As if a couch co-op mode and a Switch release somehow wasn't enough new Vampire Survivors stuff to be getting on with, developer Poncle has teased plenty more is still to come, confirming everything seen in a recent "Directer's Cut" (yes, with an "e") leak is real and on the way.


Images and footage of an unreleased Vampire Survivors Directer's Cut build shown at a recent event began circulating earlier this month, and Poncle - writing in its update 1.6 release notes - has now acknowledged their existence, explaining, "That's something we've been doing in most events (since TGS 2022): hiding some of the future content for the game in plain sight."


While the developer says the menu screen - and presumably the "Directer's Cut" name - featured in the leak might never actually appear in-game, everything else "is scheduled to be fully developed and released in future free updates." There's nothing like a public roadmap for Vampire Survivors' new content yet, but Poncle confirms "dozens of characters and weapons" are in development for "2023 and beyond" - and to accompany the news, it's shared a teaser trailer giving some of that new stuff a first official airing.
