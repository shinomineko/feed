        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A major new study from UK consumer group Which? has found evidence that the Nintendo Switch's infamous Joy-Con drift is likely caused by a mechanical fault, pointing to fundamental design flaws.


The research found that the Joy-Con's plastic circuit boards showed noticeable wear on the joystick slider contact points, despite only being used for months. It is this wear that ultimately results in drifting. 


In addition, dust and other contaminants were found in the Switch's internal components, despite attempts by Nintendo at dustproofing said areas.

In Kubernetes 1.26, the 1st alpha release of validating admission policies is
available!
Validating admission policies use the Common Expression
Language (CEL) to offer a declarative,
in-process alternative to validating admission
webhooks.
CEL was first introduced to Kubernetes for the Validation rules for
CustomResourceDefinitions.
This enhancement expands the use of CEL in Kubernetes to support a far wider
range of admission use cases.
Admission webhooks can be burdensome to develop and operate. Webhook developers
must implement and maintain a webhook binary to handle admission requests. Also,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Federal Trade Commission has hit Fortnite maker Epic Games with a record-breaking penalty of $520m (£427m) over allegations it previously employed "lax privacy practices" for voice and text chat, and used design tricks to "dupe millions of players" into unintentional purchases. 


The eye-opening judgment includes the largest-ever settlement obtained by the FTC regarding the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, as Fortnite allowed in-game chat and user data collection by default. 


Fortnite holds a "Teen" rating by the US ratings board ESRB, but the FTC has argued Epic Games knew many of its users were likely under 13 years of age and had not obtained their parents' consent.

The entire tournament was simulated inside FIFA 23, which outputted Argentina as the ultimate winners, with Lionel Messi winning the Golden Boot and Emi Martínez winning the Golden Glove awards. The predictions were published November 8th, long before the tournament had started. 


The game's ability to predict the winner for the fourth time in a row is a testament to the accuracy of FIFA's official rankings, but of course the uncertainty of the real world means that not everything was predicted correctly.

FIFA games have now taken the Christmas top spot 10 times since sales records began back in 1984, making it the most popular Christmas number one franchise (versus Call of Duty's nine Christmas chart toppers).

That's according to a survey Microsoft recently circulated to players, inviting views about the current Xbox Game Pass subscription and querying if we'd be willing to accept adverts if the subscription payment was lower.

An unsourced screenshot, written in Spanish and shared on ResetEra (via VGC), alleges that Microsoft is surveying players and exploring a tier-like system - similar to that of Ubisoft+ and Sony's PS Plus - by inviting them to "consider hypothetical subscriptions".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta's VR consulting CTO, John Carmack, is leaving the company after "a decade in VR", accusing the firm of "self-sabotage".

In an internal note seen by Business Insider, Carmack criticised the company's "efficiency", adding that despite Quest 2 being "almost exactly what [he] wanted to see" with its "mobile hardware, inside out tracking, optional PC streaming, 4K(ish) software", he was "offended" at seeing a "5 per cent GPU utilisation number in production".

"We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort," Carmack - who co-created the Doom and Quake franchises - said in the leaked memo. "There is no way to sugarcoat this; I think our organisation is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playtest footage reportedly taken from Assassin's Creed Jade has leaked online.

Allegedly posted to an Assassin's Creed Facebook page and then, in turn, shared with Assassin's Creed and Gaming Leaks and Rumours on Reddit, the footage - which runs for 2.40 mins - was seemingly captured on an Apple mobile device and depicts a combat-heavy sequence, which includes cut-scenes and combat tutorials. You can watch it here. 

Whilst it's not the first we've seen of Jade - Ubisoft dropped a polished teaser earlier this year - it is the first time we've seen raw footage like this (thanks, TheGamer). As always, you can't necessarily expect the final product to look and/or play this way - this is likely a very, very early version of the game - and, as always, if you're interested, you should probably check it out sooner rather than later: these things have a habit of disappearing within a day or two.

In an interview with NME, Schafer revealed that when he started making games back in the '80s, there was "a lot less sensitivity" around, but between developing 2005's Psychonauts and its 2021 sequel, he'd "learned a lot" and was "thinking about how [his] art will be interpreted by the viewer".

"I thought I'd learned a lot, and then we tested a game, and people pointed out a word and asked if we knew what this word means to certain people," the Schafer said. "I had no idea – and people will criticise that and say 'woke culture, PC police' and stuff – but for any art, I'm thinking about how my art will be interpreted by the viewer.

As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Criterion's vice president and general manager Matt Webster has left the studio after 23 years, as has head of studio development and 17-year Criterion veteran Alan McDairmant.


They're joined by senior technical director Andrei Shires, who has been with the company for 16 years, as well as executive producer Pete Lake, who first joined Criterion in 1996. Head of content Steve Uphill also leaves following his most recent 10-year stint at Criterion. All are said to have left the developer to "explore new opportunities outside of EA".

Kubernetes v1.24 introduced an alpha quality implementation of improvements
for handling a non-graceful node shutdown.
In Kubernetes v1.26, this feature moves to beta. This feature allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node after the original node is shut down or in a non-recoverable state, such as the hardware failure or broken OS.
What is a node shutdown in Kubernetes?
In a Kubernetes cluster, it is possible for a node to shut down. This could happen either in a planned way or it could happen unexpectedly. You may plan for a security patch, or a kernel upgrade and need to reboot the node, or it may shut down due to preemption of VM instances. A node may also shut down due to a hardware failure or a software problem.

Reports of a co-op component for the Horizon series first emerged in 2020, when VGC claimed the studio had initially been looking to implement the feature as part of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn before ditching it to focus on other areas. Co-op was then said to have been revived for Horizon Forbidden West, potentially as a separate mode, but again didn't make the final cut.


As confirmed by Guerilla's recruitment-focused Twitter feed, however, the studio's co-op dreams are still very much alive, with the company currently hiring for an internally developed "separate online project" in the Horizon universe. This will feature a "new cast of characters and a unique stylised look", and allow friends to "explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together".

The match-three game was the Mega Drive's answer to Tetris, with coloured gems falling from the top of the screen to iconic music. I played the hell out of this as part of the Mega Games One compilation. 


The other games joining are Golden Axe 2, Alien Storm, and Virtua Fighter 2. See them in action in the trailer below.

But on the bright side, his lovely dog's now in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, courtesy of its new-gen update.


Henry Cavill's dog, an American Akita named Kal, is a bit of a star in his own right, frequently snapped alongside the actor and apparently a bit of a fixture on-set of Cavill's projects. During filming of The Witcher, for instance, Kal was said to have been on location the "entire time". 


And now Kal has been immortalised in digital form, appearing at the Devil's Pit for players that get the "good" ending in The Witcher 3's new quest In The Eternal Fire's Shadow, introduced as part of CD Projekt's long-in-the-works new-gen update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years after announcing his departure from Blizzard Entertainment, and his retirement from the games industry at large, long-serving Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen is returning to the company as creative advisor on the Warcraft franchise.


Metzen's retirement from Blizzard in 2016 came as a shock to many a fan. He'd been with the company for 23 years at that point, serving as head writer and lore guru (or, more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) and had become one of its most recognisable faces across countless BlizzCons.


"The reason I use the word 'retire'", Metzen explained in a statement at the time of his departure, "is because I'm not going to some other company or starting up new projects or anything remotely like that. It's been a long, amazing stretch of years. Now it's time to slow it down. Rest. Lay around on the couch and get fat."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima's idiosyncratic post-apocalyptic courier adventure Death Stranding is the latest in an increasingly long line of video games to get the movie treatment, courtesy of a newly announced collaboration between Kojima Productions and Barbarian executive producer Alex Lebovici's Hammerstone Studios.


Death Stranding, for those unfamiliar, stars The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier trying to make ends meet in an aggressively wet corner of rural Wales. One day, his clothes unexpectedly fall off, a baby turns into goo, ...fish?! Then, walking!!!!


Okay, so that's not exactly how it goes (although it's not not, either) but it's fair to say Death Stranding's atmospheric tale of a post-apocalyptic United States - which, yes, does look at awful lot like Wales - is not short of wonderfully outlandish ideas. There are eerily invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, a mysterious plane of existence known as the Beach, and much, much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insomniac has confirmed Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the eagerly awaited sequel to 2018's acclaimed open-world swing-em-up - will arrive on PS5 next "fall".


That's not, admittedly, anywhere close to being an actual launch date, but at least fans can now update their diaries and keep their anticipation in check. And the not particularly specific announcement may have something to do with the fact the "fall 2023" release was leaked earlier this week after a writer on the project added the date (since removed) to their online CV.


Official confirmation, however, has now arrived courtesy of a new post to the PlayStation Blog. "What a year it's been for PlayStation Studios," Spider-Man 2 creative director Bryan Intihar wrote as part of the news, "here at Insomniac Games we’ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers. Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022...and here’s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're in the mood for some entertainment that's both fun and free, you might like to point your browser in the direction of No Man's Sky studio Hello Games, which has just made the two mobile instalments of its very excellent arcade stunt racer series Joe Danger playable on the web for the grand total of zero pee.


More specifically, those with a hankering for some stuntery and a browser within arms reach can test their racing mettle in Joe Danger Touch and its follow-up Joe Danger Infinity, which were initially released on iOS in 2013 and 2014.


Both games, you might recall, unceremoniously vanished from the App Store in 2017, following Apple's decision to end support for 32-bit apps with iOS11. But in a lovely moment at the start of this year, they each received a surprise re-release. "It's always been a secret shame of ours that the success of No Man's Sky left Joe Danger unloved," Hello Games' Sean Murray explained at the time. "For the last two years we've had a hobby project of bringing Joe Danger back to life. Slowly rebuilding it piece by piece through eight years of Unity changes."

In a new video, Shen revealed Starfield's faction quests will be more similar to those from Bethesda's Skyrim, in the sense that players will be able to experience each faction independently. This will not be a Fallout 4 situation, which saw players being locked out of factions after joining another (something that was a bone of contention among some members of the community).


"One of the early things we decided on was making sure that the main quest actually kind of gives you a little bit of a tour of the settled systems and all of the major players there so that we can give you a taste of what they're going to be up to," Shen explained.

<p>The idea was to bring together people from a variety of disciplines who are all thinking about different aspects of democracy, less from a &#8220;what we need to do today&#8221; perspective and more from a blue-sky future perspective. My remit to the participants was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea is to start from scratch, to pretend we’re forming a new country and don’t have any precedent to deal with. And that we don’t have any unique interests to perturb our thinking. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government mid-eighteenth century politicians technology could invent. The twenty-first century is a very different place technically, scientifically, and philosophically. What could democracy look like if it were reinvented today? Would it even be democracy­&#8212;what comes after democracy?...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Dynamic resource allocation is a new API for requesting resources. It is a
generalization of the persistent volumes API for generic resources, making it possible to:
access the same resource instance in different pods and containers,
attach arbitrary constraints to a resource request to get the exact resource
you are looking for,
initialize a resource according to parameters provided by the user.
Third-party resource drivers are responsible for interpreting these parameters
as well as tracking and allocating resources as requests come in.
Dynamic resource allocation is an alpha feature and only enabled when the
DynamicResourceAllocation feature
gate and the
resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group are enabled. For details, see the

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the show has been in development since March and will, notably, focus on Kratos' dad years in Midgard as per 2018's God of War reboot, rather than the ultra-violent Greek-mythology-inspired adventures of Kratos' earlier games.


Here's how the show's official description teases its plot: "When his beloved wife dies, Kratos sets off on a dangerous journey with his estranged son to spread her ashes from the highest peak - his wife's final wish. Kratos soon realises the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new gods and monsters for the fate of the world."

Larian leader Swen Vinke said this during a patch pre-briefing a week ago, telling press - myself included - they'd now like to concentrate on finishing the game, which is fair enough.
No release date for Patch 9 has been communicated.

In a post announcing the news, Epic described the services and servers it's pulling as "out-of-date", and said it was making the move as it transitions to exclusively support its Epic Online Services "with its unified friends system, voice chat features, parental controls, and parental verification features".


Online services will be disabled on 24th January, with 13 games affected - although owners will be able to continue playing offline solo and multiplayer modes:

Announced as part of Private Division's fifth anniversary celebrations, the new project is said to be in "early development" for unnamed platforms. Further details are scant to the point of non-existent, but Bloober has confirmed we won't be seeing the fruits of its efforts for quite some time, with a launch not expected before 2025.


In a statement accompany today's announcement, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno referred to the unnamed project only as an "exciting new survival horror game", saying it "will help us become a leader in the horror industry at large".

Throughout the day, users have been taking to social media and to Steam's review section to make their feelings clear about the game's performance on their PC setups. Overall, the suggestion is the game is punishing on CPUs - even high-end ones - if you have ray-tracing switched on.


Some users have said they've since used Steam's roll-back functionality to remove the update entirely.

However, Hungarian digital artist Zsolt Kosa actually envisioned this collaboration much, much, earlier. Perhaps, even before developer CD Projekt Red did. 


Two years ago, Kosa shared two mocked up posters of Elba in Cyberpunk 2077 to his ArtStation page. The first of these shows Elba with ice blue cyber-eyes and an impressively collared coat (as shown in this article's header image). The second shows him with some rather fancy looking sunglasses, and that same very fetching coat.

The stakes are a little different when said assignment is, say, a £50 game from a best-selling, worldwide franchise. And unfortunately for someone at Square Enix, that assignment was Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion.
Shortly after the game's release yesterday, the eagle-eyed writers over at Kotaku noticed a Getty Images watermark on one of the in-game paintings.

Bypassing the launcher is not as simple as hitting uninstall - 2K clearly wants you to run its software as part of the game's startup. Still, the thread has a point-by-point list of instructions for those who do want to give it a go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of us have probably settled in quite comfortably to Mario Kart 8 by now. After all, it has been out for almost nine years on the Wii U, while the Switch's Deluxe edition has been around since 2017. 


However, Nintendo's most recent Mario Kart update does not address MK8. Rather, it's for its predecessor - the 3DS's Mario Kart 7.


This update - or, to give it its official name, the version 1.2 update - is the first update that this game has received in a little over 10 years. Here are the full notes from Nintendo - "Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Unknown Worlds' superb underwater survival adventure Subnautica has just received its first major update in two years, bringing with it new building bits, performance enhancements, accessibility features, quality of life improvements, and over 800 bug fixes.


Unknown Worlds' latest update - officially titled Living Large, or 2.0 to its friends - is described as a "labour of love for the entire Subnautica team", and aims to address "a tonne of tech debt and [bring] across some improved code from Below Zero."


To that end, Living Large moves Subnautica and its follow-up Below Zero onto unified versions of Unity, enabling the developer to implement quality of life features, fix bugs, and performance improvements in Subnautica that were already available in the more recent game.

This latest listings follows Ubisoft's announcement back in November that, having skipped Steam in favour of Epic and its own Ubisoft Connect since 2019, it would soon be bringing a select number of its games to Valve's storefront, starting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Anno 1800, and the free-to-play Roller Champions.


That initial line-up expanded by one last week with Immortals Fenyx Rising, and now Watch Dogs Legion's official January release brings Ubisoft's post-2019 Steam selection up to five.

This update will see players decking their halls with boughs of holly, thanks to a collection of new seasonal items that have been added to the game. This includes charming stockings, twinkling fairy lights, and even Santa's very own sleigh (which comes complete with its own reindeer team).


Meanwhile, thanks to the new Christmas tree additions, you could even say you will now be able to spruce your campus up a bit. After all, these decorations are tree-mendous (ok, I'll stop now).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How safe do you feel in your Valheim base? Walls secure, trenches dug out, windows sealed? Even with all these precautions in place, you may still not be safe from Valheim's new enemies. With the introduction of the Mistlands update comes a new type of raid - and this one is wreaking havoc on established player bases. Rather devastatingly, some players are losing homes that took them hundreds of hours to make. 


The new event, called "they sought you out", unleashes hordes of insects on your player base - and worse still, they can fly. Seekers and seeker soldiers are capable of hopping over ditches, then mulching stone walls like they're made of papier maché. The event can occur at any time after you've defeated the Plains boss Yagluth, so anyone who has completed Valheim's biomes is vulnerable to these attacks. And sure enough, it's taking a lot of players by surprise. 


"When we got raided we got caught off-guard and lost our three-story base which took us hundreds of hours," said one Reddit user. "It was protected with walls, trenches, and most upgraded gates - it didn't slow the seekers down at all... We all rage quit after surviving the raid, but after looking around at the aftermath, we realised any amount of rebuilding wouldn't matter because we lost seasonal item buffs for comfort level and we could not survive another raid like that."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch has removed LGB Alliance from its list of approved charities following backlash from streamers and viewers.
On 7th December, Twitch announced it had added "tens of thousands" of new global charities to its charity tool for streamers. The feature was added in July in a US-only beta, and became available to all partners in August. Twitch and Paypal Giving Fund do not take a cut of donations raised through the charity tool.
"We added tens of thousands more Paypal-vetted charities from the US and dozens of different countries," Twitch stated in its blog announcement. The company came under fire from users when they discovered LGB Alliance, a UK-based hate group opposed to trans rights, was one of the new additions to Twitch's approved charities. The group was controversially granted charity status in April 2021 by the UK government.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the confirmation (because, let's be honest, we all knew it was coming) Returnal is making the jump to PC, its PC specs have been detailed - and they have raised more than a few eyebrows.


Unlike other big PlayStation releases, it is recommended that you have a colossal 32GB of RAM available on your PC to play Returnal at its best potential. 


For comparison, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection and Horizon Zero Dawn both recommend having 16GB of RAM available - that is the minimum of what Returnal asks for. Meanwhile, God of War only asks for 8GB of RAM for the best PC experience.

That's according to Bloomberg, who cited sources familiar with the negotiations between the two companies. This deal was allegedly made as part of Microsoft's offer to Sony last month, which would see the Call of Duty series kept on PlayStation consoles for 10 years should the acquisition go through. 


Since Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard in a record-breaking deal worth $68.7bn, there have been concerns voiced about the presence of Call of Duty on other platforms.

The long-awaited day has arrived: HostProcess containers, the Windows equivalent to Linux privileged
containers, has finally made it to GA in Kubernetes 1.26!
What are HostProcess containers and why are they useful?
Cluster operators are often faced with the need to configure their nodes upon provisioning such as
installing Windows services, configuring registry keys, managing TLS certificates,
making network configuration changes, or even deploying monitoring tools such as a Prometheus's node-exporter.
Previously, performing these actions on Windows nodes was usually done by running PowerShell scripts
over SSH or WinRM sessions and/or working with your cloud provider's virtual machine management tooling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you had hoped to take refuge in your newly acquired LA Thieves operator skin while playing Warzone 2.0, well here is your heads up - as part of the game's Season 01 Reloaded update, it's about to get a whole lot more visible. 

Once upon a time, this ensemble from Call of Duty eSports team LA Thieves basically allowed wearers to become one with the shadows thanks to its all-black design (bar a red embossed "LA" on the chest). However, it has now been given a colourful little update by Activision. So, yes, we will be able to see you now. 
As Ishraq reported earlier this month, this skin by LA Thieves was labelled  "Roze 2.0", which is a reference to the Roze skin that was released for the original Warzone and Modern Warfare back in 2019. This skin was notoriously famous for making its wearer hard to see. In fact, following its release, Raven Software was forced to edit the skin to make it easier for other players to see the elusive Roze skin wearers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 only released at the end of October, but it's already the biggest-selling game of 2022 in the US.

Topping the November sales chart, that means Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has not only knocked Elden Ring off the coveted top spot, but it's also resisted stiff competition from other games released last month, including God of War: Ragnarök and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. 

According to data from NPD and reported by VGC, that also makes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 the fastest-selling entry not just of the year, but of the franchise's storied history, too, hitting $1bn in sales in just 10 days.

To celebrate, developer The Outsiders has "new weapon skins to collect, combos to master, and Archdevil Mode to suffer" the latter of which is an all new brutal difficulty level. There's also a free digital artbook up for grabs, too.

The changes come courtesy of update 1.5, which as well as the usual bug fixes and QoL improvements, also invites players to "rediscover each map in order to find Coats of Arms Collectibles".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Canadian court has approved a class-action lawsuit against the creators of Fortnite, Epic Games.

We first reported that the Canadian legal firm was preparing a class-action lawsuit against Epic Games back in 2019. It accused the developer of "knowingly" creating the "very, very addictive game", Fortnite, but had been in limbo ever since as the court assessed whether or not the case could proceed.

Now, however, it seems the court agrees with the plaintiff that the claim "does not appear to be frivolous or manifestly ill-founded" and, according to CTV News, just because there's "no certainty" that Epic created an "addictive" game it "does not preclude the possibility that the game is in fact addictive and that its creator and distributor are presumed to know this".

In his acceptance speech for The 2022 Game Awards, during which Elden Ring secured the coveted Game of the Year award, Miyazaki said the win "really, really encourages" the team and thanked George R.R. Martin for his "great mythos for this game".

After thanking the "entire Elden Ring team members, everybody at From Software, our partner, Bandai Namco, all collaborators, and last but not least, Mr. George R.R. Martin", Miyazaki said:

Polygon reports that the lawsuit - filed in various countries right across the world, including the UK and Germany, due to varying copyright law - maintains free-to-play Hyper Front is "a copy of substantial parts of Valorant", including its "characters, maps, weapons, weapon skins, and charms".

Whilst player data for Hyper Front is currently unknown, Polygon points out that the Google Play Store says it has over a million downloads and almost 50,000 reviews. And whilst Hyper Front is currently unavailable in the US, where Riot is based, it is playable in many other territories where a mobile version of Valorant is currently in development and expected to release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's gradual tiptoe back onto Steam is set to continue, with the publisher's enjoyable 2020 action-adventure Immortals Fenyx Rising now confirmed as heading to Valve's platform.


Launched at the tail-end of 2020, Fenyx Rising followed the same pattern as all new Ubisoft PC releases since 2019, skipping Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12% revenue cut compared to Valve's 30%.


However, it appeared Ubisoft's position on its preferred storefronts was about to shift in November after listings for a Steam version of Assassin's Creed Valhalla were discovered, and the move was confirmed by the publisher itself in December, when Valhalla, Anno 1800, and Roller Champions were all announced to be heading to Valve's platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If your eyes are in need of something soothing after blinking your way through the night and this year's Game Awards, then may I introduce you to Europa, an absolutely lovely looking new adventure from developer Helder Pinto.


Sporting a gorgeous Ghibli-esque art style, Europa promises a "peaceful game of adventure, exploration, and meditation" on terraformed moon in Jupiter's shadow. Here, among lakes, meadows, mountains, and the remnants of a fallen civilisation, players - cast as an android called Zee - can run, glide, and fly across the landscape as they try to uncover the story of their creator.


Alongside an "intimate story about growing up and humanity's relationship with nature", Europa promises puzzles, secrets, and hidden dangers, with players able to gradually upgrade their Zephyr jetpack to boost higher and further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, it's the morning after the night before - and what a night. While The Game Awards 2022 dominated the news, Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover faced a major setback with the FTC and Diablo 4's big release date announcement was superseded by serious claims of mismanagement and crunch.  

The awards ceremony was an eventful affair, even without its climactic and rather concerning stage invasion. The typical array of trailers for games like Final Fantasy 16, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor and Street Fighter 6 came thick and fast, alongside big announcements for things such as Death Stranding 2, Hades 2, Horizon Forbidden West PS5-only DLC and Armored Core 6. 
Did Geoff Keighley keep his pledge to make this year's ceremony speedier? Not really. Somewhere, Christopher Judge is now on the second day of his acceptance speech. So, here for you today is a recap of everything we thought was really worth your time - and what we think Death Stranding 2 should actually be titled. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Wesley Yin-Poole.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Omega Force's creature-battler Wild Hearts is inching ever closer to its February 2023 launch, and in the run-up to its release, the developer has introduced more of its behemoth targets in a new trailer.


Wild Hearts, a collaboration between Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series) and EA Originals, transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom's Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan.


This isn't Omega Force's first turn in the monster hunting genre, of course; it previously dabbled in its two Toukiden games, and Wild Hearts expands on those to introduce an experience where up to three players can seamlessly battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.

The Deluxe Edition is one of three now available to pre-order via Blizzard's Battle.net, as well as the slightly cheaper £80 Digital Deluxe Edition, and the £60 Standard Edition.


All pre-purchases get you access to the game and its open beta, plus a handful of extra cosmetics. The two pricier versions add extra cosmetic options and the game's seasonal battle pass, with the Ultimate Edition upgrading that latter reward into its "accelerated" version.

You can see it for yourself below.


So, yes, there is Elba in character (also, hey Keanu!). But just who exactly is that character? Let's Idris the Elba in the room...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8 got its moment in the sun at The Game Awards last night, and for fans of the long-running fighting game franchise like me, one thing stood out: Jun Kazama's return.


Jun Kazama, Jin's mother, made her debut in 1995's Tekken 2 and hasn't been a playable character in the mainline Tekken series since. 27 years later, she's back and it looks like she hasn't aged a day. Tekken time logic, I guess.


The trailer below focuses on the Tekken 8 story (Tekken has an actual real life Guinness World Record for being the longest-running video game storyline!). Once again the Mishimas are at each other's throats, with Tekken 8 picking up where Tekken 7 left off and the war between father and son Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama heating up. When all appears lost, Jin looks up and sees his mother's dramatic return. I doubt there's much interest in a family selfie.

Transformers: Reactivate was shown last night at The Game Awards 2022, with a fresh trailer you can see below. The project is being designed as an online action game for one to four players where you play as some of the franchise's most iconic characters. And yes, you can transform between a vehicle and a bot (obviously!)


The news comes alongside word that Splash Damage has acquired Bulkhead, the UK studio behind World War 2 shooter Battalion 1944, which is also working on Transformers: Reactivate.

Earlier this year, Belarusian-based developer Sad Cat Studio announced it was delaying Replaced's release into 2023 in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 


"The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families. As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced," the studio said in May.

The teaser shows off the new childlike visuals and hints at the story, but until now it wasn't clear what the hidden chapter related to.

Saber Interactive's hotly-anticipated (by me) sequel shows Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus stomp and shoot and generally smash to bits the xenos scum that is the Tyranids (they're the evil aliens, Tom).


The setup here is pretty simple: the Tyranids are devouring worlds (nom nom) and it's up to the Ultramarines to stem the tide. Cue big battles in which one man army Titus teaches the 'nids a lesson in brutality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is partnering with Bandai Namco to bring its ambitious-looking new anime-styled MMORPG to the west next year, on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. 


The online free-to-play role-player was previously announced for an early spring 2023 launch in Japan. Amazon is handling publishing duties for its wider launch, due in the second half of the year. 


Blue Protocol is described as a sci-fi fantasy adventure set on the war-torn planet of Regnas, following thousands of years of non-stop conflict. It's your job to restore balance, save the planet, and also explore its surface for side-quests and mini-games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a tease of a partnership earlier this year, Joe Madureira's Airship Syndicate studio and Warfare developer Digital Extremes have unveiled the former's new free-to-play online action-RPG, Wayfinder, coming to PC and consoles next year.


Set in the fractured fantasy world of Evenor, players take on the role of Wayfinders as they embark on a quest of "endless action and adventure" to restore their home from a foul, consuming force known as the Gloom.


Airship (which made Ruined King: A League of Legends Story and Darksiders Genesis) says each playable Wayfinder comes with its own unique story, play style, and abilities - which can be augmented by using Echoes from fallen foes - with players able to wield arcane magic, mystical tech, and "cunning" weapons as they embark on hunts and expeditions to new locations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 finally has a release date! It's only narrowed down to a month, rather than a day, but here it is: August 2023. Mark it in your calendars and take the whole month off. Say Eurogamer said it was okay.
The August 2023 release date means Baldur's Gate 3 arrives, in full, just shy of three years after it first appeared in Steam Early Access, in October 2022. A lot has happened there of course - a lot of tweaking and tuning and honing the experience of the game. Its popularity allowed Larian to breathe and make BG3 a bigger, better thing.
Just for giggles: the August 2023 date also means BG3 arrives 23 years after BG2, and 25 years after the original Baldur's Gate. I imagine you're probably not laughing if you remember those.

This news follows a tease earlier today from creator Hideo Kojima, that showed a blanked out visage with the words "How come?" written across it. Many guessed this face was that of Léa Seydoux, and they were right as she is very much front and centre of Death Stranding 2's (or DS2's) announcement trailer, which you can see below. 


Joining Seydoux are actors Norman Reedus (who previously let slip that the game was in development), Troy Baker, Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna. The game will be coming to PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new investigation into Diablo 4's development has painted a picture of chaos and mismanagement at Activision Blizzard, reportedly resulting in a dash to meet a release date - said to be 6th June next year - that staff believe is "unlikely" to be met without "many hours of overtime or cut features".


In a new report by The Washington Post, assembled after speaking with 15 current and former Blizzard employees, it's claimed Diablo 4's development was troubled from the off, with leadership at the time instilling the project with a "sense of inertia" as large parts of the game were constantly revamped and scrapped - including a planned battle royale mode.


Talking to The Washington Post, team members laid much of the early blame at director Luis Barriga and lead designer Jesse McCree, both of who left the studio in 2021, amid serious allegations of institutionalised discrimination and harassment at Activision Blizzard. Colleagues claim, for instance, McCree "would grow intrigued by different aspects of the game and then lose interest and hand it off to other people without finishing what he started."

"We continue to believe that this deal will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers," Microsoft's vice chair and president Brad Smith said in a statement. "We have been committed since Day One to addressing competition concerns, including by offering earlier this week proposed concessions to the FTC."


"While we believed in giving peace a chance," Smith concluded, "we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court.”

There's more too, but the replay editor is undoubtedly the star of the show, giving players the tools to turn their favourite takedowns into cinematic mini-masterpieces. There are options to adjust camera placement, for instance, to define lens parameters, choreograph camera movement, and even add effects including slo-mo and speed-ups.


You can get a taste of the tools available in Sloclap's autumn update trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has launched a fresh legal front in its ongoing battle against the State of California, which has been suing the Call of Duty publisher over reports of workplace misconduct and sexual harassment since the summer of 2021. 


In response, Activision has now filed its own lawsuit against California's recently-renamed Civil Rights Department (CRD) - the same agency currently trying to sue Activision - over claims the department has taken too long with its own case and not been transparent over its connections with the media and labour unions (thanks, Axios). 


Activision is now asking a judge to force the CRD (previously the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, or DFEH) to produce various internal documents. These include details of the department's discussions with the Communication Workers of America, the union which has been repeatedly in the headlines this year for helping organise games industry QA staff (including several teams at Activision).

Meanwhile, over on the main PlayStation account, the team has a small reel promoting an 11-minute long Forspoken stream that promises to show off new gameplay.

We're promised a bumper show from The Game Awards tonight, with the inevitable Hideo Kojima-shaped announcement - Geoff can't let a show go by without a nod to his bessie - plus news on the likes of Street Fighter 5, Jedi Survivor and Diablo 4 and plenty more besides. And only a small amount of it has leaked ahead of time! 


The show kicks off at 12.30am, and while we're also promised a more compact running order than previous years I'd expect a runtime north of two hours. So do bring caffeine, and lots of it.

The channel, which frequently reports on trivia from a specific game or franchise, has been issued a takedown notice from Nintendo. This takedown pertains specifically to Did You Know Gaming's video on Heroes of Hyrule - a Zelda game for the Nintendo DS akin to Final Fantasy Tactics, that was pitched to Nintendo by Retro Studios.


In response to this notice, Did You Know Gaming stated it considers this move by Nintendo a "slap in the face for video game history preservation".

If you have got past this point, you'll likely remember the bizarre eight-minute scrolling text story which comes next, before the end credits begin proper. 


It's a truly odd read - structured as a conversation between two higher beings apparently observing you - the player. Perhaps even odder, it was never officially licensed to Minecraft developer Mojang, and subsequently is not owned by Microsoft.

And Malindy wasn't alone in thinking this way. Even the powers that be at Sony reportedly didn't feel the game warranted a sequel. 


But, according to Days Gone director John Garvin, the game itself was not to blame for this tepid reception. Rather, it "failed" because of a combination of "tech issues", "reviewers who couldn't be bothered to actually play the game" and "woke reviewers who couldn't handle a gruff white biker looking at his date's ass." Errm, ok then.

No more! A new update to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch adds a custom item option and it's the best thing to happen to the game. 


Honestly I'm surprised it's taken Nintendo this long to implement. Yes, items are used to even out the skill levels of racers as well as increase the mayhem, but item customisation was included in Super Smash Bros years ago. Finally Mario Kart gets the same treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has solved its long-running supply issues for the PlayStation 5 - in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, anyway. 


The PS5 has proved hard to find ever since it arrived two years ago, with stock problems leading to shortages and scalping. 


PS5 availability has been a global issue, though one Sony now says it has solved in its home country. Speaking at the recent PlayStation Partner Awards event in Japan, company boss Jim Ryan said the console's ongoing supply problems had now finally been put to bed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lorry containing over £500k of Evercade EXP Limited Edition stock has been reported stolen, in what developer Blaze Entertainment has described as a "terrible, potentially organised attack". 


Exact details of the theft are unclear, though it's reported the incident took place as stock was being moved between warehouses. Nobody was injured, but all stock was taken.


The £130 gaming handhelds had been destined for despatch to customers in the UK and USA, and elsewhere in the world outside of Europe. A separate consignment bound for customers in mainland Europe is unaffected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is giving players the opportunity to try out the online multiplayer portion of its PlayStation Plus subscription service for free this weekend, starting on Saturday, 10th December.


That means anyone can put PlayStation 4 and 5's online multiplayer through its paces - teaming up with friends, strangers, or other non-specific entities across all multiplayer-supporting games - between 10th-11th December without needing to cough up the usual fee.


The requirements to particpate are fairly obvious: players will need to register a PSN account, will need an active internet connection, and will need access to a game that supports online play. Why not, for instance, give Elden Ring's new PvP-focused Colosseum update a try?

Resurgence (not to be confused with Heartland, Ubisoft's upcoming free-to-play Division game for PC and consoles), will, like other titles in the series, be an open-world third-person shooter RPG set in post-crisis America - specifically, Manhattan - following a deadly virus outbreak.


Ubisoft's previous chatter around Resurgence has promised a fresh story campaign offering a "new perspective on key story events" from past The Division games, with players once again being cast as agents allied to the Strategic Homeland.

This, of course, is a somewhat different scenario to Minter's Polybius, which was inspired by an '80s arcade cabinet game that never actually existed. Akka Arrh, though, is very much a thing, having been designed by Atari's Mike Hally and Dave Ralston as a prototype back in 1982.


Minter's reimagining of Akka Arrh - of which only three cabinets are still said to exist - has been created in partnership with Atari, and promises "a cascade of words, colour, shapes and sound [flowing] around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Delightful VR fantasy adventure Moss and its sequel have been confirmed as PSVR2 launch titles, with both games arriving alongside Sony's new hardware on 22nd February next year.


The original Moss, if you're unfamiliar, initially launched as a PSVR exclusive back in 2018, gaining widespread acclaim for its charming tale of a tiny mouse, Quill, on a journey through a beautiful, human-sized fantasy world. Eurogamer called it "the finest PSVR game to date".


Its best trick was its hybrid first-person/-third-person perspective, giving players full control over Quill while simultaneously letting them view the action through the eyes of a spirit, able to interact with the environment to solve puzzles and help Quill on her journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to the early 90s and you may recall two aliens with a love for funk music crash landing on earth. These aliens were ToeJam and Earl, and their initial crash landing here (all via the Sega Mega Drive) resulted in their names being elevated to somewhat of a cult status in the industry. 


Now, over 30 years since their first landing, ToeJam and Earl will soon be coming to a new medium. Yes, these two aliens will be joining the likes of Lara Croft, Nathan Drake and Mario, who have all made the transition to the big screen. 


Per The Hollywood Reporter, a new feature film from Amazon based on ToeJam and Earl's video game escapades will be heading our way sometime in the future. This upcoming project will be written by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo, whose previous work includes Hotel Transylvania 4. Meanwhile, basketball player Stephen Curry will also be producing the project through his production company Unanimous Media.

As detailed in Nintendo's announcement tweet, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's new custom item feature works with offline VS races, as well as "certain" online modes, and gives players the ability to either randomise items that'll be available in their races or to toggle specific items on or off. And yes, that means competitions can now be entirely item-free.


That's not quite the end of it, either; in Team Races and Battles, it's even possible to allocate items to specific teams, meaning you can really pile on the pressure - perhaps all spiny shells against an increasingly sweaty palmed team armed with nothing but hooters?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Sonic the Hedgehog and Genshin Impact are fighting over various claims of foul play in relation to this year's Players' Voice fan vote at tomorrow's Game Awards.


The Players' Voice category is a 100 percent fan-voted award which this year has five possible choices as its finalists: Elden Ring, Genshin Impact, Stray, God of War Ragnarok and Sonic Frontiers. Over the past week, the vote has become mired in controversy amidst accusations of a broken poll, bots and bribery.


To be clear, there's no credible evidence of bribery, despite various fan claims foul play must be to blame for both Sonic (with a lower Metacritic score than other entrants) and Genshin Impact (whose detractors point out was first released in 2020) being way-off in the lead.

As part of this announcement, Spencer stated "Microsoft is committed to helping bring more games to more people - however they choose to play."


So, how do people choose to play Call of Duty? Well, for this current generation of consoles at least, not on a Nintendo Switch. There simply just isn't the option to do so.

<blockquote><p>The idea is simple, yet previously not clearly articulated: to ensure privacy, information should be divided architecturally and institutionally such that each entity has only the information they need to perform their relevant function. Architectural decoupling entails splitting functionality for different fundamental actions in a system, such as decoupling authentication (proving who is allowed to use the network) from connectivity (establishing session state for communicating). Institutional decoupling entails splitting what information remains between non-colluding entities, such as distinct companies or network operators, or between a user and network peers. This decoupling makes service providers individually breach-proof, as they each have little or no sensitive data that can be lost to hackers. Put simply, the Decoupling Principle suggests always separating who you are from what you do...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Japanese newspaper Asahi reported today that Naka now stands accused of violating financial laws in relation to another mobile game it is claimed he had insider knowledge of - Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier.


Specifically, Naka is accused of purchasing 144.7m yen's worth of shares in its developer ATeam (worth around £865k) before The First Soldier was officially announced.

Pickford was asked what he was getting up to during his downtime - and, amongst other things, eventually revealed he was still hooked to Fortnite. (And no wonder - its freshly-minted Chapter 4 has reinvented the game.)

Xbox boss Phil Spencer tweeted the announcement, which also confirms the company's commitment to continue to release Call of Duty games on Valve's Steam platform "simultaneously to Xbox", if the gargantuan $69 billion offer to buy Activision Blizzard is approved.

The announcement is a direct response to the scrutiny the acquisition has come under from a raft of organisations across the world, chief among them the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years since its initial unveiling and multiple delays later, Dead Island 2 is finally almost upon us - and ahead of its launch next April, publisher Deep Silver has shared more of its open-world, zombie-pulverising antics in a new digital showcase.


Those with itchy fast-forward fingers will be pleased to know the vast majority of Dead Island 2's 15-minute showcase is taken up by largely uninformative live-action sequences, featuring a group of zombie apocalypse survivors as they stumble across a copy of Dead Island 2 in a fancy LA mansion. It's entirely inessential fluff, but, tucked between all that, Deep Silver does manage to squeeze in a few minutes of gameplay.


Admittedly, there's little that's particularly revelatory in there - the publisher basically just used the time to reiterate the obvious fact you'll mostly be maiming various zombie types gruesomely until they're dead - but it did give us a decent new look at Dead Island 2's appealingly sun-kissed gore, as well as a taste of its weapon roster, including hammers, machetes, bear claws, a "shit-tonne of guns", and various makeshift tools of destruction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite has released its December update, bringing with it the earlier-than-anticipated arrival of a custom game browser, an updated version of Halo 3's The Pit map, and more.


Halo Infinite's new custom game browser is designed to work in tandem with the Forge Beta introduced as part of November's Winter Update. It was originally planned for release as part of next year's Season 3, but as developer 343 Industries explains in its blog post, "We fully agree with players who felt [it] should be a priority — it's a key support structure for what players create in Forge and a pillar for the community." 343 says this initial V1 release is "likely to have some rough edges" but will continue to evolve over time.


Elsewhere, today's update introduces Empyrean, a "reimagining" of Halo 3's The Pit map that's been officially rebuilt in Forge by 343. "How do Halo Infinite's toys, like its limited-use Equipment, alter some of those dynamics and affect how you traverse the combat dance floor?," the developer asks in its introduction. "Maybe the enemy team managed to grab the rockets first, but you went and acquired the Repulsor to protect yourself... We can't wait to see what new memories are forged in this proving ground!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hindsight, the acclaimed narrative adventure from developer Joel MacDonald and publisher Annapurna Interactive - in which players experience a woman's entire life, from birth to the present day - is now available on Xbox One and PlayStation. 


Hindsight is the follow-up McDonald's acclaimed iOS botanical puzzler Prune (McDonald is also a former Call of Duty designer) and tells the story of a woman revisiting her childhood home following her mother's death. As she sorts through her old belongings, she unlocks old memories that players can experience first-hand in the form of dioramas.


"Hindsight asks you to slow down and pay attention to the little things left behind," explains the game's official blurb. "Piece these things together and shift your viewpoint until you find just the right perspective to pull you deeper into the past... Linger as long as you wish, but sooner or later you must come back to the present."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors, the acclaimed minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is getting its first dollop of paid DLC next week in the form of Legacy of the Moonspell, arriving next Thursday, 15th December, on Xbox and PC.


"In eastern lands, a clan has fallen," explains Poncle in its DLC announcement post. "The Moonspell, once vigilant guardians of a sorcerous valley nestled in the mountains, have been overrun by hordes of yokai and oni. Though treacherous, this hive of spectral activity may provide some clue as to the location of a vampire. If not, at least it'll be entertaining to defeat thousands of wayward spirits in the process."


More specifically, Legacy of the Moonspell introduces eight new characters - including Miang Moonspell, Menya Moonspell, Syuuto Moonspell, and Babi-Onna - plus new monsters, six new music tracks, and a "huge" new stage incorporating the likes of an abandoned castle, yokai-infested village, and snow-covered mountain.

The concept, dubbed Metroid Tactics, was the brainchild of Metroid Prime developer Paul Tozer. The idea was one of several pitched following the conclusion of Retro's Metroid Prime trilogy - and another which was ultimately turned down. 


Tozer discussed the pitch publicly for the first time this week in a new Did You Know Gaming video which details the game's planned setting and storyline as a prequel to the entire Metroid series.

The emote, named "Tidy", allows your character to dance like Snoop Dogg in his 2004 song Drop It Like It's Hot. It's one of a handful of emotes from Fortnite's early days thought to use unlicensed dance moves - other examples of which sparked largely-unsuccessful legal threats from individuals keen to take Epic Games to court. 


Fans were surprised to see the emote return upon the Item Shop's midnight UK time refresh - though its appearance was shortlived, and it was pulled from sale just a couple of hours later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New leaks have appeared online which reportedly show details for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2's Season 2.  


Key art from marketing material show-off a Japanese theme, with artwork teasing the return of the classic map Castle (thanks, WhatIfGaming).   


Castle was originally a multiplayer map in Call of Duty World at War, set in an old Japanese fortress in World War 2. The map most recently made a return in Call of Duty Vanguard, but this would be the first time the map would appear in the franchise's modern theme of shooters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red has announced plans to wind down support for Gwent, its Witcher card game spin-off, and laid out how it will hand over future balancing decisions to Gwent's community of players.


The game's final 72 cards will release next year in three expansions, set to launch in April, July and September 2023. After this time, CD Projekt will transition from its own monthly balance changes to a system voted on by players. 


Dubbed as "Project Gwenfinity", the idea is that Gwent can be left to just a skeleton crew within CD Projekt to keep an eye on, while the game's community decides on tweaks to exisiting cards to keep up with the current meta.

Following a four-week election process, should the majority of workers support unionisation, Microsoft, who purchased Zenimax for $7.5bn in 2021, will recognise the union. 


The company has also pledged to remain neutral throughout this process. "We applaud Microsoft for remaining neutral through this process and letting workers decide for themselves whether they want a union," said CWA president Christopher Shelton.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has formally confirmed its offer of a 10-year contract to keep releasing Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms after its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


In an opinion article on the deal published in the Wall St Journal,  Microsoft president Brad Smith committed to making its 10-year COD contract "legally enforceable by regulators in the US, UK and European Union" - territories in which the company was previously felt to be struggling to get its acquisition agreed without making some sort of concessions.


The majority of the opinion piece repeats the same arguments for the deal we've heard from Microsoft many times before - that it would be good for both consumers and game developers, and that Microsoft is still struggling in a sector where it is "stuck behind Sony's dominant PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch".

This includes the biggest hitters from Microsoft's first-party line-up for 2023, such as Bethesda's Starfield, Arkane's Redfall and the company's own Forza Motorsport reboot.


Of course, as is standard on Xbox, all of these will continue to be made available on day one as part of Xbox Game Pass. There's no suggestion today of any other pricing being changed - such as for that subscription service, or for Xbox hardware.

Simply put, the game's rocky 2020 launch changed the studio's plans. CD Projekt Red had to prioritise fixing the single-player experience, and multiplayer suffered as a result.
"We really needed to look at what were the priorities for Cyberpunk [after it launched]," Philipp Weber told me when I visited the studio last week. Weber was senior quest designer and coordinator on Cyberpunk 2077. Today, he's acting narrative director of the new Witcher game codenamed Polaris.

Now, Netflix is doing what it can to reassure fans that, while this will clearly be a change for the series, it will also bring a "different energy" to the show that the producers are excited about.

Speaking at The Witcher: Blood Origin's UK junket, showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich addressed the series' recasting with a variety of outlets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Panda, the eSports organisation at the centre of a high-profile row between Super Smash Bros. fans and Nintendo, has ditched its controversial CEO following complaints about his behaviour. 


In a statement issued this morning via Twitter, Panda confirmed it had "heard the concerns of the Smash community" and booted out its boss Alan Bunney. The company will now work with "outside advisors to form a temporary interim management committee" as players quit the company's events in their dozens.


It follows a week of bad press for Bunney and his company, as it emerged Nintendo was shutting down a fan-run Smash Bros. tournament and continuing to partner with Panda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend, we got another look at HBO's upcoming The Last of Us TV adaptation. 


I am a big The Last of Us fan (something you may have noticed), and have watched this trailer multiple times already. Now, for your pleasure, I have pulled out some of the little details that you may have missed on a first watch. 


As a quick recap before we dive on in, you can see this trailer below. Please note, after the video I will be discussing points that could be considered spoilers for Naughty Dog's video game series. If you are keen to avoid these, this is your cue to head elsewhere.

Previously, the FTC's involvement in the deal had signalled a headache for Microsoft, which is facing regulatory approval around the world, and close scrutiny here in the UK. A lawsuit looked imminent - potentially blocking the acquisition, or carving out major concessions.


However, a fresh report by the New York Post into the FTC panel set to decide the deal's fate suggests the trade body is now looking more likely to let it pass.

Forensic container checkpointing is based on Checkpoint/Restore In
Userspace (CRIU) and allows the creation of stateful copies
of a running container without the container knowing that it is being
checkpointed. The copy of the container can be analyzed and restored in a
sandbox environment multiple times without the original container being aware
of it. Forensic container checkpointing was introduced as an alpha feature in
Kubernetes v1.25.
How does it work?
With the help of CRIU it is possible to checkpoint and restore containers.
CRIU is integrated in runc, crun, CRI-O and containerd and forensic container
checkpointing as implemented in Kubernetes uses these existing CRIU
integrations.
Why is it important?

Then followed an extended 30-minute event mode where players were tasked with reforging the Island anew, using a mix of familiar and fresh locales that look set to appear in Chapter 4.

Cross-play was initially announced during Digital Extremes' TennoCon fan event in July 2021, with the developer saying it hoped to launch the feature before the end of that year. It obviously missed that target and then some, but, 12 months later, cross-play is finally here.


"Warframe will always be a game best played and enjoyed with friends and that's why launching Cross Platform Play is such an incredible moment for us," Digital Extremes' chief operating officer Sheldon Carter said in a statement announcing the news. "Together with our partners, we have broken down the walls that have prevented our players from experiencing the thrill of Warframe as one united community."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has shared a lengthy statement in response to recent claims it told organisers of the unofficial Smash World Tour that the popular fan competition, including this month's concluding Smash World Tour Championships, could "no longer operate".


The Smash World Tour, an "international tournament circuit in which competitors for both Ultimate and Melee can qualify for the Smash World Tour Championships", is described by organisers as the "the largest esports tour in history, for any game title". This year's event, which ran between March and November, incorporated 6,400 live events around the world, attracting 325,000 in-person entrants.


With the tour now concluded, this year's Smash World Tour Championships was due to beheld between 9th-11th December, but organisers announced on Tuesday (as reported by Kotaku) they had "received notice the night before Thanksgiving from Nintendo that we could no longer operate". As such, December's Championships and the entirety of next year's Smash World Tour have been cancelled.

It's a change of tack from a studio better known for its Harvest Moon-style life simulations - such as Portia and its follow-up My Time at Sandrock. Let's School looks instead to be more in the vein of Theme Hospital - or more specifically, the recent school-set Two Point Campus.


Let's School is described as a "cosy and colourful" management sim where, as headteacher, you design everything from the school's building layout to its school clubs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo once had bold plans to quickly branch out into a raft of mobile game releases - but no more. When it launched its first app, Miitomo, back in 2016, Nintendo's then-boss Tatsumi Kimishima said four more smartphone games would debut in the following 12 months.


In reality, Nintendo took several years to hit that milestone, and in the years since has shuttered several of them. Just one new Nintendo mobile game has launched in the last two years: Pikmin Bloom, developed by Pokémon Go maker Niantic.


This week, as Dragalia Lost joined Dr. Mario World and Miitomo on Nintendo's shutdown game scrap pile, the publisher offered a brief update on the continued importance it places on its smartphone efforts.

PlayStation 4 and PS5 versions of the game will arrive in just over a week, on Tuesday 13th December, following the game's debut on Nintendo Switch and Steam earlier this year.


Neon White tasks you with shooting through levels - both in terms of the guns you fire and the speed in which you traverse. A single-player first-person shooter, it arms you with a variety of guns you can then trade-in for parkour moves via a card-based system, with the aim being to finish levels as quickly and cleanly as possible. Here's a look at how it all works:

Debugging software in production is one of the biggest challenges we have to
face in our containerized environments. Being able to understand the impact of
the available security options, especially when it comes to configuring our
deployments, is one of the key aspects to make the default security in
Kubernetes stronger. We have all those logging, tracing and metrics data already
at hand, but how do we assemble the information they provide into something
human readable and actionable?
Seccomp is one of the standard mechanisms to protect a Linux based
Kubernetes application from malicious actions by interfering with its system
calls. This allows us to restrict the application to a defined set of
actionable items, like modifying files or responding to HTTP requests. …]]></summary>

Long-time Rare fans should immediately recognise the trio's contributions to the studio's beloved back catalogue; Wise, for instance, was responsible for many memorable tracks in the Donkey Kong Country series (and provided the sublime score for Nintendo's Tropical Freeze), more recently composing music for Sumo Digital's Snake Pass and Playtonic's Yooka-Laylee.


Kirkhope's impressive credits include Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, Viva Piñata, and more recently, Ubisoft's Mario + Rabbids, and Bayliss has designed characters for the likes of Battletoads, Killer Instinct, Diddy Kong Racing, and Yooka-Laylee. He was famously also behind Donkey Kong's redesign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jens Andersson, lead designer on Starbreeze Studios' acclaimed shooters The Darkness and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, has joined Wolfenstein developer MachineGames to serve as design director on its highly anticipated Indiana Jones project.


The new Indiana Jones game was unveiled early last year, although details were limited. It was described as featuring an "original story" unconnected to the upcoming Indiana Jones 5, with Bethesda's Todd Howard executive producing in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games.


Andersson, who also helped create Eurogamer favourite Yoku's Island Express, announced he'd joined as design director on the "very special" Indiana Jones project in a statement shared on Twitter (thanks VGC), explaining, "I'm so excited about what we are building, and the way we get to do it - featuring one of [the] most iconic characters ever."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest was set to return next year, but organisers now have a date for diaries everywhere, with 2023's live showcase set to air on 8th June. Things are a little bit different in 2023, however, and next year's event marks the first time Summer Game Fest will be open to the public.


The show - which promises a mix of premieres, live gameplay demos, and announcements - will take place at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California, in front of a live audience of fans. Tickets go on sale in "early" 2023, but for those unable or uninterested in attending in-person, Summer Game Fest will also stream live on all major streaming platforms.


Summer Game Fest 2023 marks the event's fourth year of operation, and, as is now customary, the live showcase will kickstart a season of smaller events and showcases from participating developers and publishers. Specifics will follow at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frictional Games, the studio behind masterful sci-fi horror Soma, has announced a new entry in its acclaimed Amnesia series. It's called Amnesia: The Bunker and is heading to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2023.


The Bunker - which will be the fourth Amensia game, following on from The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, and last year's Rebirth - promises to be something a little bit different, favouring "unscripted" semi-open-world horror over its predecessors' more linear scares.


"For the first time, players are equipped with high levels of freedom to impact gameplay, choosing their playstyle as they explore at will," Frictional explains in its announcement. "With hardly any scripted events, and constant tension brought about by an ever-present threat, it is up to each player to finesse their approach to survival."

Tweaks to the game since its first round of testing include a fresh option on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S to "reduce input delay" as a setting in the game's Graphics menu, which will "shorten the gap between your inputs and the action happening on-screen".


Alternatively, on PC, you can toggle your Vsync setting off. The trade-off here is that this may increase the likelihood of screen-tearing, Capcom warns.

Destiny's Crucible boss Lord Shaxx and Saint-14 will both see their armour sets recreated in Valhalla. There's also an armour set designed to look like Monster Hunter's Odogaron.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a nice surprise, Disney Dreamlight Valley's promised December update has been significantly bolstered - with the addition of Stitch (from Lilo and Stich) and a variety of Christmas extras, all on top of the previously-announced Toy Story expansion.


Stitch will be the third new character included in the free update, after Toy Story's Woody and Buzz, as the popular Disney Pixar live service life simulation continues to grow in size. 


The update will also add winter outfits for your character and for NPCs (Merlin will dress up as Santa), the ability to build snowmen (how very Frozen), set up campfires and cook marshmallows.

The Game Pass Twitter handle began its own version of a hangman-like teaser a couple of days ago, merely saying it was a fun little guessing game being shared for "no reason in particular". 


We were then all told that there were three words to guess, each consisting of four letters, and the second letter of the last word was an A.

When speaking about observability in the cloud native space, then probably
everyone will mention OpenTelemetry (OTEL) at some point in the
conversation. That's great, because the community needs standards to rely on
for developing all cluster components into the same direction. OpenTelemetry
enables us to combine logs, metrics, traces and other contextual information
(called baggage) into a single resource. Cluster administrators or software
engineers can use this resource to get a viewport about what is going on in the
cluster over a defined period of time. But how can Kubernetes itself make use of
this technology stack?
Kubernetes consists of multiple components where some are independent and others
are stacked together. Looking at the architecture from a containe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe's highly anticipated The Duviri Paradox expansion might be delayed, but today brings a little something new to tide players over until its arrival next year, courtesy of the survival-based Lua's Prey update, available now on all platforms.


"As The Void exposes ancient scars and long-forgotten secrets," developer Digital Extremes says of its latest update, "something sinister rumbles on Lua as the Grineer descend upon these newly exposed halls seeking possible treasure, corrupted by its long-dormant Orokin Neural Sentry. Under the guidance of The Lotus, the Tenno embark on a mission to investigate this destroyed piece of Lua formerly used to monitor Void Conjunctions."


Lua's Prey serves as a "light prequel" to The Duviri Paradox, adding two new story-based Conjunction Survival missions featuring thematic teasers for next year's expansion. These can be located at two newly added Lua nodes - Yuvarium and Circulus - and challenge players to maintain Life Support in the usual way. The twist, though, is that a Thrax enemy will spawn after every successful Survival round, increasing Life Support depletion by 50% while it remains alive, and requiring players to summon their Necramechs in order to defeat it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has unveiled a new post-launch content roadmap for Sonic Frontiers, promising the likes of new playable characters and story content across three free DLC updates throughout 2023.


There's no estimated time of arrival for any of Sonic Frontier's newly announced updates, but the first will introduce a juke box, photo mode, and a selection of new challenge modes. That'll be followed by a second update celebrating Sonic's birthday - and adding new Koco and a new open zone challenge - suggesting Sega's aiming for a June-ish launch for this one.


Finally, there's the biggie, with Sonic Frontiers' third free update of 2023 teasing new story content and playable characters. The artwork for Update 3 features Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, but it's unclear if these are the new playable characters or just a placeholder design flourish.

Rise initially launched as a Switch console exclusive last March, with a PC release arriving in January this year. Both versions then received the game's major Sunbreak expansion in July.


And now it seems Monster Hunter Rise is ready to spread its Rathalos-sized wings once more, with prolific leaker Tom Henderson's Insider Gaming reporting Capcom will bring the acclaimed title to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass on 20th January 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch has implemented a new Shield Mode feature, allowing streamers to pre-set safety settings.


The feature offers customisable controls that can be activated in one click, including channel modes (such as follower or sub only chat), chat verification options, and AutoMod levels.


This is a much requested feature, especially in the wake of last summer's hate raids against streamers from minority communities, which remain ongoing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon has revealed the next batch of titles being made available to Prime subscribers as part of December's Prime Gaming line-up, which this time includes classic FPS Quake and the wonderful Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.


id Software's Quake is, of course, a stone-cold classic, serving up a seminal slice of FPS action that - somewhat unbelievably - celebrated its 25th anniversary last year.


Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons mightn't be quite as well-known, but its story of two siblings on an increasingly fantastical quest to find a cure for their father's mysterious affliction is an absolute delight, and a game I find myself returning to every couple of years. The gist is players must overcome its various platform and puzzle challenges by controlling both brothers simulataneously, but it's also gained a proper two-player co-op mode over the years.

"Our best kept 'secret' that absolutely no one found out about is finally revealed!" Firaxis wrote last night. "Hulk smashes his way on to the Midnight Suns roster 2nd December."

"Seriously Nintendo... this is my eight year old cousin's account," wrote one fan on reddit, sharing a screenshot of the game - visible from Furry Hentai Tangram's store page - depicting a mostly-undressed character with cat ears.

We were expecting this last chapter of Eivor's story to arrive next week, on 6th December. Announcing its early release last night, Ubisoft blamed "an unforeseen glitch in the Animus". 


As expected, this final dollop of Valhalla storyline sees Eivor wrap up her time in England and head off to North America one last time - where the game's opening shows she is buried. There's time for a few final goodbyes with some noteworthy people from Valhalla's long campaign, and then it's off to find out more about what Odin has been up to.

The trailer showcases a good look at the film's version of Princess Peach (voiced by Anya Tayor-Joy) while Chris Pratt's Mario only gets a couple of lines of dialogue. Overall, it's a fun glimpse at some familiar Mario locales and characters, translated for the big screen. 


If you're a Nintendo nerd like me, you've probably rewatched the trailer more than once to spot everything going on in the background. And there's some cool Easter eggs - particularly if you like the extended Donkey Kong family. Let's give it one more watch and dive in.

Plenty of bugs and exploits have already been found, whether it's creating body horror or duplicating shiny Pokémon, but this is on a different level. In the game, you're supposed to only have one of the legendaries, whether that's Koraidon or Miraidon, but now you can fill up your boxes with them.
These new-found glitches have been widely discussed in the Pokémon community, and they're not that difficult to pull off. One has been tested by yours truly, and I can confirm it works. The other requires you to have beaten the end-game, which I've not reached yet so I can't confirm at the moment whether it works or not. Beware some spoilers ahead!

In fact, it's a bit of a treat for Mario fans all-round, casting its net wide to introduce a host of familiar faces, places, and power-ups, all given a vibrant movie makeover. It's the first time we get to hear Anya Taylor-Joy's no-nonsense Princess Peach, for instance, as well as Charlie Day as Luigi, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong, even though the latter's debut was mainly just a grunt.


Elsewhere, the trailer delivers a breakneck tour of the movie's beautifully reimagined Mushroom Kingdom, giving us a stroll across a bridge amid of flurry of Cheep Cheeps, a glimpse inside Peach's castle, and, of course, the crowd-pleasing addition of karts hurtling across Rainbow Road.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR - developer Supermassive Games' rail-shooter spin on its acclaimed narrative horror series - has been confirmed as a launch day title for Sony's PlayStation VR 2, meaning it'll arrive on 22nd February next year.


Switchback isn't Supermassive's first foray into spooky VR, of course; it previously adapted its cinematic horror game Until Dawn into both a VR prequel and a gaudy, rollercoaster-like rail shooter called Rush of Blood. And Dark Pictures: Switchback VR is very much a spiritual successor to the latter, sending players on a "nightmarish and horrifying" branching VR thrill ride through scenes that should be familiar to Dark Pictures fans.


"Survive the Ghost Ship and its distorted apparitions," Supermassive teases, "confront hideous demonic incarnations of persecuted 'witches'. Fight for your life against other-worldly vampires and escape the horrifying World's Fair Hotel's sadistic serial killer."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has unveiled Lost Between Worlds, a new expansion for Far Cry 6 that'll whisk players away to a fractured alien version of Yara when it launches on 6th December.


Lost Between Worlds' surreal extraterrestrial action begins when Far Cry 6 protagonist Dani Rojas inadvertently stumbles across a crashed alien ship inhabited by an alein AI known as FAI. Unfortunately for Dani, FAI immediately seals the surrounding area and demands they embark on a quest to retrieve five crystals needed to repair their ship - each one hidden away in a mysterious rift containing a fractured simulation of Yara.


There are familiar locations twisted into a surreal architectural kaleidoscope, others plunged deep underwater, and still others ravaged by endless lightning storms. Every rift features multiple routes via orange and purple portals, and players will need to use their combat, parkour, and puzzle skills to pick their way through and retrieve the crystal housed in each one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A three-year study into the impact of video game loot boxes on young people has concluded that such mechanics cause "financial and emotional harm" to teenagers and children. 


The report, published by Newcastle and Loughborough Universities, tracked the gaming habits of 42 families with children aged between five and 17, and interviewed another 30 parents, carers and video game designers.


In short, the study found children struggled to track spending in video games where "highly alluring" digital items were advertised to them using techniques borrowed from regulated gambling.

Wilkie first stated his intention to introduce the Classication Amendment (Loot Boxes) Bill last year (via Kotaku Australia). Back then, he wanted any games with loot boxes to be given a R18+ rating, and a new "advisory" classification to highlight their presence.
The bill was filed yesterday by Wilkie, and the details of it can be viewed on the Australian government's website.

Speaking to the BBC alongside the series' 25th anniversary, developer Colin Macdonald revealed "GTA went through a lot of different iterations and [had] quite a troubled development", stating the first game "wasn't really regarded well for most of the time it was in production."

Specifically, Bohemia has called for players and content creators to "use their game footage responsibly", "refrain from using clickbait video titles" and "always state clearly that the video originated from a video game" rather than footage from a real-life conflict.


Arma 3 gameplay videos have a history of being mistaken for real-world footage - even by professional news organisations - and this problem has only increased since the current conflict in Ukraine has begun, Bohemia said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed a set of six motion-tracking gadgets that will allow a user's body to mimic an avatar's moves.


Known as Mocopi, this set will enable mobile motion capture, thanks to sensors worn around a user's head, waist, wrists and ankles. When paired with the compatible smartphone app, these trackers can then be used to animate an avatar within said app. 


In addition to adding your avatar to real-world locations, users will also be able to combine avatars and background images within the app. Meanwhile, it will also use VRChat as a motion input device. You can see just how Mocopi looks in action via the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red has described the upcoming remake of the series' first game as a "story-driven, single-player open-world RPG - a modern reimagining of 2007's The Witcher".


It's the first detailed description we've had of the remake, and suggests a more from-the-ground-up reworking of the original role-player than previously thought. 


Thanks to the success of The Witcher 3, the series is now thought of as a fully open-world franchise. But that was not the case back in the original Witcher game, which featured a number of separate large maps and various smaller areas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If it's bug squishing you want, you're in luck; developer Offworld Industries has unveiled Starship Troopers: Extermination, a new 12-player, squad-based co-op FPS coming to Steam early access next year.


Inspired by Paul Verhoeven's cult-classic 1997 movie, Starship Troopers: Extermination drops up to three squads of four players onto the front lines amid an Arachnid assault, challenging them to work together to complete objectives, acquire resources, build and defend their base of operations, and finally escape to the extraction zone.


There are three classes to choose from - Assault, Support, and Defense, each with their own weapons, equipment, and perks - alongside a base building system that sees players using resources acquired from planetside refineries to construct walls, towers, ammo stations, and various other amenities in an effort to gain the upper hand in battle.

Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures' Illumination animation division, and sees Chris Pratt, in the role of Mario, heading an all-star cast including Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.


We got a promising first glimpse of the Mario movie back in October, with its debut trailer managing to look the part and land a few successful visual gags - with Jack Black and Keegan-Michael Key, who plays Toad, clearly having a blast in their roles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's much-delayed The Settlers reboot has resurfaced once more, bringing with it a new name - it'll now be known as The Settlers: New Allies - and a 17th February 2023 release date on PC, with console versions to follow.


This latest release date marks Ubisoft's fourth attempt at getting its Settlers reboot out the door; when the publisher first revealed it was revisiting the series' much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula back in 2018, the reboot was expected to arrive in autumn the following year. That wasn't to be, though, and the game was first pushed into 2020 before being postponed indefinitely as summer 2020 rolled around.


It seemed like the end was finally in sight for patient The Settlers fans at the start of this year, however, when Ubisoft announced a new 17th March release date for its reboot - but, following less-than-stellar closed beta feedback, the publisher slammed on the breaks once more, only saying the game would instead launch at "a later date".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly readying to make a number of formal concessions to EU regulators investigating its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, including the guarantee Call of Duty will be availalble on PlayStation for the next ten years.


Call of Duty has remained a focal point during government scrutiny of Microsoft's Activision Blizzard deal, with regulators - including those in the UK and Europe - raising fears Microsoft may leverage the juggernaut franchise to gain an unfair advantage over its competition.


Reports in September revealed Microsoft had initially pledged to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for "at least several more years" beyond Activision's existing deal - an arrangement PlayStation boss Jim Ryan would go on to call "inadequate on many levels" - but as regulatory scrutiny deepened, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said the company would continue releasing Call of Duty on Sony's consoles for "as long as there's a PlayStation out there to ship to".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go has revealed details of its ninth season, Mythical Wishes, which will carry the game through the next three months: from 1st December to 1st March. 


Mythical Wishes is a reference to Hoenn's Mythical creature Jirachi, which has only appeared in Pokémon Go once previously. It looks set for a reappearance (and possible Shiny debut?) at 2023's Pokémon Go Tour event, which is set to be detailed fully tomorrow. More tangibly, today's new trailer also teases the release of Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre at the end - some of the most powerful creatures in the series, and a big deal for fans.


Hoenn creatures dominate much of the next season, with the introduction of the region's three Starter creatures in their Mega evolved forms: Mega Sceptile, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Swampert. The trio will debut via a Raid Day event this Saturday, 3rd December which will offer a number of extra free raid passes.

Single-player DLC for the game looks unlikely, and the bundled multiplayer offering Red Dead Online was pronounced "dead" by its community of players after developer Rockstar confirmed it would no longer push major updates to the game to shift development to Grand Theft Auto 6 instead.
That hasn't put people off enjoying Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, however (with some help from the Thanksgiving holidays across the pond and Steam's autumn sale).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision was kept busy over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend fixing a popular Call of Duty glitch which granted infinite money and weapon XP. 


The now-fixed exploit let you repeatedly sell weapons at the game's Buy Stations in exchange for XP. In a quick fix for the issue, XP from Buy Stations was nerfed to counter the number of people quickly levelling up their weapons. 


But, as fans quickly found, this still left the game's white dumpster Dead Drops as an option. This lasted another half day or so, until it too was countered by another behind the scenes change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Supermassive Games' Dark Pictures Anthology are unhappy at the long wait for what they see as crucial fixes to earlier games in the series. 


The horror franchise's first two titles - Man of Medan and Little Hope - were updated on 28th September with a spruce-up designed to introduce difficulty settings, QTE warnings and more accessibility options. Man of Medan even gained a "previously unseen" story chapter. 


But these updates also had the unintended consequence of introducing a raft of bugs to the games, with a number of players complaining of being unable to save or make progress past certain points.

However, it turns out that if you remove all of his hair (bar his eyebrows, thank goodness), he looks really quite different... and I am not sure that is a good thing.


As shared by prolific modder Speclizer, who recently unlocked God of War Ragnarök's unfinished photo mode, there is now a The Last of Us Part 2 mod that makes Joel's head and face almost as smooth as a baby's bottom.

In what was presumably an oversight from the developers at Game Freak - and not intentional - fans have found you can align your character and Meowscarada just a little too well, allowing for a kiss-like interaction when out picnicking.
Why would you want to kiss Meowscarada? Well, when its design leaked shortly before launch, people quickly made hordes of fan art, some of which was not particularly wholesome or Safe For Work.

This news is not surprising. Earlier reports revealed that Warner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav had spoken to the wider company about plans to "build a bible for a cohesive DC universe" that would include media such as "live-action films, TV, animation, gaming and more".

Starting with Kubernetes 1.25, our container image registry has changed from k8s.gcr.io to registry.k8s.io. This new registry spreads the load across multiple Cloud Providers & Regions, functioning as a sort of content delivery network (CDN) for Kubernetes container images. This change reduces the project’s reliance on a single entity and provides a faster download experience for a large number of users.
TL;DR: What you need to know about this change
Container images for Kubernetes releases from 1.25 onward are no longer published to k8s.gcr.io, only to registry.k8s.io.
In the upcoming December patch releases, the new registry domain default will be backported to all branches still in support (1.22, 1.23, 1.24).

As spotted by the eagle-eyed folks at Resetera, the fighting game - which, as yet, does not have a firm release date beyond a very vague "2023" window - has secured a 15 age rating due to its "expression of physical damage shown in illustrations in addition to basic fighting expression".

Whilst this doesn't necessarily mean that a release is just around the corner, it does intimate that it's probably set to drop in the next six months or so… and with The Game Awards just a few days away now, many fans are speculating that we may get that all-important release date then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yet another delay for its exceedingly long-in-the-works Dead Island 2, publisher Quick Silver has announced the zombie shooter sequel will be getting its first proper airing in quite some time on Tuesday, 6th December.


Dead Island 2 was, somewhat unbelievably, initially unveiled all the way back in 2014, promising more of the kind of co-operative zombie shooting action that had made developer Techland's enjoyable 2011 original a bit of a hit.


Since then, though, development has been turbulent, with the sequel missing its initially announcement 2015 release date and losing its original developer - Spec Ops: The Line studio Yager - that same year. Eight months later, British developer Sumo Digital was revealed to have taken over the project, but another studio switch was still to come when Homefront: The Revolution maker Dambuster Studios took the reins in 2019.

Tales from the Far Territory, as the new expansion is known, releases in six parts over the course of 12 months, each arriving approximately every 8-10 weeks. All six parts will focus on The Long Dark's much-loved Survival mode, but there are narrative elements in there and Hinterland is referring to the complete series as a "campaign".


Exactly what will be coming when is currently unclear, but Hinterland has now detailed all the major features it'll be introducing to Survival mode throughout the expansion. There are three new areas, for instance - the Forsaken Airfield, Industrial Mine, and Mountain Pass - all accessible via the Far Range Branchline and Transfer Pass hub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's barely been a week since American Truck Simulator thundered across the Texan border, but already SCS Software is setting course for a new destination, with the developer having now confirmed Oklahoma as the trucking sim's next DLC expansion.


Oklahoma will be American Truck Simulator's 12th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas - and its announcement isn't all that unexpected given SCS' continued left-to-right march across the US, and Oklahoma slotting so neatly above the recently released Texas.


"While Oklahoma tends to have an unfortunate reputation of being a rather arid place," SCS writes in its announcement post, "sometimes it's much better to avoid judging a book by its cover. The state is home to wonderful national parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends. And if you are looking for something more practical instead, the local road network and a strong economy will keep every trucker properly busy."

Fire starter Fuecoco has been branded as "broken" by proponents of Pokémon's "Nuzlocke" style of gameplay - the fan-invented method of playing Pokémon which essentially amounts to permadeath. 


Any Pokémon which faints in a Nuzlocke run is considered dead and must be released back into the wild. Additionally, you may only catch the first creature in any area and no other, severely limiting the number of Pokémon at your disposal.

Why yes, Witcher fans, this next-gen update will also include Netflix's take (at least for its first season) on the Nilfgaardian army's armour.

Activision falls under the latter category with what is possibly the most creative (or bizarre) tie-in I have ever seen. 


In Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2/Warzone 2.0, players can now vote on which team they think will win future matches. Those who guess correctly get 10,000 XP, that national team's flag as a Calling Card, oh and a remix of their national anthem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're discussing the PlayStation 6 - specifically, Sony's concerns about Call of Duty not being available on the upcoming platform, which we now know will debut sometime from 2027 onwards. 

It's been another week dominated by news of Microsoft's $68bn Activision Blizzard takeover attempt, which is currently being scrutinised by the UK's anti-competition regulator. Partially-redacted documentation from this process has now been made public, revealing some eyebrow-raising arguments from Sony - which is trying to block the deal. 
Both Sony and Microsoft have gone on the defensive to make themselves look the smaller fish - with Microsoft  admitting Sony's exclusives are better and Sony saying any loss of Call of Duty would leave itself "extremely vulnerable", particularly if the series was made available through the popular Xbox Game Pass. So, should Sony be worried - or is this all just performative theatrics? Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

Ghost's face has been one of Call of Duty's biggest mysteries since his introduction. Just who is it that hides behind that slightly unnerving facial covering? 


Well, this mystery is a mystery no more, as Ghost has - quite literally - been unmasked by Redditor Crafty-Astronomer905 (thanks PCGamesN).

The M13B Assault Rifle is contentiously locked behind a challenge in Warzone's DMZ mode and is a massive pain in the bottom to complete. 


However, players have also found a neat trick that means that only one person in your group of friends has to complete the challenge. That player can then "drop" the weapon for other members of the squad to pick up, extract, and unlock.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fresh details of the legal battle between Disco Elyisum creatives and their former bosses have emerged, as part of a hearing held in an Estonian court. 


To recap on the story so far: a trio of high profile staff behind the first Disco Elysium game were fired from developer ZA/UM following the company's takeover by Estonian businessmen Ilmar Kompus, who is now ZA/UM's boss and controlling shareholder, and Tõnis Haavel who was previously convicted of investment fraud. 


On the one side, some of the staff - including Disco Elysium game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov - have previously alleged that Kompus and Haavel's takeover was fraudulent, and that they were booted out when trying to discover more. On the other, Kompus and Haavel have claimed the firings were due to some staff creating a "toxic environment" - and they were allegedly planning to depart the studio anyway to try and build a Disco Elysium sequel elsewhere.

But while Soap is certainly a key part of the series, there are still some aspects of his persona that are left untold. Well, this list of unknown attributes just got a little shorter, thanks to his Modern Warfare 2 bio.


Here, it is revealed that Soap got his nickname not because he is fastidious in the shower, but because he is good at "cleaning house". In fact, this is something he does with "remarkable speed and accuracy in room clearance techniques and urban warfare tactics".

Making a statement on Twitter, Meservey said any notion the deal would be anticompetitive is "absurd" and that the "merger will benefit gamers and the US gaming industry - especially as we face stiffer competition from abroad".


This could be referring to moves made by Sweden's Embracer Group and China's Tencent to acquire more studios and IPs.

It then calls out the Battlefield series as a major rival, but says the franchise "cannot keep up".

Pokémon Violet and Scarlet have faced significant criticism since release - Digital Foundry called the games "comprehensive technical failures" - but that hasn't stopped them from smashing previous series entries' already considerable launch day records.


We already knew Violet and Scarlet were off to a flying start when charts firm GfK confirmed the pair were not only the UK's biggest boxed video game launch of the year, but the UK's second biggest boxed Pokémon launch of all time - only being beaten out by 3DS' Sun and Moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Striking Distance Studios has responded to the news its sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol's season pass will feature exclusive death animations, insisting these haven't been cut from the main game to sell for an additional fee.


As detailed on Steam, The Callisto Protocol's season pass consists of four components: the Outer Way Skin Collection, story DLC, a Riot Bundle featuring a new wave-based mode set in an "undiscovered area" of Black Iron Prison, and a permadeath mode included in the Contagion Bundle. Eyebrows were raised, however, with the news the latter two bundles would also add a total of 25 new death animations - 13 for protagonist Jacob and 12 for enemies.


Much of The Callisto Protocol’s pre-release publicity has focused on its myriad gruesome death animations as a key selling point - Striking Distance's CEO Glen Schofield discussed its "gore engine" with Eurogamer earlier this year - so there was a degree of incredulity when Striking Distance revealed more than two dozen of these would only be available to purchasers of the season pass, being sold as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition for an additional £20.

Splinter Cell's audio adaptation - officially titled Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Firewall - follows series protagonist and Fourth Echelon agent Sam Fisher on a mission to recruit and train the next generation of operatives for the National Security Agency's covert action division. "When a lethal assassin from Fisher's past returns from the dead on a mission of murder," the BBC teases, "he is thrust into a race against time as a sinister threat to global security is revealed."


Firewall stars Andonis Anthony (The Archers) as Sam Fisher, and Daisy Head as his daughter Sarah. Other cast members include Sacha Dhawan (Doctor Who, The Great), Will Poulter (Midsommer, Black Mirror), and Nikesh Patel (Starstruck, The Devil's Hour).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt's long-promised next-gen update for The Witcher 3 is almost upon us, and ahead of its PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC arrival on 14th December, the studio has shared a first look at the various enhancements it'll bring.


As far as technical improvements go, CD Projekt positively whistled through them during its first-look livestream, but PC players can expect to see support for the likes of raytracing, DLSS, and FSR, alongside a selection of new Ultra Plus graphics options, boosting background characters, level of detail, and more.


Indeed, there are visual touch-ups across the board, including a rework for grass and foliage, enhanced and more varied weather conditions, plus higher resolution textures and meshes throughout environments. Novigrad's cobblestones are no longer normal maps, for instance, and instead now fully 3D. Keen-eyed players will also see the likes of smoke drifting from chimneys in distant villages.

This crackdown has achieved "remarkable results", the China Game Industry Group Committee data provider CNG said, with more than 75 percent of all under-18s now claimed to be following the rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarök is off to a flying start, having sold 5.1m copies in its first week - making it officially the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation title to date.


PlayStation Studios head Herman Hulst shared the news on Twitter, thanking fans and congratulating God of War Ragnarök developer Sony Santa Monica for its "amazing achievement".


We already knew God of War Ragnarök was doing the numbers, of course - it set the day-one sales record for the franchise here in the UK - but Hulst's announcement confirmed it had also set a first-week sales record for the series around the world. By way of comparison, Ragnarök's immediate predecessor shifted 3.1m copies in its first three days back in 2018, beating out the previous record held by God of War 3 in 2010.

The partially-redacted document was released publicly today as part of the UK's ongoing in-depth Competition and Markets Authority review into Microsoft's proposed $68bn Activision Blizzard buyout - a deal Sony has strongly objected to. 


In an intriguing passage discussing the length of time Call of Duty may remain on PlayStation, Sony claims that (at the time of writing) it expected to lose access to the franchise in 2027. Sony then goes on to state that by the time it "launched the next generation of its PlayStation console... it would have lost access to Call of Duty and other Activision titles".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly nine months on from launch, Gran Turismo 7 has introduced one of its most heavily requested features, as the game's 1.26 update finally allows players to sell cars in their garage. 


The inability to sell vehicles was a key part of the criticisms aimed towards the PlayStation exclusive at launch, with a miserly economy and expensive microtransactions souring the experience for many. It's a bit baffling that it's taken so long, and there's still a little uncertainty precisely how it'll work and how good the payouts will be, but it does at least come as part of a generous update. 


The big addition that comes with the 1.26 patch is a track that's entirely new to Gran Turismo, and is something a bit special. Road Atlanta's a 2.5 mile circuit set in the north of the state of Georgia, and is one of the finest road courses in the USA. It plays host to the Petit Le Mans each year, a challenging race that makes the most of its undulations and whip-quick esses for one of the most punishing endurance races where 10 hours feels more like 100 (at least that's what it felt like the few times I've run its iRacing virtual equivalent).

Hotz shot to internet fame in 2008 for being the first to jailbreak the iPhone. Around a year later, he followed that feat by hacking the PlayStation 3 - and memorably rapped about Sony's subsequent attempts to sue him. The two sides ultimately settled matters outside of court.


Now, Hotz has agreed to join Musk at Twitter on a temporary work contract (something which seems wise).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a Santa descending from the heavens on a reindeer made of space, Hello Games has delved into its sack of procedural treats to give good No Man's Sky fans one final gift for 2022: another chance to play all four of this year's Expeditions and snag any goodies they might have missed the first time around.


Expeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are something like No Man's Sky's stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. And the rewards for completing each one are usually pretty neat, ranging from robot dog companions to your very own space whale.


And now Hello Games has confirmed it'll be re-running all four of 2022's Expedition starting this Thursday, 24th November. As was the case in last year's redux event, Expeditions will run in truncated form, each lasting for just two weeks before the next one rolls in - meaning players eager to acquire any rewards they might have missed (including those on Switch, who haven't had chance to play any of these yet) will have to work quick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tetris: The Grand Master, developer Arika's notoriously challenging arcade spin on the classic block-dropping puzzler, is making its long-awaited console debut next Thursday, 1st December, arriving on Switch and PlayStation.


Arika's The Grand Master series first appeared in Japanese arcades back in 1988, where it quickly gained a reputation for its difficulty, thanks to the rapid drop speed increase during play. It also features a grading system, ranking performance all the way up to Grand Master.


Several sequels followed, and the series eventually made the jump to home consoles in Japan with 2005's Tetris: The Grand Master Ace for Xbox 360 - which was to be its final release.

Dreamlight Valley players first got a look at the life-sim adventure's new Toy Story realm - a recreation of Andy's childhood bedroom, as seen in the movies - back in September, during the Disney & Marvel Games Showcase.


At the time, it was revealed players would be teaming up with Woody and Buzz for a "brand-new Toy Story adventure" when the realm released. A selection of Buzz and Woody inspired cosmetics were also teased, but full details of the update are still to be shared.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To celebrate the arrival of Civilization 6's Leader Pass on PC, Mac, and iOS, developer Firaxis has provided a more detailed breakdown of Abraham Lincoln, Queen Nzinga Mbande, and Sultan Saladin - the first of 18 leaders being introduced across six included DLC.


First up in the Leader Pass' inaugural DLC, known as the Great Negotiations Pack, is Abraham Lincoln, representing the United States. Lincoln abides by the Preserver of the Union agenda - meaning he only likes civilisations with the same form of government - and makes use of his Emancipation Proclamation ability, which has a number of different effects depending on the expansions players have installed.


Those with just the base game get +2 Amenities for Industrial Zones and their buildings, but receive -1 Amenities for Plantations. These numbers increase to +3 Amenities per turn and -2 Loyalty respectively when using the Rise and Fall & Gathering Storm DLCs.

You don't need to have progressed that far into the game to make these work, though you'll probably want a relatively high-level Pokémon to do some bidding for you.
I briefly tested the two methods currently making the rounds in the community, and whilst one worked for me, the other didn't. So be wary, your mileage may vary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today decided to launch an in-depth investigation into Apple and Google, looking at the restrictions set by each company that affect access to smartphone cloud gaming.


The move follows an earlier proposal to investigate the two companies' market power, and a year-long study of the iPhone and Android ecosystems. That report, published in June, determined Apple and Google held "an effective duopoly" over smartphone markets, allowing them to "exercise a stranglehold" over mobile operating systems, app stores and web browsers.


Further work by the CMA included consultations with unnamed "cloud gaming service providers", as well as web developers and browser makers, who said Apple and Google's approach was "harming their businesses, holding back innovation, and adding unnecessary costs". These concerns will be investigated further as part of a far-reaching "Phase 2" CMA investigation.

Also, if you're anything like me, you'll have rewatched yesterday's Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC Wave 3 trailer multiple times, trying to spot all the tweaks and additions to some of the many returning tracks. (And yes, that does sound like a newly-recorded version of Maple Treeway's score.)


Alongside yesterday's trailer I saw a generally warmer reception to the visuals in these latest additions than in some of the other DLC drops so far - which have been criticised by fans as not standing up to graphical quality seen in the base game. These DLC tracks are, by and large, taken from Mario Kart Tour - the series' smartphone spin-off - with an extra layer of polish attached.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a scheme that can only be matched by Team Star in its levels of nefariousness, players have found an exploit in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that lets you skip the game's first quest.
The intended sequence of the game would see you play through The First Day of School quest, which would then unlock all the other storylines in the game.
However, players have found a way to skip the latter section of the quest, allowing you to cut out the tedium of meeting your new classmates and teachers and get straight into exploring the open-world of Paldea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's World Cup is a little different, as I think we all understand. Amidst headlines on migrant worker conditions, LGBTQ+ rights and criticism of the tournament from both players and fans, it's been interesting to see how brands - and video games - are noting Qatar 2022.


Fortnite has a history with football - and its governing bodies. Some of its most popular skins are based on football kit designs, and the game's meme-like dances were a fixture of England's 2018 World Cup squad. Last year, Epic Games officially licensed the likenesses of England's Harry Kane and Germany's Marco Reus for the delayed 2020 Euros, and featured an in-game "UEFA Euro 2020 Cup" tournament with cash prizes. 


Prior to that, Fortnite has added skins wearing the officially-licensed football shirts of 23 top teams worldwide, including many from the Premiership. Fortnite also has an officially licensed Neymar Jr. skin, and an emote where you can punch the air that was launched in a collaboration with Pelé.

To put this figure into perspective, Warzone 1 reached 30 million players in 10 days. If Warzone 2 keeps up the same momentum, it is safe to assume it will soon exceed these figures.


Activision shared the news of this milestone on its social media feeds, thanking those who have taken part in its frenzied battlegrounds so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to the days of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and you may recall an infamous bug that allowed players to soar through the skies in a fashion that should not be not humanly possible. This became known as the 'Superman' exploit, due to the way the players looked when this glitch was in motion - positioned horizontally in a skydiving position.


And now, when playing Call of Duty's most recent offerings of Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, you may well see this move in play once more. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's just your teammate channelling their inner Clark Kent. 


Today's version of the Superman exploit was recently shared by prolific Warzone 2 player Wuqi. In a compilation, the gamer can be seen bouncing off certain points on the maps while diving in the air, giving them a soaring boost. This, as you can see below, allows them to cover ground a lot more quickly than the more traditional methods of traversal.

Sony's subscription service offered the PS4 version of Ys 8, alongside other titles in the series. Last week, a £35 PS5 version of the game launched, with no free upgrade option for fans with a PS4 copy already. 


It was around this time that the RPG's PS4 version disappeared from the PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue.

Crossplay and cross-progression have, of course, been available in Rainbow Six Siege for some time now, but only between PC, Stadia, and Luna. As of next month, though, that'll open out to incorporate PlayStation and Xbox, so console owners can take advantage of the features too.


From 6th December, console players can access their progress, currencies, and other items across all platforms simply by logging into their accounts. They can also team up with friends on other consoles via Ubisoft Connect, although it's possible to opt out of crossplay if preferred.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the launch of MultiVersus' second season last week, the free-to-play fighter's roster has now expanded once more, this time ushering in Looney Tunes' extraterrestrial extraordinaire Marvin the Martian.


Marvin's imminent arrival was teased last week as Season 2 got underway, but he officially joins the line-up today, bringing Multiversus' total number of playable fighters up to 23 - with Marvin joining recent additions such as Black Adam and Gremlins' Gizmo and Stripe.


Marvin can be unlocked with 3000 Gold, 1 Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium, and features three signature moves. There's his B-23 Bubble Blaster, giving players the power to launch bubble projectiles, and that's joined by his K-62 Projectile Modulator - basically a big red button that will reverse the direction of allied projectiles. Finally, Marvin can plant his flag into the ground, simultaneously claiming it for Mars and sending enemies skyward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As intense government scrutiny of Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard continues, with many regulatory bodies placing particular importance on the future of the Call of Duty franchise, Microsoft has told the New York Times it offered Sony a 10-year deal to keep the series on PlayStation earlier this month.


In total, 16 regulatory bodies around the world have launched investigations into Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard to assess its likely impact on competition. So far, only Brazil and Saudi Arabia have approved the deal, with a number of territories, including the European Commission and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, having announced more in-depth reviews of the matter.


In both those cases, Call of Duty's future has been highlighted as a particular concern, with regulators raising fears the juggernaut franchise may be leveraged by Microsoft to gain an unfair advantage over its competition.

All this started back in October when, following a patch update, The Sims 4 players began reporting their Sims were autonomously insulting friends, relatives, and passersby at an alarming frequency, causing havoc to their carefully curated stories.


Eventually, with insults continuing to fly and households lying in ruin, EA moved to acknowledge the issue, promising a fix would arrive as soon as its investigation was complete.

Rumours of the game's existence began in summer, when it was accidentally let slip by Windows Central. Speculation on a new Crash Bandicoot game increased when Toys for Bob teased their 18th game, and fans are expecting to see a new entry in the series announced at The Game Awards next month.

The prototype was leaked yesterday by YouTuber Liam Robertson, for reasons he described as "historical interest". A short snippet of gameplay is shown along with concept arts. Robertson reiterated throughout the video that the footage shown comes from a very early version of the project, and that it is "not representative of what the game could look like if it releases".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A former intern at Sony Santa Monica has said that their work on God of War Ragnarök had gone uncredited.


Sharing her story on Twitter, composer Jessica Mao stated she "worked on the editing/arrangement/implementation of the Freya chase scene" as well as the "Thor boss fight music".


However, despite her input, Mao said her name was not included in the game's end credits as her contribution to Ragnarök didn't hit the "minimum criteria"  required (although Mao is unsure what "this criteria could be").

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend's big releases were Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and the internet has done a lot of talking about them. For reasons.
The game's current state is far from perfect, leading to plenty of glitches, jankiness and sometimes full on Bethesda-level comedy horror.
Personally, I picked up the game precisely for that experience (I am having fun playing the game also!) but sadly I've not encountered anything funkier than a T-pose during my time with Violet so far. Luckily for me, there are countless other people who've been sharing their witness accounts on Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its release just shy of two weeks ago, there has been a lot of chatter about God of War Ragnarök. This has ranged from whether or not there should be a PETA friendly mode included in the game, to Kratos' atonement for his past behaviour.


One thing that has really struck a chord is the amount of help Ragnarök's companions give when players are trying to solve puzzles. Many fans feel that, really, it would be better if said companions just held on to their advice for that little bit longer than they ultimately choose to. 


For example, much like many others, I like to venture off the game's main path every so often to see if there are any treasures tucked away I could miss if I left the area too soon. (This is all just standard exploration, not a sign that I don't have a clue what I am doing. Honestly, it is.) Early on in the game I took one step away from Atreus and was swiftly told I was going the wrong way. "I think this wheel over here needs to turn," he called after my retreating footsteps.

Responding to a fan who asked why so few characters from the franchise's less-popular 3D-era are seen in recent games, Boon stated: "That is something we will soon fix."

<p>&#8220;If we can recover the RSA-512 Public Key from the registry, we can crack it and get the 256-bit AES Key that encrypts the files!&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;The challenge was that they delete the [public key] once the files are fully encrypted. Memory analysis gave us about a 5-minute window after files were encrypted to retrieve this public key.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

This is why Switch game images have appeared on the site, which has since received a DMCA takedown notice, Games Radar reported.

This has also won Scarlet and Violet the title of being the UK's second biggest boxed Pokémon launch of all time. The biggest is still that of the 3DS's Sun and Moon (although, due to sale prices, charts firm GfK states Scarlet and Violet has generated more money than Sun and Moon did during its launch week). 


Per GamesIndustry.biz, the first week of sales for Scarlet and Violet (at least physically, as Nintendo does not share digital sales) are 25 percent bigger than those of Sword and Shield, 70 percent bigger than the Diamond and Pearl remakes and 56 percent bigger than this year's other big Pokémon offering, Arceus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Warzone 2.0 bug is seemingly making some players invisible.

This latest glitch - which some may remember also briefly caused havoc in the original Warzone game - came to light over the weekend after players took to Reddit and social media with clips of them being taken out by players they cannot see. Literally.

As spotted by GamesRadar+, the newly released mod - simply called "Remove Sheeran" - does exactly what it says on the tin, deleting Sheeran's tracks from the credits and replacing it with a track from the late notable Japanese singer, Wada Koji.

"Removes Ed Sheeran from the game and replaces him with Wada Koji (may he rest in peace)," explains the mod's creator, before adding that as they only own Violet, the mod has yet to be tested on Scarlet. It should still work, though.
