They include notes and annotations handwritten by Barone that intimate how he expected players to interact with the different characters and items in the game.

"[I] was going through some things and found my old notebook with the original community centre concept," Barone tweeted, before sharing wonderful sketches taken from his original notebook.

"Deathhaze Gloombeak soars into Akikure Canyon, along with a new title and a new talisman skill for those able to reach new heights as a hunter. Serial Hunts – a new kind of Special Quest – have also been added, and could very well be the most arduous challenge Azuma’s hunters have seen to date."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four more Ubisoft games are slated to join Steam later this year.

Far Cry 6, Riders Republic, Rainbow Six Extraction, and Monopoly Madness are set to come to the Steam store on 11th May, 8th June, 15th June, and 22nd June, respectively, marking the first time these titles will be playable on Steam.

Since 2019, Ubisoft had skipped bringing its game to Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12 per cent revenue cut compared to Valve's 30 per cent.

The smash-hit indie horror hit – which offers some genuinely unsettling moments in its 10ish hour run time over numerous playthroughs – doesn't seem to boast any Switch-specific features, but it does mark the first time the chilling creeper is available outside of Steam.

"Having completed your degree in mortuary sciences, you have taken on an apprenticeship at River Fields Mortuary. Over the past several months you have logged many hours aiding the Mortician in daily tasks along with learning the ins and outs of the embalming process as well as how to properly handle and care for the deceased," teases the description on the Nintendo Shop.

All this comes via Sons of the Forest's patch #4, which, while fairly light on radical new features, brings a host of welcome quality of life improvements - including the aforementioned Kelvin buff meaning he can now carry a whopping two logs at once - plus tweaks, and more. 


There's some new stuff on the feature front, though, including a new Action Cam used to view Sons of the Forest's found footage tapes - the first of which is now in-game - plus new points of interest discovery laptops, and the ability to name save games.

There's a lot going on in Relics of the Old Faith, as the update is known, starting with the introduction of Relics and heavy attacks as part of Cult of the Lamb's improved combat. It also adds remixed dungeons featuring revamped enemies and bosses, including new versions of the base game's four Guardian Bishops as confirmed during Nintendo's indie showcase.


Away from the dungeon-crawling side of things, Massive Monster says the game's cult management portion will get new followers, plus a range of new buildings - including a kitchen with its own chef for more efficient cooking, a (non-collapsing) shared shelter capable of housing up to three followers, a crypt to keep graveyard sizes under control, plus farm plot signs which followers can plant stuff around for better crop organisation.

Voice of the People's main new feature is introduction of ideological "agitators" from across history, including Victor Hugo and Karl Marx. Agitators are a new kind of character in Victoria 3, capable of rallying pops to support political movements that align with their ideology.


"Agitators will shake up your internal politics, acting independently of their Interest Groups," Paradox explains in a blog post accompanying its DLC announcement. "Amplifying power from below, Agitators serve an opposite function to Interest Group Petitions which reflect the demands of the political elite. Depending on how your goals align with theirs, Agitators might be a painful thorn in your side or a valuable ally to your political agenda."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox's Aaron Greenberg has insisted Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush was a "break out hit" amid claims the critically acclaimed music adventure "just didn't make the money it needed to make".


The claim Hi-Fi Rush had failed to meet Microsoft's financial expectations was made by Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb during his latest Game Mess Decides podcast.

"Based on what I've heard," Grubb said during a conversation about the game's release strategy, "it just straight up didn't make the money it needed to make. I mean it got good reviews, the buzz was good, so where do you put the blame for something like that? Is it the price? Was it the shadow drop? Could it have sold more? Or is it Game Pass?".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darker and Darker's lawyer has accused Korean gaming company Nexon of "anti-competitive bully tactics", in a letter to Steam owner Valve. 


Following positive reception at Steam Next Fest earlier this year, Dark and Darker has experienced a troubled production. In March, developer Ironmace had its office searched, after Nexon alleged the studio created its game with code stolen from Nexon's own "P3" project (something several members of Ironmace's team had previously worked on). 


Soon after these allegations were made, Nexon issued Ironmace with a cease and desist demand, and Dark and Darker was removed from Steam. Most recently, it came to light that the Dark and Darker developer is being sued by Nexon for "copyright infringement", with the Korean game publisher demanding a jury trial in America.

It expands the map and makes meaningful gameplay, matchmaking and user interface changes, among many other things.

While the core objectives of the game are the same, with lanes the same distance from each other and win objectives still in the centre of the map, there's 40 percent more terrain, which means there's loads of room to gather resources.

Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature called Node log query that allows
viewing logs of services running on the node.
What problem does it solve?
Cluster administrators face issues when debugging malfunctioning services
running on the node. They usually have to SSH or RDP into the node to view the
logs of the service to debug the issue. The Node log query feature helps with
this scenario by allowing the cluster administrator to view the logs using
kubectl. This is especially useful with Windows nodes where you run into the
issue of the node going to the ready state but containers not coming up due to
CNI misconfigurations and other issues that are not easily identifiable by
looking at the Pod status.
How does it work?

Specifically, Atari's new acquisitions span the PC and console game catalogues of publishers Micropose, Infogrames, Accolade, with Atari also now owning the Accolade trademark.


Sadly, the company hasn't shared a full list of the retro IP it now owns after its most recent splurge, so there'll be no time for lengthy bouts of nostalgia here - but its announcement did at least call out the aforementioned Bubsy and Demolition Racer, alongside Hardball, 1942: Pacific Air War, F-117A, and F-14 air combat series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dazzlingly chaotic crowd puzzler Humanity, which is being developed by Tokyo game studio THA in collaboration Tetris Effect developer Enhance, will be tumbling onto PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC on 16th May, and it'll be a day one PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue addition too.


Humanity, if you're unfamiliar, has been in development for a fair old while, with THA first showcasing the game back in 2017 before it re-emerged two years later with Enhance attached. It's remained an intriguing proposition throughout its journey, challenging players - in the role of a Shiba Inu - to corral huge, purposeless crowds.


There's a vague air of classic puzzler Lemmings about the whole thing as players let out a "woof" to control Humanity's vast swarms, making the crowds move, change direction, jump, float, or even fight in order to navigate Trials packed with traps and obstacles, and overcome enemies known as the Others.

Originally announced in May 2021, Heartland has now been in closed testing for over a year already - but there's evidently still more to be done before it gets a final launch date. 


Tonight, Ubisoft directed interested players and their parties to register for access (at thedivisionheartland.com) in a fresh round of testing, ahead of "more news this summer".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lone Echo developer Ready at Dawn has reportedly been heavily affected by the latest round of job cuts at Meta Quest and VR owner Meta, with one employee claiming a third of the studio has been laid off, including the studio head.


As originally reported by The Washington Post, today's layoffs could affect as many as 4,000 employees at Meta, and are part of the company's stated goal of cutting a further 10,000 jobs in 2023 following the 11,000 job losses announced last year.


The Washington Post claims Meta has targeted "highly skilled staff" - including engineers and other technical workers - in its latest round of layoffs, and, since its report, employees have said both Ready at Dawn and fellow Meta acquisition Downpour Interactive have been impacted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spooky visual novel Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is steeped in Japanese history. When you're not absorbing the sights of 1980s Tokyo or hearing ancient folk tales, Paranormasight feeds you bits of information about Japan during the wider Shōwa era and the earlier Edo period.


Whether from decades or centuries ago, elements of Japanese history are woven into the game, something which Paranormasight director and writer Takaya Ishiyama told me more about, in a discussion which revealed more about the team's approach to using history in the game's narrative as a way to balance realism and mystery.


One of the first things you notice when playing Paranormasight is the difference in visual style between the environments and the characters. The game's cast were drawn by Kobayashi Gen, and his distinct style stands out from the surroundings in-game. The 360-degree panoramas you explore were all created from photographs, though this wasn't initially what the team set out to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast it's all about Zelda, and the many burning questions we still have surrounding the upcoming Tears of the Kingdom. 

Despite all the details to be found in Nintendo's final Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, there's still so much we don't know.  How much has changed in Hyrule since Breath of the Wild, and how many new areas are there to explore? Are there proper dungeons in the game this time around? What are the Tears of the Kingdom? 
With less than a month until launch, it's time for one final round of theorising - as the internet begins to entertain some wild theories that Ganon is actually good, or maybe just pulling a Thanos. Joining me to discuss it all - and place bets on whether Zelda really is playable - are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

Last week, Season 3 of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 went live alongside a bundle that includes controversial "bonus effects" for the extraction mode, DMZ.

For example, the Classic Ghost Pack, which costs 2400 CP, includes a free two-plate armour vest, a 15-minute insured weapon cooldown for each of the two guns included in the bundle, and adds one more active duty operator slot for DMZ.

However, fast forward six months and we now have an official trailer for the game. It's called Unrecord, and comes from a developer known simply as Drama.


Unrecord is described as a "single-player FPS that tells the story of a tactical police officer from the perspective of his body camera". You can see how it looks for yourself below - and its realism makes for slightly uncomfortable viewing.

For the first time, high quality scans of the artwork are being shared with the Pokémon community in the hopes of archiving them.

The drawings depict the first 251 Pokémon to appear in the games and were uploaded by YouTuber and Pokémon archivist LewTwo to Twitter. The scans were sent to Lewtwo by Twitter user ExcaliburZero_Z.

The old scans are believed to have originated from the Pokémon Red and Blue Player's Guide, Lewtwo explained, where they ended up with "inaccurate colors, were often misshapen, and generally very low quality".

Please note, there are spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.


During the events of Burning Shores, Aloy meets Seyka, an "ambitious marine of the Quen tribe who has stepped up to help her people survive". Ahead of the DLC's release, Seyka was touted as a character that would be Aloy's equal, with actress Ashley Birch even saying "Aloy may have met her match".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Mario character who appears in the new Super Mario Bros. Movie will be re-named in Japan, Nintendo has confirmed. 


Mario and Luigi's former boss Spike appears in the film as a stern foreman and rival for the brothers' new firm. The character is a deep cut from Mario canon, and originally appeared in the NES and arcade game Wrecking Crew back in the 1980s.


In Japan, Spike has always had the name "Blackie" - which for obvious reasons will no longer be used. Henceforth, the character will be re-named as "Spike" in any future appearances, and the Japanese dub of the Super Mario Bros. Movie will use "Spike" as well.

Quote tweeting a Twitter user's call for more Diablo 4 game time, the official Diablo Twitter account said: "That can be arranged…"


That's a pretty clear tease that some surprise way to play Diablo 4 ahead of release is planned. Whether that's a fresh open beta or early access remains to be seen. If you pre-order Diablo 4 you currently get early access from 2nd June, so this tweet suggests something even earlier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author: Chris Henzie (Google)
With the release of Kubernetes v1.27 the ReadWriteOncePod feature has graduated
to beta. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at this feature, what it
does, and how it has evolved in the beta release.
What is ReadWriteOncePod?
ReadWriteOncePod is a new access mode for
PersistentVolumes (PVs)
and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
introduced in Kubernetes v1.22. This access mode enables you to restrict volume
access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to
the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads
that require single-writer access to storage.
For more context on access modes and how ReadWriteOncePod works read

The original Blasphemous released back in 2019 to well-deserved acclaim, delivering a rock-solid 2D Metroidvania-meets-Souls-like that married a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling baroque imagery.


In its upcoming sequel, Blasphemous' original pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One returns for another adventure - tying into the first game's Wounds of Eventide update ending - set across a strange new labyrinthine land ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

Announced back in 2021 and initially expected to launch that same year, Oxenfree 2 is set five years after the memorable, dimension-shattering events of the original game. This time around, the story focuses on new protagonist Riley Poverly, an environmental researcher who returns to her small coastal hometown of Camena which, as you might already have guessed, is being plagued by mysterious radio signals.


Making matters worse, there's a cult on the loose, attempting to open a portal between worlds, but Riley has some useful new tricks to help her investigations. A new walkie talkie, for instance, means communiucation can occur between characters all across Camena even when they're not together, with conversation and dialogue choices affecting how events play out.

As a reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release in March, before its launch was delayed. In a bizarre series of events, it transpired that Fntastic had failed to trademark the game's name, which had since been contested by the company behind a calendar app. All traces of the game were subsequently removed from Steam and since then, very little has been heard at all.


The Day Before has now reemerged, however, with word from an administrator on the game's official Discord that a beta is now in the pipeline.

Monster Hunter Rise's Title Update 5 (also referred to as Version 15) launches tomorrow, 20th April, and its flagship new arrival is the Looming Calamity, better known as the elder dragon Amatsu. This formidable creature can control the weather, conjuring violent storms and lightning strikes once it shows its true power, and is available to hunters at MR 10 or higher.


Amatsu is accompanied by Title Update 5's second creature addition, a powerful Risen variant Shagaru Magala, which becomes available at MR 180 or higher. As you'd expect, new equipment can be forged from the materials dropped by both creatures, including a fetching bit of Palamute outfit resembling floating armoured horse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Pokémon fan has created an impressive HD-2D take on the series' original Game Boy games.


Several videos made by 3D pixel artist and designer Dott have surfaced in the past week, showing off what Pokémon Red might look like if reimagined in an HD-2D style similar to recent Square Enix titles like Triangle Strategy and Octopath Traveler.

So, here are some of the current Tears of the Kingdom theories out there. (Beware elements that could be considered minor spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guerrilla has released a new patch for Horizon Forbidden West which adds a range of new accessibility features - including one designed for those who suffer from thalassophobia.


Thalassophobia is classed as the persistent and intense fear of deep bodies of water, including the sea, oceans and even lakes. It is different from aquaphobia, which is a fear of water itself.


According to Guerrilla, this option aims to ease a player's thalassophobia by "improving underwater ambient visibility". Additionally, Aloy will be able to breathe indefinitely when under the water "regardless of story progression".

The exuberant Jack Black ballad, in character as Bowser, is a highight of the film, and the catchiest movie track since Encanto's Bruno. I even heard it being chanted by the younger viewers around me as I left the cinema. 


It's also now hit the US song charts as well, and has marked Black's first solo entry in the Billboard Hot 100. On YouTube, meanwhile, the song's music video has racked up 17m views in 11 days. Let's watch:

Ubisoft has issued a raft of updates to the beta in a bid to improve the experience. My own time with the game on PlayStation 5 has been beset with technical issues that have forced me to restart in order to get a match. Ubisoft reacted to progression problems by unlocking everything for all players.

Playdate was initially announced back in 2019, promising a unique (and dinkily adorable) spin on portable gaming that would see Panic teaming up with a host of noted indie game designers - including the likes of Zach Gage and Bennett Foddy - to produce a curated 24-game "season", as well as offering itch.io sideloading support and, more recently, an on-device store.


It was a pitch that clearly captured peoples' imaginations; Panic has now revealed the initial 20,000 Playdate units it produced based on its early sales predictions sold out within 20 minutes of the device being made available to purchase via a queue system last April.

The problem
On Linux with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled, it's traditionally
the container runtime that applies SELinux labels to a Pod and all its volumes.
Kubernetes only passes the SELinux label from a Pod's securityContext fields
to the container runtime.
The container runtime then recursively changes SELinux label on all files that
are visible to the Pod's containers. This can be time-consuming if there are
many files on the volume, especially when the volume is on a remote filesystem.
Note
subPath of a volume, only that subPath of the whole
volume is relabeled. This allows two pods that have two different SELinux labels
to use the same volume, as long as they use different subpaths of it.

If a Pod does not have any SELinux label assigned in …]]></summary>

With spring now in full swing, green-fingered sorts will have the seasonally appropriate opporunity to fashion their own horticultural hangouts as part of The Sims 4's new Greenhouse Haven Kit. This introduces glass pane windows and doors that can be connected to create new garden spaces, as well as a range of items to go inside - including hanging baskets, starter seedlings, a planting table, and range of pots.


Alternatively, for those who'd prefer to hide away from the sun's rays in grungy comfort, there's the Basement Treasures Kit, offering a selection of hand-me-down inspired furnishings. Expect the likes of worn and torn chairs and couches, crates of vinyl records, old trophies and family photos, battered chests, and  even an old cathode-ray tube TV.

Now, by run, I mean actual running. One foot in front of the other and all that. And to add that extra layer of adventure and excitement, the app 'gamifies' your run by popping Marvel's heroes in your ear as they join you via the app's interactive stories. That said, you can also walk or jog (or perhaps even trot) your way through the storylines if you prefer.

Movie (which is now the biggest video game adaptation ever). Perhaps this isn't a huge surprise - after all, when I saw the film over the weekend, several Switch game trailers played before the movie began, including one for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.


Mario Kart 8: Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey and New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe all made the UK physical chart top 10 this week, with Mario Kart 8: Deluxe currently sitting at number two, only behind Fifa 23. This is a climb of two places for Nintendo's racer, which has seen a nine percent increase in sales week-on-week (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz)


As for the other two, Super Mario Odyssey jumped from tenth to fifth position this week, while New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe climbed from 17 to ten.

The "Automap" tool is a feature of the previous Diablo games. In Diablo 1 and 2 it appears as a faint overlay in the middle of the screen. Diablo 3 shifted the overlay map to the top right-hand corner of the screen, making it more of a mini-map.


Diablo 4, however, has a dedicated mini-map on the top-right corner of the screen, with the tab button used to display the full map and journal. The game will not have a tab overlay map as seen in Diablo 1 and 2, Diablo chief Rod Fergusson confirmed on Twitter.

In a recent blog, developer Dambuster Studios stated that, due to Dead Island 2's graphic requirements, "the host must play on the latest generation console (PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X S) or one of the Generation 8+ consoles (PlayStation 4 Pro/Xbox One X)". The host can then be joined by up to two more players. 


As such, those on original PS4 and Xbox One consoles will not be able to host a session on the game's launch. The developer is working on a solution for this, with the plan being that everyone playing Dead Island 2 will eventually be able to host a session, regardless of console. Dambuster has not given a timeframe for this update as yet, merely stating it is planned to come "in the future".

The issue first came to light last week, when Bungie said it had suffered a "breach of trust" after identifying a leaker amongst the small group of community members it sometimes invited to its studio to provide feedback on the game and share upcoming plans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having teased the introduction of difficulty modifiers to its viking survival game Valheim back in January, developer Iron Gate Studio has now offered a first look at the feature's progress.


Word that Iron Gate was looking to introduce difficulty settings to Valheim first came as part of an very early glimpse at the game's upcoming Ashlands biome. And now, three months on, development has reached a point where the studio is able to share more.


As detailed by Iron Gate's Jonathan Smårs on Twitter, Valheim's difficulty settings will take the form of both pre-set and customisable "world modifiers". Some you'd expect - Easy, Hard, and Hardcore variations are all present and correct, for instance, impacting combat difficulty, the frequency of enemy raids on player bases, and items kept on death - but Iron Gate is throwing in a number of more unusual presets too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A French court has sided with Nintendo in an appeal launched by filehosting website operator Dstorarge, which was previously ordered to pay €935,500 (around £826k) after it refused to withdraw access to pirated Nintendo games.


Nintendo initially took legal action against Dstorarge after it ignored copyright notifications demanding it remove illegal copies of Nintendo games hosted on its 1fichier service. The Judicial Court of Paris ultimately ruled in Nintendo's favour, saying filehosting services such as 1fichier were responsible for blocking access to pirated content and ordering Dstorage pay the Mario maker €935,500 in damages.


Dstorage, in turn, launched an appeal against the ruling, and, two years on, that appeal has now failed. The Paris Court of Appeals has once again sided with Nintendo, ordering Dstorage to pay the company €442,750 (£391k) in compensation, plus €25,000 (£22k) to cover legal fees.

Staten has been closely associated with the Halo series since 2000, serving in various roles across both Bungie and 343 Industries. He started out as writer and director of cinematics for Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2, and would become Halo Infinite's head of creative in 2020.


Word of his departure from 343 Industries arrived in January, amid extensive layoffs at Xbox Studios, when it was reported he would remain at Microsoft in a creative director role. Earlier this month, however, Staten confirmed he had now left Microsoft entirely, only saying he was preparing to embark on a "new adventure".

Healey co-founded Media Molecule in 2006 in Guildford alongside Kareem Ettouney, Alex Evans and David Smith, after working at Fable developer Lionhead (and creating Rag Doll Kung Fu, the first non-Valve game on Steam). Media Molecule's first game was 2008 PlayStation 3 user-generated content platformer LittleBigPlanet, which did well enough that Sony bought the company two years later in 2010.


Healey went on to work on 2011's LittleBigPlanet 2, 2013's Tearaway and, most recently, PlayStation 4 game Dreams.

One of those was boredom with dungeons, particularly in having to traipse back and forth across them. "One of the most common pieces of feedback we received is that players felt they were doing a lot of backtracking within certain dungeons," the company said in a blog post. "We have optimised multiple dungeons across all zones to minimise the need for backtracking."
In Fractured Peaks alone - the zone in the demo - nine dungeons have had their layouts changed. And wherever a dungeon has an objective, especially one you have to carry around, there are now movement speed buffs as well as other enhancements to keep the pace up.

Without going into too much detail, the footage shows Dead Island 2's opening sequence and cinematics. There's some general (and to be honest, expected) blood and gore. The stream also shows off some of the game's user interfaces and locations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog has released another update for The Last of Us Part 1 on PC, known as patch 1.0.3.


The developer has been doing its utmost to fix the game, which infamously released in an incredibly broken state earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie is clamping down on Destiny 2 cheaters, revealing that "people who abuse tools specifically to gain an advantage over players" will be banned.

In the latest TWAB post, the studio said that the issue had been "a matter of extended conversations both internally and in the community", and was keen "to strike the right balance between Bungie’s goal of simultaneously enabling everyone to enjoy our games and protecting our community".

"Our community has grown increasingly frustrated by a form of cheating that uses third-party peripherals with the intent to manipulate the game client," the team said. "These devices are plugged into a computer or console, where they can - for example - execute simple scripts or trick the game into giving you extra aim assist.

<p>The article answers a vexing question:</p>
<blockquote><p>So why do we always hear about the giant squid and not the colossal squid?</p>
<p>Well, part of it has to do with the fact that the giant squid was discovered and studied long before the colossal squid.</p>
<p>Scientists have been studying giant squid since the 1800s, while the colossal squid wasn&#8217;t even discovered until 1925.</p>
<p>And its first discovery was just the head and arms found in a sperm whale&#8217;s stomach.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until 1981 that the first whole animal was found by a trawler near the coast of Antarctica...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's probably fair to say Daedelic Entertainment's The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been a little divisive since its unveiling in 2019, and it likely won't help that the developer has now announced it's charging extra for anyone that wants to hear its elves speak in authentic Elvish.


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, for the uninitiated, forges something of a unusual path through Middle-earth, taking its wide-eyed lead - already an unusual choice for a protagonist - on a pre-Lord of the Rings adventure combining "subtle tactical stealth" and "fast-paced parkour action".


Perhaps a little oddly, given you'd think Daedelic would want to keep The Lord of the Rings fans firmly on its side, the developer has now announced those wanting to experience the adventure with more authentic elf voice acting "in the Elvish tongue of Sindarin" - an addition the developer is aiming at "die-hard fans who want to immerse themselves even more while exploring the world of Tolkien" - will need to cough up extra for Gollum's Precious Edition.

That's according to Variety, which reports The Super Mario Bros. Movie has now surpassed $500m at the global box office, with $260m of that coming from US ticket sales and $248m of its record-breaking take earned internationally.


Previous reports had placed The Super Mario Bros. Movie as having had the biggest opening of any video game adaptation ever, but latest figures push that even further, making it the highest grossing video game adaptation of all time, surpassing the surprisingly successful Warcraft movie ($439m), Detective Pikachu ($433m), and Rampage ($428m).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark and Darker studio Ironmace Games has asked players to torrent the mediaeval extraction looter's latest build following its delisting from Steam last month amid ongoing legal woes.


Dark and Darker had a bit of a moment when its third playlest gained more than 100,000 concurrent players during Steam's Next Fest back in February, but that initial success soon took a turn when Ironmace was accused of making its game "using materials and assets they worked on during their time" at developer Nexon.


Although Ironmace has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, the studio was subjected to a police raid in response to those accusations and Dark and Darker's Steam listing was ultimately removed following a cease and and desist demand from Nexon. At the time, Ironmace said it was working with its legal team to remedy the issue.

Today's episode also features our first glimpse at an all-new Pokémon species not yet available in any game - a baby turtle, which remains unnamed (thanks, Serebii).

Company of Heroes 3 marks the first time the celebrated series has made the jump to consoles, and arrives on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the PC version's features - including its two solo campaigns and various multiplayer modes - intact, aside from a couple of omissions.


As explained in Relic's Company of Heroes 3 FAQ, the console edition omits the PC version's in-game store, Challenges, and mod support. However, it does feature some console-specific tweaks, including full controller support, a custom UI designed specifically for gamepads, plus a number of features enabling console players to tackle the game "at their own pace".

A wheel that&#8217;s even marginally tilted could develop what Barnett called a &#8216;drop zone.&#8217; When the tilt forces the ball to climb a slope, the ball decelerates and falls from the outer rim at the same spot on almost every spin. A similar thing can happen on equipment worn from repeated use, or if a croupier&#8217;s hand lotion has left residue, or for a dizzying number of other reasons. A drop zone is the Achilles&#8217; heel of roulette.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peppa Pig: World Adventures gives players the chance to explore the globe, but perhaps its most memorable moment comes from its section set in London. There, players can meet England's late Queen, in a playful sequence which sees the monarch ride a bus around the capital before joining Peppa and friends in a spot of puddle jumping (everyone loves jumping in muddy puddles, you know). 


This particular section of the game became widely-shared online soon after Word Adventures released thanks to a viral clip showing the game's unexpected In Memoriam tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, which pops up at the end of the London chapter. 

Following the chapter's conclusion, the screen fades to black and the words: "HM Queen Elizabeth II, 1926-2022 In Memoriam" appear on screen, alongside an image of the late Queen,  mid-puddle splash with Peppa.

Mercer shared the news via Twitter last night, and called the role an "an immense honour" he has "thrown [himself] into doing justice" to. 


Alongside this announcement, Mercer also shared images of him cosplaying as Link when he was a child, and one of him more recently as Ganondorf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming TV ad for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has leaked, giving us a glimpse at a few more, previously unknown, details. 


Beware elements that could be considered minor spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.


The video, which popped up last night on reddit, is a TV spot for Nintendo's sequel, likely planned for the game's launch next month. Some of the footage we have seen before, such as Link using Ultrahand to build a Hylian hovercraft, but there are some small glimpses of new things I will detail below.

Released under the EA Originals label, Immortals of Aveum is a flashy-looking fantasy first-person shooter where you wield magic instead of guns.


Today brings a new trailer (below) with some pretty-looking cutscenes and some chaotic looking gameplay sections that are, frankly, a blur of neon particle effects, as the player fires out spells and conjurs up a magical shield.

For those who have followed previous reports and the recent PAX East presentation, this State of Play didn't offer any new details beyond putting the world, characters and Eikon battles into context. 


But the presentation was aimed instead at PlayStation owners and newcomers to the series. After all, this is Sony's big PlayStation exclusive for the near future, arriving on 22nd June worldwide. Check out the presentation below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic has revealed the next batch of weekly freebies heading to the Epic Games Store, with developer E-Line Media's BAFTA-winning Never Alone and its acclaimed oceanic follow-up Beyond Blue both set to go free next Thursday, 20th April.


Never Alone (also known as Kisima Ingitchuna) tells the tale of an Iñupiat girl named Nuna and her Arctic fox as they search for the source of an eternal blizzard in order to save their village from starvation - a quest presented as a narrative platformer playable both solo and in co-op.


While an enjoyable adventure in its own right, Never Alone is perhaps equally notable for its educational elements, with the game - which was made in collaboration with the Iñupiat community and narrated by a storyteller in the spoken Iñupiaq language - incorporating videos of the Alaska Native community sharing stories of their culture and the Arctic world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports last month that Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice would be delayed again, Warner Bros. has made it official - and then some - pushing the Batman Arkham Knight follow-up's release all the way back to 2nd February 2024.


This does, of course, mark the second substantial delay for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice, which was initially expected to arrive in 2022 before Warner Bros. made the decision to shift its launch to 26th May this year in order to "make the best game we can".


Rumours Warner Bros. was having another change of heart first emerged at the end of March, when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier and Windows Central's Jez Corden reported Suicide Squad was now targeting a later release, after an extended PlayStation State of Play reveal in February was met with a less-than-enthusiastic reception from fans - with with many lamenting its uninspired action and live-service trappings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe's wonderfully weird new expansion The Duviri Paradox finally has a release date, and is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on Wednesday, 26th April.


The Duviri Paradox, if you're unfamiliar, is quite a departure for Warframe. Not only does its new open-world area, Duviri - perhaps most notable for the fact it exists inside the mind of the expansion's new big bad, Dominus Thrax - trade sci-fi for something closer to a fantasy western, it also propels the long-running free-to-play shooter into the realm of roguelikes.


Cast as a Drifter sentenced to death at the start of the expansion's story (which newcomers can select as an alternative introduction to Warframe), players are soon liberated by the mysterious rewind-on-death power that forms the core of the roguelike-inspired experience. Before long, they'll gain a fancy skeletal steed and a random assortment of perk-like Decrees, both proving invaluable as they set about restoring colour to a world shaped by the moods of its master.

Digital advertising branded with Xbox and Microsoft logos have been spotted with the following message: "Call of Duty. For 150 million more players."


As spotted by Tom Warren, the advert comes a month after Microsoft previously published full-page adverts in the UK's Financial Times and Daily Mail with the same phrasing, and a claim Microsoft's bid to "unite Activision Blizzard and Xbox" would deliver "more games, for more players on more platforms".

After years of wait, we're now less than a month away from Tears of the Kingdom's arrival - and there's still so much we don't know about the game itself.

A new 73-page missive by the self-proclaimed gamers includes fresh details they say have been taken from redacted documents given "directly to the board of directors" at Microsoft, as well as information given by Sony.


In a statement to Reuters, Microsoft said this latest complaint was based on "unsupported and implausible claims about the deal's effect on competition". Microsoft said it will "bring more games to more people" through its proposed deal with Activision.

That's according to PC Gamer, which stated this update will shrink the files by "approximately" 60 percent.


Just quickly for those who, like me, aren't as technologically minded as others: Steam Decks come in set sizes in terms of the internal SSD memory. However, these aren't particularly big - though memory can be expanded through microSD cards. So, with Valve now planning on reducing the size of its shader caches, this update will free up more space for games on the console.

Players start out with 3 slots by default, and there's no other way to obtain more other than buying the new Bomb Squad bundle, which costs about £8.40. The cosmetic bundle contains other perks which players have pointed out will give those who pay for it an advantage over those who don't.

While the special edition Switch Pro was only officially confirmed by Nintendo during its Direct broadcast last month, fans had long expected a Zelda-themed model to arrive alongside the upcoming game. Indeed, earlier leaks online had even suggested at its design. 


So when Massachusetts GameStop employee Mike (last name kept anonymous) saw a "HW TBD Switch" entry pop up on his store's system hours before the Direct's broadcast, it didn't seem too surprising. Mike snapped a picture of the screen and uploaded it to reddit.

In response to these comments, Smith stated Microsoft's threat analysis team had "been identifying efforts by the Russians" to weave their way into gaming communities, with the intention to spread information from there. Smith specifically mentioned Discord and Minecraft, as an example. He said Microsoft has been "advising governments" on this issue, before stating: "It's the Wagner Group, it's Russian intelligence."

Email receipts are sent whenever games are downloaded from the PSN store, but this includes 'free' games downloaded as part of the PS Plus subscription.


This is something Sony has been doing since the PlayStation 3 days and likely caused many players confusion when downloading multiple games at once and receiving individual email receipts for each - despite them being for £0.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you think of Peppa Pig, you probably don't think of a brand that pushes boundaries. After all, Peppa comes from your typical nuclear family, and her adventures within the show are generally confined to the day to day dealings of their lives together: Peppa and her family taking a trip to the recycling centre, for example, or visiting a theme park, or doing some DIY around the house. You get the idea.


That said, the team behind the newly-released Peppa Pig: World Adventures video game wanted players to fully immerse themselves into Peppa's world, no matter what their family dynamic, blueprint or fabric looks like. As such, developer Petoons Studio and publisher Outright Games included a character creator so players can customise their animalistic avatar, from gender and species to fur colour and accessories. Then, once their own character is designed, players can do the same for the rest of their family. 


This means if players want to make their character a brown fox with a blue rabbit for a parent, they can. If they want their character to have siblings that are different animals to them, they can. If they want their parents to be the same gender, they can.

This year's Summer Games Done Quick - which will once again feature an in-person component - runs from Sunday, 28th May to Sunday, 4th June, and is set to feature more than 130 speedruns over its seven-day run-time, with all money raised going to Doctors Without Borders.


As ever, the newly shared schedule is an eclectic one, with the likes of Elden Ring and Hi-Fi Rush rubbing shoulders with everything from Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue and Peggle Deluxe to Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's latest monthly Xbox update is readying to roll out to consoles, this one introducing a refreshed Xbox search "experience" alongside a new adjustable active hours power setting, letting users decide when their machine can fully shut down.


Once the new update is installed, Xbox users can head to their console's Settings > General > Power options in order to determine what Microsoft calls their "active hours" - essentially, the times they're most likely to be using their machines.


During active hours (which are "always active" by default, until changed), Xbox can be instructed to power down using the Sleep option, enabling it to quickly reboot when required. Conversely, the console will power down using the more energy efficient Shutdown option outside of active hours, reducing power consumption from 10-15 watts when active to 0.5 watts, based on Microsoft's figures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amnesia: The Bunker, SOMA developer Frictional Games "unscripted" WW1 horror, has been delayed again, albeit only by a week. It's now due to release for PC on 23rd May, giving the studio a little extra time to "make sure everything is perfect before launch".


The Bunker, as you might already know, is the fourth game in Frictional's Amnesia series, following on from 2010's acclaimed The Dark Descent, its Chinese-Room-developed successor A Machine for Pigs, and 2021's Rebirth. It's also a bit of a departure for the series, trading traditionally linear tales of horror for "unscripted" scares in a nightmarish semi-open-world.


This time around, players take on the role of Henri Clément, a French soldier who, over the course of the game, is relentlessly pursued by an "adaptive" otherworldly creature through the claustrophobic confines of a dimly lit underground bunker.

Endless Dungeon, which was originally due to launch on 18th May, maroons players on a mysterious space station and tasks them with recruiting a team of heroes in an effort to transport a crystal to their crashed ship's core, protecting it - via some frenetic top-down twin-stick shooting action - from ceaseless waves of monsters along the way.


It features a new storyline set in the Endless universe, and can be played either solo - one player controlling the entire squad - or alongside friends in multiplayer, with available heroes including Comrade (Gunsmith), Bunker (Tank), Blaze (Artificer), and Shroom (Medic).

FuturLab has divided its new roadmap up into convenient quarters, each offering a mix of both free and paid DLC. The free stuff will reveal more of Muckingham, the not-entirely sensible setting of PowerWash Simulator's base game, while the paid Special Packs will take players outside of the Muckingham universe - presumably in a similar fashion to those aforementioned Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy 7 crossovers.


No more details have been shared on the paid stuff as yet, but FutureLab has confirmed PowerWash Simulator's first free update - The Muckingham Files (AKA Update 1.2) – will arrive next Tuesday, 18th April, transporting players to never-before-seen corners of Muckingham.

It's curious timing for the Microsoft-owned Bethesda to suddenly flood the service with its back catalogue in this way. 


Could it be another push by Microsoft to show regulators it doesn't limit access to titles from companies it previously bought, as the decision on whether Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition will succeed nears?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you so hungry for more The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom news you simply must consume it the second it appears (understandable), Nintendo has announced it'll be airing the final pre-launch trailer for its hugely anticipated Breath of the Wild follow-up tomorrow, Thursday 13th April.


If you need a little more in the way of specifics for your diary, Nintendo says the new trailer will be livestreamed at 3pm in the UK/7am PT, and will run to around three minutes in length. There's no word on what it'll feature as yet, but if Tingle's not included, I'll bloody riot.


Our last look at Tears of the Kingdom came toward the end of March, when Nintendo shared 10 minutes of new gameplay footage, showcasing some of Link's new abilities, new enemies, and the sky islands. It was enough to set Eurogamer's Christian Donlan a-quiver, and he subsequently named it Game of the Week.

For a quick bit of background before we get into it, Dark and Darker is facing a lot of issues at the moment, with developer Ironmace currently under investigation after gaming company Nexon claimed its game (P3) was used as a prototype for Dark and Darker. 


This all led to Dark and Darker being removed from Steam, where it was once the most wishlisted game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a bit of a leak earlier this year, developer FrozenByte has made it official; acclaimed physics-based co-op platformer Trine is returning for a fifth instalment - subtitled A Clockwork Conspiracy - sometime this "summer" on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.


First things first, Trine 5 once again adopts the series' classic 2.5D side-scrolling perspective after Trine 3's ambitious, but ultimately poorly received, foray into full 3D back in 2015. That's likely a reassurance for series fans, but also makes for a new instalment that perhaps doesn't particularly distinguish itself from its predecessors at first glance.


Not that more of the same is necessarily a bad thing; Trine has carved something of a niche for itself over the years, and its platform puzzling - built around using the unique abilities of the series' wizard, knight, and thief protagonists, from heavy lifting to block conjuring and hook grappling - remains as enjoyable today as it did when the series debuted almost 15 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rare co-founder Tim Stamper has been digging into his archive again of late, promising to reveal "more secrets" from the studio's vault, and his latest helping of retro treasure comes in the form of new footage from Rare's cancelled N64 game, Dream.


Announced back in 1995, Dream was to be Rare's take on the role-playing genre, with a dash of LucasArts thrown in, following the fairy-tale-inspired adventures of a boy named Edson as he battled the nefarious Captain Blackeye and his band of pirates. 


Originally planned for release on the SNES, Dream was later retooled for the N64, switching from isometric visuals to more ambitious full 3D. As time went on, however, technical issues and several rethinks caused some dramatic changes in direction, with Edson eventually being dropped in favour of new protagonist Banjo and the original RPG elements making way for a more straightforward Donkey Kong Country-esque platformer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If your animal splicing experiments are starting to feel a bit stale, there's some good news; park management sim Let's Build a Zoo is getting some aquarium-themed DLC later this year, opening up the potential for even more adorable/terrifying creature hybrids in your life.


Let's Build a Zoo, if you've not yet had the pleasure, melds familiar zoo tycoon gameplay - in which the aim is to build and manage an appealing (and hopefully lucrative) park, importing and breeding animals, managing staff, and so on - with a couple of unique twists.


There's a morality system - giving players the choice between maintaining a happy, ethical zoo or turning it into something considerably more dubious - as well as a compelling DNA splicing hook, enabling fearless tinkerers to combine any animals they've acquired into more exotic specimens, like crocoducks, giraffephants, and chickow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[QuakeCon returns this August with its first in-person event in three years.


QuakeCon 2023 runs from Thursday, 10th August until Sunday, 14th August and will be held at Texas' Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center. This marks the first time QuakeCon has featured an in-person event since 2019, with the show having switched to a digital-only schedule in 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic.


There are, however, some notable changes for this year's in-person return; Bethesda has announced it's ditching QuakeCon's usual General Admission entry and exhibit hall set-up in favour of a ticket-only event - requiring pre-registration - that'll emphasise the show's bring-your-own-computer LAN party experience.

There are several moments where the Super Mario Bros. Movie seems to set up characters and plot elements for future film entries - while the lack of story in this initial movie has come under criticism. 


Join us as we take a look beyond this rather safe - albeit still enjoyable - new step by Nintendo into the world of cinema, and consider where the Super Mario Bros. Movie series will most likely head next... as well as where we hope it doesn't.

Like its 2017 predecessor, Super Bomberman R 2 serves up a sizeable mix of single-player and multiplayer modes inspired by Konami's classic bomb-dropping arcade series.


This time around, lone players can test their mettle in the appropriately titled Solo-Bomb mode, which takes them on a story driven jaunt through space as they explore planets, using their bombs to destroy objects and annihilate enemies.

It&#8217;s an interesting experiment, and the results are likely to vary wildly based on the details of the experiment.</p>
<p>But while it&#8217;s an easy experiment to run, it misses the real risk of large language models (LLMs) writing scam emails. Today&#8217;s human-run scams aren&#8217;t limited by the number of people who respond to the initial email contact. They&#8217;re limited by the labor-intensive process of persuading those people to send the scammer money. LLMs are about to change that. A decade ago, one type of spam email had become a punchline on every late-night show: &#8220;I am the son of the late king of Nigeria in need of your assistance&#8230;.&#8221; Nearly everyone had gotten one or a thousand of those emails, to the point that it seemed everyone must have known they were scams...</p>]]></summary>

Behaviour figured that the change – which saw the time to heal slowed from 16 to 24 seconds – would be contentious, and said that it would keep "an extra close eye on this change to see how it would play out". 

"After reviewing player feedback, we found that many of you agreed that the speed which you heal others was already in a good spot prior to the update," the team explained in an update. "This change also had knock-on effects elsewhere in the game, making effects like Mangled and Hemorrhage stronger and making ‘slugging’ (leaving Survivors in the dying state) even more effective.

"We’ve taken a broad look at community feedback across the game since launch and have been working to address several areas in the coming weeks, while also forging ahead on content for our upcoming seasons," said game director, Joe Blackburn. "Let’s get into the things we’re building and improving in response to your input on Lightfall so far."

In a public statement, Isaaman reflected on employment stats and revealed that whilst "both male and female gamers experienced similarly high levels of toxicity, showing that toxicity is an issue across the entire gaming community", "the experience that girls and women encounter are often much darker and threatening".

"Sexist stereotypes and being aggressively quizzed about their gaming skills often lead to more violent verbal abuse and threats of rape," Isaaman says. "Even more disturbingly, the abuse doesn’t always stop once players leave the game – some instances manifest into serious consequences outside of gaming, including stalking on other platforms and threats of this transferring into real life.

The biggies, of course, are largely being fronted by Geoff Keighley, and following confirmation Summer Games Fest returns on 8th June, Keighley has dated his next big event: Gamescom Opening Night Live, which airs on 22nd August.


Keighley confirmed the return of Opening Night Live on Twitter, but stopped short of sharing much in the way of specifics. We do know, though, that it'll once again be held at Cologne's Koelnmesse, kickstarting a week of Gamescom, which this year runs from 23rd-27th August.


"Excited to be back in Cologne with the fans and industry," Keighley wrote in his announcement tweet, "streaming video game news directly to you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has issued a fresh response to the ongoing drama surrounding Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, and criticised the UK regulator currently probing the deal for recently softening its stance.  Sony's statement also highlights the recent comments made by Redfall creative director Harvey Smith as fresh evidence of how Microsoft might mistreat Call of Duty on PlayStation if it were to own the first-person shooter series itself.


Last month, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority softened its stance on a key area of its concern over the deal passing, as it concluded that Microsoft owning Call of Duty would not "result in a substantial lessening of competition" in the console market. Sony's response to this decision, published publicly today, is unsurprisingly critical of this latest development, which it slams "surprising, unprecedented, and irrational". 


The response also leaps upon last month's drama which erupted from comments made by creative director Harvey Smith, who revealed that Microsoft had canned plans for a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after buying Bethesda. These comments, Sony has now said, were an indication of how Microsoft could also treat Call of Duty, if and when the deal goes through.

The feature, which could emulate the sense of either hot or cold to the user, is part of several discussed in a patent for a controller made - at least in part - of a more gel-like material than the current plastic. 


Sony's describes an "elastically deformable material" which is able to better aid in haptic feedback, and which can detect when said "elastic member" is touched, pressed, twisted, pinched, squashed, rubbed, or even "in the action of bringing a hand close to the elastic member".

<blockquote><p>As progress in AI continues to advance, it is important to know how advanced systems will make choices and in what ways they may fail. Machines can already outsmart humans in some domains, and understanding how to safely build ones which may have capabilities at or above the human level is of particular concern. One might suspect that artificially generally intelligent (AGI) and artificially superintelligent (ASI) will be systems that humans cannot reliably outsmart. As a challenge to this assumption, this paper presents the Achilles Heel hypothesis which states that even a potentially superintelligent system may nonetheless have stable decision-theoretic delusions which cause them to make irrational decisions in adversarial settings. In a survey of key dilemmas and paradoxes from the decision theory literature, a number of these potential Achilles Heels are discussed in context of this hypothesis. Several novel contributions are made toward understanding the ways in which these weaknesses might be implanted into a system...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The problem
Since v1.19 (released in 2020), the Kubernetes project provides 12-14 months of patch releases for each minor version.
This enables users to qualify and adopt Kubernetes versions in an annual upgrade cycle and receive security fixes for a year.
The Go project releases new minor versions twice a year,
and provides security fixes for the last two minor versions, resulting in about a year of support for each Go version.
Even though each new Kubernetes minor version is built with a supported Go version when it is first released,
that Go version falls out of support before the Kubernetes minor version does,
and the lengthened Kubernetes patch support since v1.19 only widened that gap.
At the time this was written, just over half of all Go patch releas…]]></summary>

Sony Santa Monica announced a New Game Plus mode was on the way last December, but specifics were pretty scarce at the time. Now, though, in a post on the PlayStation Blog, the studio has detailed exactly what players can expect from their second go around.


As you'd expect, New Game Plus becomes available after clearing Ragnarök for the first time, giving players the option to carry their existing skills, equipment, and weapons (including the Draupnir Spear) over from their previous saves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veteran Mario voice actor Charles Martinet was previously confirmed to voicing a couple of characters in the Super Mario Bros. Movie - and now the film has been released, fans think they've worked out who those characters are.


Having watched the film myself, it's fair to say Martinet's voice is indeed recognisable - though the movie's credits don't offer any concrete confirmation. Instead, Martinet's name is grouped alongside other secondary voice actors, without going into specifics on the exact characters he plays. 


If you'd prefer not to know more ahead of watching the film, take this as your spoiler warning - and feel free to head over and read our spoiler-free Super Mario Bros. Movie review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phil Harrison has departed Google, where he served as vice president and general manager of Stadia, following the beleaguered cloud gaming service's demise earlier this year.


Harrison joined Google in 2018 and shepherded Stadia through its high-profile - if increasingly problematic - launch in 2019, remaining onboard during the service's slow, steady decline. It was Harrison who announced the closure of Stadia's internal game development studios in 2021, and, ultimately, shared word of the cloud gaming service's impending demise last September, admitting it hadn't "gained the traction with users that we expected".


Ahead of Stadia's closure this January, Harrison said the underlying streaming tech would live on at Google, and would be made available "industry partners" - but Google later clarified its white label streaming offering had also been axed alongside the consumer-facing side.

Over 400 Twitch employees lost their jobs in late March, with Twitch CEO Dan Clancy blaming the "current macroeconomic environment" for the layoffs. 


The further 100 employees who are being laid off are a part of Game Growth, Amazon Game's San Diego studio, and Prime Gaming, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC. The memo was written by vice president of Amazon Games Christoph Hartmann.

Having seen the movie for ourselves, Eurogamer can now go into detail on what these scenes are - so, take this as your spoiler warning if you are going to see the film and don't want to know what to expect. 


There are actually two scenes to stay put for throughout the movie's credits - one after the first set of credits (which end with a pleasing nod to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata) and then the other at the very end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a bit of a VR-focused update back in February, Hello Games has once again turned its content nozzle on No Man's Sky, blasting out pilotable Sentinel ships, corrupted worlds, and more in the exploratory space sim's new Interceptor update.


Interceptor picks up where February's Fractal update left off, making the new Interceptor ship class (previously an expedition-exclusive reward) available to everyone. However, given these vessels' unique Sentinel-tech, players will need some special resources to make them tick.


As it happens, Sentinels factor heavily in No Man's Sky latest update, with players also able to acquire Sentinel Multi-Tools and Sentinel jetpacks. Additionally, it's now possible for well-armed Travellers to take on powerful Sentinel Capital ships, with victory against the new threats clearing a player's "wanted" status and earning new high-value rewards.

Creative 2.0, which launched last month, allows players to add custom assets and programming to their creations on PC. Shortly after it became available, Epic updated their terms and conditions to allow players to create and publish remakes of old Fortnite maps from Chapter 1.
Epic also reiterated that players are not allowed to use Creative 2.0 to "create, publish, or monetise content based on others' copyrighted IP", though that did not stop players.

The DK Rap, created by Kirkhope for 1999's Donkey Kong 64, is quite the legendary number, if you've never heard it before.


And last week, Seth Rogen, who voices leader of the bunch Donkey Kong in the Mario movie, revealed the DK Rap would feature in the film. Kirkhope initially responded with excitement, which has now turned into frustration.

Mario has had a few mobile outings over the last seven years - starting with Super Mario Run in 2016, and then Mario Kart Tour and Dr. Mario World in 2019.


Nintendo has since moved away from Mario on mobile, after it shut down Dr. Mario World for good just two years after it launched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive's acclaimed grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is ready to hit the road, with its Tours and Tournaments expansion now confirmed to be launching on 11th May.


Tours and Tournaments - Crusader Kings 3's second major expansion, following last year's Royal Court - has something of an outdoor theme. Those "tours", for instance, arrive as part of a new travel system, giving players the tools to plot either a modest trip - perhaps navigating their realm, gifting or extorting their vassals along the way - or a far more elaborate globe-trotting jaunt, whether that be through dangerous or civilised lands, alone or with an entourage.


Tournaments, meanwhile, can be hosted around the map, their demonstrations of combat drawing nearby nobles and wandering knights, and potentially boosting players' social standing or military prowess. Additionally, players' best knights can be honoured with special titles and accolades granting bonuses to both them and the armies they lead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of the Sea VR, the virtual reality adaptation of developer Out of the Blue's acclaimed 2020 tropical island mystery adventure, launches for Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro on 13th April.


Call of the Sea, if you're unfamiliar, tells the story of Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One's Cissy Jones), as she embarks on an adventure, circa 1934, across a beautiful but strange South Pacific island in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a bit of a delight - Eurogamer's Robert Purchese called the original a "dazzlingly different debut" in his review - melding story, exploration, and some surprisingly challenging puzzles into a thrilling, affecting yarn with a touch of cosmic weirdness about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's perpetually expanding line-up of wireless Xbox controllers continues to flourish with a new 'sustainable' variant released to coincide with this year's impending Earth Day.


The new Xbox Wireless Controller – Remix Special Edition, as it's known, takes some design inspiration from nature, sporting a two-tone green facade - apparently drawing on lichen found in the Pacific Northwest Forest - as well as earthy grips finished with a topographic pattern. It also incorporates a blue underside, presumably representing the sky, or the sea, or a blueberry.


As for the sustainability bit, one third of the controller is made from a mix of reclaimed materials (including plastic jugs and CDs) and regrind - regrind, in this instance, being a process that mechanically recycles leftover Xbox One controller parts into a raw material that can be used to partially create new controllers, Microsoft explains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/3cx-supply-chain-attack-north-korea-cryptocurrency-targets/">News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers at Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky today revealed that they identified a small number of cryptocurrency-focused firms as at least some of the victims of the 3CX software supply-chain attack that&#8217;s unfolded over the past week. Kaspersky declined to name any of those victim companies, but it notes that they&#8217;re based in &#8220;western Asia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security firms CrowdStrike and SentinelOne last week pinned the operation on North Korean hackers, who compromised 3CX installer software that&#8217;s used by 600,000 organizations worldwide, according to the vendor. Despite the potentially massive breadth of that attack, which SentinelOne dubbed “Smooth Operator,” Kaspersky has now found that the hackers combed through the victims infected with its corrupted software to ultimately target fewer than 10 machines­&#8212;at least as far as Kaspersky could observe so far&#8212;­and that they seemed to be focusing on cryptocurrency firms with “surgical precision.”...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

One weekend later, and either Asus is showing way too much commitment to the bit, or its handheld PC is real.

Titled the ROG Ally, much hasn't been officially announced in terms of specs or price, but here's what we've seen of it so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard has settled a lawsuit lodged by the US Justice Department regarding a controversial tax planned for the wages of esports players. 


Overwatch and Call of Duty esports teams were set to be given an effective salary cap, dubbed the Competitive Balance Tax, which was designed to kick in after teams earned over a certain threshold. 


This tax "effectively operated as a salary cap, penalised teams for paying esports players above a certain threshold and limited player compensation in these leagues", the US Justice Department alleged.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2's newest Support hero has leaked ahead of their official reveal by Blizzard. Here's an introduction to Lifeweaver, a plant-based pansexual and the game's first Thai hero.


In a now-deleted article over on PCGamesN, Overwatch 2's senior character technical artist Chonlawat Thammawan revealed a number of inspirations for Lifeweaver (also known as Niran Pruksamanee), such as the mandala shape. Thammawan, who originally pitched the idea of including a Thai character, said Lifeweaver is a celebration of Thai culture, while lead narrative designer Gavin Jurgens-Fyhrie spoke more of the hero's warm character.


As for Lifeweaver's skill set, it all sounds pretty nifty. He uses a technology of his own invention called "biolight" to help heal those that are sick and wounded. Along with these healing abilities, Lifeweaver can also manipulate the positions of Overwatch 2's enemies and even his allies should the need occur. This is all thanks to his Life Grip skill.

If you're wondering how and why Moushley has turned up on your Twitter feed, even without all the random changes Elon Musk implements daily, here's what happened.
When character redesigns for the remake were first revealed, a few people (myself included) mourned the loss of Ashley's ears poking out from under her hair. I think it's cute! I've always jokingly considered them Dumbo ears, though others see the similarities to a mouse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guerrilla has released a new patch for its PSVR2 title, Horizon Call of the Mountain.


As with most updates, this patch (known as Patch 1.04) addresses a collection of bits and bobs across the game - for example, this patch fixes an issue that saw the Aim Assistance re-enabled when some players rebooted the title. Meanwhile, a user's UI should no longer disappear after fighting the Scrappers.


In addition to this, Guerrilla has also fixed the glitch that could cause a Watcher to become inactive and not attack the player, so stay on your guard.

If you're late to the party, yes, there's a movie about Tetris - though it's less about the blocks themselves and more the game developer who dreamt them up. 


It's available on Apple TV+ now, if you have that. If not, just go play some more Tetris Effect Connected - now with two additional levels!

"Unreal Engine 5 is incredibly new technology to us (and all developers), and we aim to use this cutting-edge tech to its fullest potential while creating a game with never-before-achieved scope at Studio Wildcard," it wrote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog has released a second update to address some of the many complaints leveraged at its recently launch and poorly recieved The Last of Us Part 1 PC port, this one primarily targetting memory and performance concerns.


The Last of Us Part 1 finally launched for PC earlier this week after a 25-day delay designed to ensure it would debut "in the best shape possible." Unfortunately, and despite that delay, PC purchasers on Steam quickly began reporting a host of technical issues - including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - soon garnering the port a Mostly Negative rating on Valve's storefront.


Since then, Naughty Dog has acknowledged player's complaints, saying it's "heard your concerns, and our team is actively investigating multiple issues you've reported."

Arriving almost exactly four months after Vampire Survivors' first expansion Legacy of the Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari sees the minimalist survival RPG taking a trip to western Europe for an adventure inspired by fairy tales and folklore.


Deep in a great forest, where the barrier between worlds is perilously thin, lies the Foscari Academy, where generations of warriors, magic-wielders, and thieves can learn their craft.

E3 was a stage for video game companies to strut their stuff, a certain tier of celebrities to make their presences felt, and console rivals to take not-so-subtle pops at one another. 


It was a place of huge excitement and anticipation, where internet memes and catchphrases were born, and extremely vanilla marketing executives became legends. It was also a place of failure and disappointment, as outlandish concepts and eyebrow-raising price points were debuted.

However, Kirkhope is also widely known for his DK rap number, something he composed for Donkey Kong 64 all the way back in the '90s.


This little number will be introduced to a new generation of Mario-loving fans thanks to its inclusion in the Super Mario Bros. Movie (of course, there is also the chance parents have already shown the rap to their children - I certainly have). 


Seth Rogen, who voices Donkey Kong in the upcoming film, has revealed this iconic tune will be in the Super Mario Bros. Movie. In fact, it is the song Donkey Kong "comes out to", according to Rogen.

At last night's BAFTA Game Awards, a number of actors spoke to Eurogamer about their scepticism of whether AI can truly replicate human performances and what its impact could be on the voice acting industry.

That's according to a report by Bloomberg (paywall), and as evidenced by code sourced by TheTapeDrive editor and iOS developer Steve Moser over on Twitter.


This code, which was found within the Netflix app, states: "A game on your TV needs a controller to play. Do you want to use this phone as a game controller?" This suggests the media company is at least experimenting with the use of smartphones as controllers for its games on TV, even if it has not made any public statements as yet.

Project Sirius was first outlined last October as part of CD Projekt's ambitious studio roadmap, which included a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, a new IP, the next Witcher trilogy, a remake of the first Witcher game, and Project Sirius, a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience being developed by The Flame and the Flood studio Molasses Flood.


Last week, however, CD Projekt announced its intention to write-off funds allotted to Project Sirius, saying it had re-evaluated the "scope and commercial potential of the original concept" and was now "formulating a new framework" better "aligned with the [company's] strategy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadows of Doubt, the wildly ambitious and long-in-development procedural detective noir from developer Cole Jefferies, is launching into Steam early access on 24th April.


Shadows of Doubt, which Jefferies first started discussing all the way back in April 2018, is a first-person, open-world detective sim - complete with the prerequisite snooping and stealth - set in a procedurally-generated noirish sci-fi city.


That procedural generation, which also incorporates elements of hand-crafted design, governs everything from the city's streets and fully explorable buildings to the citizens milling around the world as determined by their personal schedules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mask of the Rose, the "marvellous romance with a hint of murder" visual novel from Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies developer Failbetter Games, has been delayed a little longer and is now eyeing up an 8th June release on PC and Switch.


Mask of the Rose, if you're unfamiliar, takes place in 1862, shortly after the city of Fallen London (an alternate-universe version of Victorian London) is stolen by bats and carried to a vast underground cavern system deep beneath the Earth's surface.


Here, in Mask of the Rose, players will need to pop on their investigatory hats as they attempt to solve the mystery of Fallen London's first post-plunge murder and clear their housemate Archie's name - a task that'll see them exploring "cosy, mysterious and magnificent" locations, donning outfits, doing odd jobs to earn money and resources, and replaying the mystery to uncover "deeper and deeper" secrets.

Savant - Ascent, which D-Pad calls a "shoot-em-up platformer", casts players as the Alchemist, a magical practitioner forced from their tower by a mysterious entity. The goal, then, is to return to the top by clearing stages consisting solely of two platforms - which players will need to carefully navigate as they fend off swarms of enemies using their projectiles.


Savant - Ascent is inspired by the music of Norweigian artist Savant, and its newly announced Anniversary Edition promises new stages, abilities, bosses, and power-ups, plus a new Survival Mode pitting players against a parade of bosses as they ride the Endless Elevator.

But in recreating and reinventing its masterpiece, Capcom went even further back it seems, as players have spotted a reference to the fabled Resident Evil 3.5, an earlier version of RE4 which was in development but ultimately canned.

Sales analysis published by Bloomberg has pegged the VR2's sales total at around 270k units, as of the end of March. 


The publication previously reported that Sony had slashed the shipment forecast for its new VR headset, and expected to sell around 1m units at launch following underwhelming pre-order numbers.

Admission control is an important part of the Kubernetes control plane, with several internal
features depending on the ability to approve or change an API object as it is submitted to the
server. It is also useful for an administrator to be able to define business logic, or policies,
regarding what objects can be admitted into a cluster. To better support that use case, Kubernetes
introduced external admission control in
v1.7.
In addition to countless custom, internal implementations, many open source projects and commercial
solutions implement admission controllers with user-specified policy, including

In a letter to staff, later shared publicly on EA's website, CEO Andrew Wilson announced the job cuts while simultaneously insisting the company was "operating from a position of strength". 


"As we drive greater focus across our portfolio, we are moving away from projects that do not contribute to our strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint, and restructuring some of our teams," Wilson told workers at the company. "These decisions are expected to impact approximately six percent of our company's workforce."

The newly announced DLC - created in collaboration with developer Everbloom Games - takes players across five familiar Forgotten Realms locations, including Candlekeep and Icewind Dale, all reimagined in chunky block-o-vision, just as you'd expect in a Minecraft crossover.


The DLC, however, goes the extra mile and then some by introducing a fully voiced 10-hour story campaign enabling adventurers and their friends - playing as either barbarians, paladins, wizards, or rogues, complete with associated abilities - to take on familiar D&D enemies including beholders, mimics, mindflayers, and, yes, dragons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wildfrost, the card-battling roguelike from Caveblazers studio Deadpan Games and artist Gaziter, now has a released date, and will be hitting the deck on Switch and PC on 12th April.


Wildfrost sends brave adventurers on a perilous journey through monster-infested tundra and icy mountains as they battle to reach the mysterious Sun Temple and save the town of Snowdwell from an everlasting winter - a quest that'll require "determination, sharp strategy and deck-building skills", according to its developer.


Stats and skills are randomised at the start of a run once players have selected their preferred Leader, and, along the way, there'll be companions to rescue and recruit, elemental treasures to unearth, merchants only too willing to flog their wares to weary adventurers, plus "wondrous wobbly charms" - with each decision contributing to a battle deck that's unique to a run.

In Tanta We Trust's action takes place 25 years before the events of the main game, after protagonist Frey is catapulted back in time to the Purge of the Rheddig - the battle that devastated the land of Athia and drove the Tantas, its corrupted matriachs, to madness. 


The DLC's ensuing quest to save Athia promises a new set of magical abilities for Frey, new companion Tanta Cinta, and "unique, vertically-designed" environments to explore.

Specifically, Kotick believed NetEase boss Ding Lei had suggested his company could sway the Chinese government's decision over whether to pass Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in the country. 


But this threat was simply a misunderstanding by Kotick, according to a number of New York Times sources familiar with a crucial Zoom call between the two company leaders via the use of translators.

In a press release on its website, the JFTC "reviewed the transaction and reached the conclusion that the transaction is unlikely to result in substantially restraining competition in any particular fields of trade. Accordingly, the JFTC has notified the Parties that the JFTC will not issue a cease and desist order, resulting in the completion of its review."



Japan joins the likes of Brazil and Saudi Arabia to approve the merger, while the deal remains under review across the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has sent an email to staff stating Sony's behaviour is "disappointing" but won't affect the long term relationship between the two companies.


In a bid to prevent Microsoft's proposed $69bn takeover of Activision Blizzard, Sony has claimed the deal would be anti-competitive and even stated Microsoft could release a deliberately buggy version of Call of Duty on PlayStation.


Kotick directly addresses these statements in his email.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has shown off Jun Kazama gameplay from Tekken 8.


This is a big moment for Tekken fans: Jun made her debut in 1995's Tekken 2 and hasn't been a playable character in the mainline Tekken series since. 28 years later, she's back and it looks like she hasn't aged a day. Tekken time logic!


The footage kicks off with Jun fighting her own son, Jin, but the highlight is Jun's long-awaited encounter with Jin's dad, Kazuya Mishima. It's all a bit Jerry Springer.

The Last of Us Part 1 - Naughty Dog's new-gen spruce-up of the acclaimed 2013 stealth survival horror - initially launched for PlayStation 5 last September, and its long-promised PC port finally arrived earlier today following a 25-day delay designed to ensure, as Naughty Dog put it last month, its "PC debut is in the best shape possible."


Unfortunately, early word from PC players on Steam is that The Last of Us Part 1's "best shape" is nowhere near good enough, with Steam reviews (reflected in similar reports on The Last of Us subreddit) pointing to a host of technical issues, including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - even on high-end hardware.

Volition's newly released roadmap marks the first time the studio has discussed additional content for the reboot since last October when, following a particularly bug-riddled launch, it announced it would initially be prioritising "improvements over new features".


Now though, having released a number of significant patches to address Saints Row's most pressing issues in the months since its launch last August, Volition is ready to talk new stuff, starting with a free Dead Island 2 cosmetics pack this April.

The publisher initially announced its intention to attend E3's 2023 live show - which is being organised by Eurogamer parent company Reedpop for the first time this year - back in February, insisting it would bring a "strong line-up" of titles to the Los Angeles event.


At the time, Ubisoft was the only major publisher to have publicly committed to E3 2023 - which resurrects the in-person component last since in 2019, prior to COVID - amid reports Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo would all be skipping the expo.

Here, he then glides on to one of Tears of the Kingdom's sky islands, where he comes across new enemies known as "constructs". 


This trailer also gives us a look at the new weapon fusing mechanic. Link can add keese eyeballs to arrows to make homing arrows, and mushrooms to shields (yes, mushrooms to shields). When the shroom shield is struck by an advancing enemy, the mushroom creates a cloud of spores that engulfs the fight in a fog. This fusing technique can also be used to make vehicles like rafts from stray logs and fans, or even flying ships, thanks to the Ultrahand ability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers have spoken about the "morally and physically exhausting" crunch culture at Ubisoft Paris. 


In a report by NME focused primarily on the development of Just Dance 2023, members of the Solidaires Informatique union group for Ubisoft Paris said pre-production for the game was a "mess". 


Reportedly, the Just Dance 2023 team was "tasked with changing the Just Dance 2023 engine just 11 months before launch", while bosses continued to push ideas "that had to be considered at all costs". This was despite developers saying they were "already underwater" at this point.

Kerbal Space Program 2, which released in early access in February, received its first (extensive) patch earlier this month. This followed a rather rocky launch for the space-flight simulator, which saw a steep fall in player numbers soon after release, with many asking for refunds due to the game's buggy state.


Now, the KSP2 team is working on another patch, with creative director Nate Simpson noting that while it'll be "tough to beat the sheer number of fixes that went into Patch One", players can still expect "a few big ones" to arrive in Patch Two.

This follows an accusation from Nexon, another Korean developer and one which several Ironmace employees used to work for, which claimed its game (P3) was used as a prototype for Dark and Darker.


Over the weekend, Ironmace stated it had been served a cease and desist letter and DMCA takedown by Nexon, something the developer said is "based on distorted claims". As a result, Dark and Darker was removed from Steam.


At this time, Ironamce asked for "understanding" as it worked to get the game back on the site, noting that "due to the sensitive legal nature of this issue" it has to be "careful with [its] statements so as to not jeopardise [its] position".

Whilst not formally confirmed, the game – called Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania Edition, unsurprisingly enough – popped up on the US Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), clearly marked as coming to PS5 (thanks, Gematsu).

Right now, we're unclear if it's a digital release or if we'll get a physical version, too, but it'll be good news nonetheless for PlayStation 5 owners who want to experience a native Dead Cells adventure, rather than via the backwards-compatible PS4 version which released five years ago.

The game – which boasts the curious conceit that you can play alone and then later with a friend – launched in early access yesterday, and will be available as an open playtest between now and 4th April.

Like other games released in EA, the two-person development team says the plan is to "make sure that Duel Corp turns into a well-rounded product for full release" when "it's the complete experience we want it to be". Consequently, the team believes the game will be in early access "for about one year".

As is usually the case, fans have already forensically examined the teaser image, and reckon it includes the new Mazda 3, and possibly a Panamera Sport Turismo or an Audi RS5 DTM.

Dubbed "version 2", the reference secreted in the files states that whilst the severity of Left4Dead3 is "high" – whatever that means – the priority is "none", which comes as no surprise to many of the commenters on Steam's subreddit page.

Whispers of a new Left 4 Dead title have been heard from several sources for several years now. Back in December 2019, Valve News Network's well-connected Tyler McVicker told Twitter followers that "Left 4 Dead VR is real", while in January 2020, Chinese HTC president Alvin Wang Graylin shared slides from a VR presentation making mention of Left 4 Dead 3.

With much of the final, climactic level in place and the last few visual effects coming in, the developers at Sony Santa Monica realised they had a bit of a problem: there's a big plot development that happens here, essential to the entire story of God of War Ragnarok - but nobody who played the game would notice it.


The moment in question here is Atreus' big realisation, that bringing about Ragnarok is, after all, maybe not the best idea - something he notices when dwarven companion Sindri sets off a kind of magical shockwave, which destroys the Asgardian villains' defences but, also, takes out a good few innocent civilians, too.

Whilst it still has some ways to go to take the top spot – pole position holder PUBG Battlegrounds' concurrent record is twice as high at CS:GO's at 3.2 million – it's an incredible feat for a decade-old shooter.

Paramount Global senior VP Doug Rosen confirmed to Polygon that the third-person action-RPG adaptation will be "a darker, more mature take" on the TMNT IP, reportedly likening the game to Sony Santa Monica's God of War games. 

According to Rosen, the game will follow a single Turtle – in the comic, it's Michaelangelo – although it may be possible to play as others, including perhaps other notable characters like April and Splinter, in flashbacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark and Darker has been removed from Steam after developer Ironmace received a cease and desist demand from Korean publisher Nexon.

Fans first noticed changes being made to the RPG's Steam store page overnight, when assets like videos and screenshots were quietly removed. Then they realised that online co-op and PvP had stopped working, followed by the complete removal of all traces of the game. Now, if you attempt to load the game's Steam store, it'll take you to Steam's front page.

"To all our fans, we have recently been served a cease and desist letter and DMCA takedown by Nexon regarding Dark and Darker based on distorted claims," Ironmace explained via the community's Discord server (thanks, Reddit).

<blockquote><p>&#8220;When a squid ends up chipping what’s called its ring tooth, which is the nail underneath its tentacle, it needs to regrow that tooth very rapidly, otherwise it can’t claw its prey,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>This was intriguing news ­ and it sparked an idea in Hopkins lab where he’d been trying to figure out how to store and transmit heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It diffuses in all directions. There’s no way to capture the heat and move it the way that you would electricity. It’s just not a fundamental law of physics.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tiny brown batteries he mentions are about the size of a chiclet, and Hopkins says it will take a decade or more to create larger batteries that could have commercial value...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played Wordle religiously through 2022, you might remember one particularly rough day's answer: Parer.


This turned out to be the most difficult word of the year, in part thanks to its use of a recurring 'r', but a GDC talk yesterday from Zoe Bell, the New York Times' executive producer of games, revealed it broke a particularly whopping amount of streaks.


Typically, Bell explained, showing a chart that tracked players' streak breaks over time, "15 percent of people break their streak on a given day - except that one day, with 'parer', where almost 60 percent of people broke their streak."
