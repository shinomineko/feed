        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's upcoming pirate game Skull and Bones is "not a narrative-driven game".

That's according to game director Ryan Barnard, who revealed to True Achievements that whilst it will have "narrative pieces", focus on your player's own story and has "an underlying story", the adventure will not be "narrative-driven".

"Skull and Bones is not a narrative-driven game," Barnard explains. “We have narrative pieces - in the game, you'll meet important NPCs called Kingpins which have their own stories that you'll learn as you develop rapport with them by taking on contracts with them. There is an underlying story to the game with which we build the entire world lore, but that's not the main focus. We want players to create their own stories and be able to choose the type of pirate they want to be.

Teaming up with (wonderful) content creator Christopher Odd, Firaxis's five-minute video lets us see how the sorcerer can be best utilised when the card-based strategy game finally drops later this year.

As spotted by NME, Doctor Strange - a support hero - has some interesting tricks up his sleeve, including the ability to heal, protect, and completely conceal himself and allies in battle.

Whilst not formally confirmed by either developer Behaviour Interactive nor Resident Evil rights holder, Capcom, credible DBD leaker DBDLeaks has shared some very convincing assets, including images of the icons, outfits, charms, dialogue lines, and character biographies for Albert Wesker, Rebecca Chambers, and Ada Wong.

Wesker - called "The Mastermind" - will be a playable Killer, and you'll be able to jump into the shoes of Ada and Rebecca as Survivors. While their perks are apparently yet to be finalised, DBDLeaks has shared what they say are Wesker's perks: Superior Anatomy, Awakened Awareness, and Terminus, which collectively allow Wesker to vault faster, see the auras of other Survivors whilst carrying one, and cause Survivors to be "permanently Broken when the exit gates are open".

As spotted by the eagle-eyed members of the Disco Elysium subreddit, job listings for three new artistic positions at the studio are perhaps hinting what themes and motifs may be apparent in the studio's next game.

Interestingly, fans of the RPG don't necessarily think this marks a big departure for the team, though, especially given "how much time [the creators] have put into cultivating the setting of Disco Elysium".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Valve's pledge to more than double its Steam Deck shipments back in June, the company has announced that improvements to its supply chain mean it'll now be able to fulfil all current reservations for the handheld gaming PC "by the end of the year".


Steam Deck has, of course, been in massive demand since its unveiling last July, with wait times for reservations rapidly stretching into this year. Unfortunately, supply chain issues forced Valve to delay initial shipments from the end of 2021 into this year, with further rollouts perhaps not as rapid as Valve would have liked.


We've had plenty of updates since then - Valve said it would be ramping up production into "the hundreds of thousands" in March, while June saw it announce shipments would more than double in the coming months - and the latest brings great news for those that already have Steam Deck reservations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shortly after Nintendo released the first wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass DLC in March, data miners uncovered what appeared to be a near-complete list of platforms each new wave would be pulling tracks from - and the recent arrival of Wave 2 appears to validate that leak, giving fans a solid foundation for the giddy speculation of classic tracks still to come.


Following Wave 1's release, data miner Fishguy6564 shared a video of Mario Kart 8's track selection screen with the Booster Course Pass' ten remaining cups unlocked, complete with the platform origin of each included track. The then-unreleased Wave 2's Turnip Cup, for instance, was shown to contain four tracks taken from Mario Kart Tour, SNES, N64, and DS, while Propeller Cup listed tracks from Tour, GBA, Wii, and a final, yet to be defined course.


We now know, following Wave 2's release this week, that those leaked platforms line up perfectly with Mario Kart 8's newly expanded track roster. The final track listing for the Turnip Cup is New York Minute (Mario Kart Tour), Mario Cart Circuit 3 (SNES), Kalimari Desert (N64), and Waluigi Pinball (DS), while the Propeller Cup brings Sydney Sprint (Tour), Snow Land (GBA), Mushroom Gorge (Wii), and Sky-High Sundae (Tour). Notably, the latter is debuting as part of the Booster Pack but coming to Tour later, which might explain its absent tag in the leak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following an extensive report into the development of Rockstar's hugely anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 earlier this week, a few additional claims have surfaced, giving a clearer indication of just how ambitious the project was originally planned to be.


Rockstar finally confirmed development on GTA 6 was "well underway" earlier this year, and while official details remain extremely limited, a report by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier on Tuesday shared a number of tantalising details about the project, claiming it'll be set in Miami and will feature the series' first female protagonist as part of a Bonny and Clyde-style duo.


Notably, though, Schreier claimed Rockstar's initial plans were much more ambitious, featuring a map that would include "large swaths of North and South America". Axios' Stephen Totilo has since added a little more detail to those claims, citing his own source as saying Rockstar had earlier planned to have four protagonists in GTA 6, with the action unfolding across three cities.

Reality Labs, the division of Meta which works on its virtual reality and metaverse products, posted a net $2.8bn loss over the last three months. 


Revenue during this period saw a 48 percent increase to $452m, which CFO Dave Wehner attributed to sales of Meta Quest 2 during Meta's earnings call with investors, but this was heavily outweighed by the costs and investments Meta is putting into Reality Labs.

For example, someone has taken inspiration from the truly horrifying PT demo, and remade it using the tools from Forge mode.


Spotted by PC Gamer, cosplayer Death Templar shared their PT x Halo hybrid creation on YouTube. As with PT, the player starts in a barren and gloomy room, with only one exit. The difference here, however, is that they have a gun (and I didn't spot a cockroach on the floor).

This competition has helped the industry, Moore continued, and saw Microsoft continuing to commit to video games despite the Xbox 360's costly "Red Ring of Death" debacle.


"We encouraged the console wars, not to create division, but to challenge each other," Moore said, speaking on the Front Office Sports podcast (thanks, IGN). "And when I say each other I mean Microsoft and Sony.

However, if you are one of the many who got their hands on the game when it was included as part of PlayStation Plus, there's bad news. The new upgrade is only available to those who actually purchased the game, rather than getting it via Sony's subscription service.

A new report from The Wrap has revealed that following its buyout by Amazon, MGM has lost the rights to the Tomb Raider films. The studio reportedly had until May of this year to move ahead with a sequel, but that ship has now sailed.


As a result, a "host of Hollywood movie studios" are currently making bids on the rights to the film, with insiders revealing that this has resulted in Alicia Vikander being removed from the project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares, the developer behind last year's investigatory open-world adventure Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, has announced it's remaking Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, a Lovecraft-themed crossover the studio originally released back in 2007.


The Awakened was Frogwares' third Sherlock Holmes adventure, and the developer's ongoing association with the detective has resulted in an additional six instalments in the series since then, meaning it's got years of experience to build on as it reimagines its 2007 title for modern audiences - not to mention its further dalliances with Lovecraft in 2019's The Sinking City.


Frogwares' "full remake and substantial rewrite" of The Awakened will shift the events of the original to serve as a continuation of its young Sherlock arc, started in last year's Chapter One. As such, it'll follow a young Sherlock Holmes, along with his new acquaintance John Watson, on his first big case in London - an adventure that'll span Victorian London, a Swiss psychiactric ward, the New Orleans bayous, and the Scottish Highlands as the fledging detective wrestles with dark, Lovecraft-inspired horrors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - the promising co-op shooter/melee hybrid from Vermintide developer Fatshark - has been delayed again. It's now due for a PC release on 30th November, with the Xbox Series X/S version arriving "shortly after".


This will, of course, be the second delay for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, which was announced at the tail-end of 2020 for release the following year. Unfortunately, its development - as with many recent games - was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and Fatshark ultimately made the decision to push its launch into 2022 in order to "focus on the level of quality on release, as well as invest in more systems to support Darktide for years to come."


March finally brought the news fans had been waiting for, with Darktide receiving a 13th September release date on PC and Xbox Series X/S, but that's now shifted again.

Backbone One PlayStation Edition is identical to the existing Backbone One controller, with one key difference: it eschews the original's black colour scheme in favour of pristine white hues inspired by Sony's DualSense wireless controller. However, other familiar DualSense design elements, including parallel thumbsticks, are not replicated.


Sony is promoting the Backbone One PlayStation Edition - which is powered by the connected device - as the perfect companion to its PS Remote Play service, enabling players to stream their games from their PS4 or PS5 consoles to their iPhones using the dedicated App Store app.

The original Goat Simulator, developed by Coffee Stain Studios, launched back in 2014, delivering a daft blast of physics-based nonsense in which players took control of a goat, causing chaos, inflicting damage, and accruing points across an open-world map. 


Its goat-themed mayhem struck a chord and the game went on to sell "millions" of copies, in turn convincing Coffee Stain that a sequel was required. Goat Simulator 3 (because sequential numbering be damned) was announced earlier this year, promising, among other things, a new sandbox world known as San Angora, full of quests, collectibles, and secrets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're discussing Rockstar, and how its internal improvements may also change its games and the wider games industry.

Yesterday's eye-catching report into Rockstar discussed positive changes for employees and suggested this new company outlook could also be reflected in Grand Theft Auto 6, whenever it finally arrives. How important are these changes, and could the industry as a whole benefit? Or should we be calling some of these things out as long overdue, and simply just a bare minimum? 

Also this week, the Nier: Automata secret church/door - the apparent existence of which has been puzzling fans and the wider internet. Is it a brand new discovery? A very clever mod? Or an incredibly elaborate marketing ploy for a new Nier game by the tight-lipped Yoko Taro? Join Ed Nightingale, Ishraq Subhan, Liv Ngan and myself as we try to explain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A year ago today, the "A Better Ubisoft" group penned an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard workers which also called out Ubisoft's own management for its handling of misconduct scandals in the past. 


This group has been campaigning for improved working conditions since the company was hit with allegations of a toxic work environment, including numerous accounts of sexual harassment and assault concerning multiple employees at the company.


However, the group says, its demands for change have not been met despite Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot vowing he would do "everything in [his] power to ensure that everyone... feels welcomed, respected, and safe".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life is Strange is getting its first tie-in prose novel, titled Steph's Story. 


The book, which is set to launch on 21st March 2023, will chart the life of fan-favourite D&D lover Steph while on the road with her bandmate Izzie. 


This sounds like the time period which directly precedes last year's True Colors and its Steph-focused DLC chapter Wavelengths, which I enjoyed. That DLC included a few voice clips from Izzie in the form of memories, and hinted at a sad end to Steph's time roadtripping while in a musical duo.

The new mode, developed by support studio Beenox, has had some significant changes from the previous mode to better fit into Rebirth Island's smaller map design.

The Grim Reaper shows up with his scythe in hand, the family gathers around to send their loved one off, and a period of mourning descends upon the house. But, if a Sim has lived a good, long life, this can also be a chance for celebration in recognition of time well spent. 


However, a new glitch was accidentally introduced in a recent update for The Sims 4, and it is fast tracking this whole process. This means that some elderly sims have been dropping dead well before their time. As well as this, children are rapidly becoming teens, teens becoming young adults and so on.


Players are reporting this all happening after a visit to create-a-sim (CAS), or during the loading screens. This is even when the game's "Long Lifespan" is enabled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 7's July patch has squeaked in just before the month is up, bringing three new cars to the ever-expanding roster in the free update - and this update brings a little bit more besides. 
The cars are a fine selection, led by another Skyline but a pretty special one at that - the Group 5 Skyline Super Silhouette, a brilliantly boxy racing beast that terrorised race tracks in the 80s. If you prefer your cars with a few more curves then there's a Maserati A6GCS/53 Spyder, an early example from the Italian manufacturer that established many of the styling cues that remain to this day. Finally there's a Porsche 918 Spyder, a hypercar that's been notable in its absence from recent Gran Turismo games. 
That's all well and good, but the real star of the update is excused by the Tomica sponsorship carried on that Skyline Super Silhouette with an update to the Scapes photo mode allowing you to take your cars to toy towns and pose for snaps. It's not quite Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels, but it's a fun new feature nevertheless.

While the name might not be familiar, Cloak and Dagger Games has been steadily making a name for itself in the point-and-click genre over the last half-decade with a series of idiosyncratic short-form adventures, primarily within the realm of horror. A few of them, including deliciously creepy early title A Date in the Park, with its expert ratcheting of unease, can be played for free. 


The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is Cloak and Dagger's first new title since 2019's Lovecraft-inspired freebie The Terrible Old Man, and follows the Victorian-era adventure of antiquarian and author Thomasina Bateman as she arrives in the remote village of Bewlay after receiving a mysterious summons concerning its ancient barrows.

The mod ban accompanies the integration of Easy Anti-Cheat in an attempt to combat "malicious modded clients".


The latest debacle began earlier this week, when VRChat announced the ban and the inclusion of Easy Anti-Cheat, as well as an open beta beginning immediately to test the update. On Discord, VRChat staff member Tupper revealed they expected the update to be rolled out to all players within 24 hours.

Adding friends on Nintendo Switch has always been slightly cumbersome, but Nintendo has made a step towards making the process a bit more streamlined on its app.
You can now send friend requests from within the app by typing in a friend code, nicely complementing the update from March we reported on that allowed users to easily copy their friend code. Alternatively, you can get your friend code as a URL or QR code, which can then be used by someone else to send you a friend request.

The report centres on changes within Rockstar since the company's public reckoning with crunch in 2018, when founder Dan Houser said his team had worked "100-hour weeks" to finish Red Dead Redemption 2, and after various reports of the company's frat-house-style operation. 


Subsequent changes to working styles and benefits are part of an attempt to "reinvent" the company as a more progressive workplace, the report states, which also extends to the content featured in its games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stephane D'Astous, founder and former boss of Deus Ex developer Eidos Montreal, has described Square Enix's handling of its Western studios as a "train wreck in slow motion" in an explosive new interview. 


Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, D'Astous criticised Square Enix's past management of its various Western studios and suggested the recent sale of Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics could have been motivated by a desire to court a buyout by PlayStation.


"It was a trajectory that could be predicted," D'Astous said, discussing the decline of Square Enix's Western studios, and Eidos Montreal in particular. "I left because things were missing at head office. [Pre-Square Enix] Eidos has a great tradition of development teams, but they don't have superior knowledge of how to sell their games. And that was quite clear."

Yesterday we reported how reddit user sadfutago posted a video entering a previously unfound door that led to an unseen church area, leaving dataminers scratching their heads. Is this truly a new secret in the game, or an elaborate modded hoax?

Bloomberg said developer Aspyr fired the game's art director and design director this month, and told staff the hotly-anticipated remake is "on pause".


The dramatic decision comes after Aspyr, which has been working on the game for three years, demoed a vertical slice to Lucasfilm and publisher Sony at the end of June. Apparently Aspyr bosses told staff this demo "wasn't where they wanted it to be".

Modder KangieDanie has uploaded a splitscreen multipawer - sorry, multiplayer - mod for PC that lets you play through the campaign in local co-op.  


KangieDanie notes that the mod is in very early development so if you decide to give it a try, you're inevitably going to run into some bugs.

<blockquote><p>Lockdown Mode offers an extreme, optional level of security for the very few users who, because of who they are or what they do, may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from NSO Group and other private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Turning on Lockdown Mode in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

It's worth noting these three have only a chance to appear, and even then have a low catch and high flee rate. Still, there are already plenty of reports of players successfully acquiring at least one of them, just 12 hours in.

This left many cowboys disappointed (to put it mildly), to the extent an in-game funeral was held to mourn this loss.


While Rockstar may be jumping ship and swimming away from its Red Dead franchise, modders are not. In fact, a mod for Red Dead Redemption 2 will let you play as a totally new character of your own creation, give you a new skill tree to fill up and allow you to take on all-new heists. 
I appreciate I said 'new' quite a lot there, but it fits the bill. This is no small undertaking by the modding community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you found yourself suitably enthused for American Truck Simulator's Montana expansion following last week's 30 minutes of soothing cross-country trundling, there's some great news; it turns out developer SCS Software was somewhat underselling it when it said development was "slowly approaching the finish line" - the Montana expansion is out next week.


Montana - which will be American Truck Simulator's tenth explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, and Wyoming - launches next Thursday, 4th August, giving players the chance to admire its "glistening glacial lakes, snow-capped mountain peaks, blue-ribbon trout streams, and mighty Missouri, Yellowstone, and Flathead Rivers", all from behind the wheel.


Those curious for a glimpse at the routes American Truck Simulator's Montana expansion will unlock can get a taste of the journeys ahead in SCS' newly updated map. Montana's beautifully recreated landmarks also get an airing in the launch trailer below, but for a more genteel preview, SCS' wonderfully relaxing 30-minute sight-seeing tour is well worth your time.

Word that Ubisoft's free-to-play sports game was nearing the end of its life, despite only launching back in May, came via the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb during a segment on the Xbox Era podcast over the weekend.


In reponse, Ubisoft has now shared a statement on Twitter denying those claims and insisting "Roller Champions isn't getting cancelled. But while an imminent demise doesn't currently appear to be on the cards, Ubisoft does say it will be extending Roller Champions' current season, Disco Fever, in order to "focus on what our players have told us needs improvement".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment has delayed the launch of Lord of the Rings: Gollum once more, this time pushing its previously announced 1st September release back "by a few months".


Lords of the Rings: Gollum was announced in March 2019, promising a Middle-Earth-inspired blend of "subtle tactical stealth", environmental puzzling, climbing challenges, and "fast-paced parkour action", all playing out across a mixture of open levels and more linear missions.


Daedelic was originally aiming to launch Gollum last year, but ultimately made the decision to delay its release into 2022, although no reason was given at the time. This latest delay, though, has been made in order to "deliver the best possible experience", according to the developer.

That's according to loose-lipped journalist Jeff Grubb who, speaking as part of Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings stream, claimed the project will be single-player-only title, with EA's aim being to build on the success of developer Respawn's well-received solo adventure Jedi: Fallen Order.
While details are inevitably limited at this juncture - the title is said to be in "very early development" - Grubb claimed the basic premise is that players will need to complete various challenges in a bid to become the new Black Panther, following the death of an earlier incarnation at the start of the game.

The details, published by Vice, come from documents recently obtained by a hacker and held to ransom, before being posted online. Vice has said it has published these details to shine a light on the lengths that Western companies can be forced to go to if they decide to enter the Chinese market.


Revelations revealed in the report include instructions to Roblox employees in one internal presentation to "expect that hacking has already started" and that it would "ramp up after a deal is signed, possibly even by [Roblox's] partner".

This language uses a substitution cipher to make the world in Stray more cryptic and mysterious. (A substitution cipher is a used to encrypt text by swapping each letter or symbol within said text with a different symbol, that can then be unscrambled with a key.)
And now, HalfGlassGaming's Josh Wirtanen has cracked Stray's cipher, and shared how we too can do the same (thanks, RockPaperShotgun). I have embedded some photos from the game within this article, so if you are yet to play or are keen to avoid spoilers, please take this as your cue to read something else on Eurogamer.

While this on its own is not all that newsworthy, what makes these upcoming releases by Hasbro more interesting is that they give us all a look at Cal Kestis' new, and therefore older, image. This includes some impressively-manicured facial furniture. 
Cal's beard is groomed impeccably on the soon-to-be-released model, making me wonder how he got such a close shave. Perhaps he took cutthroat shaving to the extreme and used his lightsaber for the job? Who can say, but he has certainly grown up since the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

Modder hibrietas provides a modern staple for mods, the Jason mod. Taken from the infamous mall scene in Heavy Rain, meowing is replaced with "a pleading call to find your lost son, you terrible father".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft is now reportedly targeting a 2023 release window for its next Assassin's Creed game, which is expected to be a smaller, stealth-focused edition of the series.


Codenamed Rift (though likely not its final title), this is the Baghdad-focused project which originally began life as a Valhalla expansion. It has since grown its own fully-fledged project, albeit tighter in scope than other recent, sprawling Assassin's Creed entries.


Originally reported to arrive later this year (though still to be officially announced by Ubisoft itself), Bloomberg has now stated that Rift will arrive in either May or June 2023.

Sharing some gameplay on reddit, DanTheBloke (via exputer) explained that the latest update to Proton GE has allowed them to get online play for Halo Infinite working on their Steam Deck through the beta SteamOS.
DanTheBloke does say gameplay "can be a little janky" and there is "some clipping audio at times". Regardless though, it is definitely still playable, as you can see for yourself below.

Montana, which was confirmed to be in development last November, will be American Truck Simulator's tenth explorable state, joining California and Nevada (both of which were included at launch in 2016), alongside DLC additions Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, and Wyoming.


Setting the scene for its new expansion on Steam, SCS explains, "Montana is a gateway to Glacier and Yellowstone - two crown jewels of the national park system - and is home to glistening glacial lakes, snow-capped mountain peaks, blue-ribbon trout streams, and mighty Missouri, Yellowstone, and Flathead Rivers."

The upcoming prequel comic, titled as Gotham Knights - Gilded City, focuses on Batman as he attempts to quell the spread of a rage-inducing virus infecting Gotham City (thanks, PopVerse).  


This case is being billed as Batman's final mission before his apparently very much permanent demise, so there's likely some interesting backstory here relevant to the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known for a while that knockabout battle royale game Fall Guys would be bringing back its ludicrous Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles outfits this August, but a new leak has indicated there may be considerably more to next month's Sonic collaboration, with leakers having uncovered a new stage inspired the hedgehog's classic Green Hill Zone.


A bean-ised Sonic the Hedgehog costume initially appeared in Fall Guys all the way back in October 2020, and Knuckles made his in-store debut in November the following year. Fall Guys then continued on its merry Sonic-free way, but last month's Sonic Central livestream brought news that both character cosmetics would be returning to the game this August - as a sort of duel hoorah for Fall Guys' recent free-to-play launch and Sonic's 30th birthday - bringing with them a newcomer in the form of Tails.


That seemed to be as far developer Mediatonic and Sega planned to take their latest collaboration, but players started to suspect their might be more to come around a week ago, when a screenshot looking an awful lot like a new Green Hill Zone stage was spotted as appearing (presumably unintentionally) as part of Fall Guys' 'up next' stage select screen.

        <updated>2022-07-22T15:41:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports earlier this year that Ubisoft was in the early stages of developing a sequel to its enjoyable Greek-mythology-themed open-world adventure Immortals Fenyx Rising, new claims have surfaced suggesting this may in fact be a spin-off, rather than a full-blown sequel, and one given a new Hawaiian Polynesian theme.


The original Immortals Fenyx Rising, which released in 2020, followed the adventures of the titular Fenyx after being washed ashore on the colourful Golden Isle, home to a pantheon of Greek mythology inspired gods. What followed was a generally enjoyable blend of open-world exploration, platforming, combat, and puzzling - all narrated by the perpetually bickering twosome of Prometheus and Zeus - whose biggest flaw (aside from its rather exhaustingly stuff-saturated map) was its over-familiarity.


"Blame Covid, blame budgets, blame Ubisoft, blame the paradoxically thrifty, endlessly repurposing way the publisher makes all its huge, expansive, generous games," Christian Donlan wrote in his review, "but Immortals never really finds its own voice until the very end."

But it was the event's drag showcase that was really the talk of the convention. Capping off the first day, the TwitchCon Drag Showcase was the first event of its kind and saw over 60,000 people watching in the centre's Glitch Theatre and streaming online - many of whom had never seen a drag show before.


Not only was the drag showcase the epicentre of LGBT+ representation at the convention, it was an opportunity to highlight the diversity of talent on Twitch. There's far more to the platform than just playing video games, even if that's done in makeup and a wig.

"Developers should be free to decide how to build their games, and you are free to decide whether to play them," Sweeney wrote, "I believe stores and operating system makers shouldn't interfere by forcing their views onto others. We definitely won't."

But that won't be the case, creative director Patrick Redding said during a Q&A attended by IGN. And when Gotham Knights rolls its credits, Batman is... still dead. Huh!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following today's news that Ubisoft's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandorahas been delayed and will no longer release along James Cameron's Avatar sequel this December, the publisher has announced a number of other significant changes to its release roster, with Splinter Cell VR and Ghost Recon Frontline now officially cancelled alongside two previously unannounced games.


Ubisoft shared the news during its latest earnings call, only saying it had made the decision to cancel all four titles after taking into account the "more uncertain economic environment".


Ghost Recon Frontline, which received a less-than-stellar reception when it was announced last October, was to be a new free-to-play instalment in Ubisoft's long-running military shooter series. The core experience would have featured a large-scale, battle-royale-style 102-person mode where teams of three players completed objectives before calling for extraction, but other modes were also detailed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're discussing NFTs - and the video game industry's continued interest in trying to sell them to us.

The past 24 hours have seen two major NFT announcements from a pair of companies taking radically different stances. On the one hand, there's Square Enix, which has decided to celebrate the venerable Final Fantasy 7's 25th anniversary by launching a range of NFT mechandise. This announcement, its fair to say, has gone down like cold sick. 

On the other hand, there's Mojang - the Microsoft-owned maker of Minecraft - which has drawn a line in the sand and said it will not integrate NFTs or allow others to use Minecraft in order to sell them. Is this end for video game NFTs? Unlikely! But as the planet burns, what does the future hold? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has said it'll be giving fans to "witness what's next" for Destiny 2 as part of a developer showcase scheduled to air on 23rd August.


While Bungie's official announcement didn't share specifics about the livestream, the developer has already been extremely forthcoming regarding the next few years for Destiny 2, so it's almost certain August will see the developer showcasing its previously announced, but still mysterious, Lightfall expansion.


Revealed back in June 2020, Lightfall - which is currently expected to launch sometime in 2023 - will be Destiny 2's penultimate expansion, coming between this year's The Witch Queen and the game's finale expansion The Final Shape. Bungie previously confirmed the latter will bring Destiny's Light and Darkness Saga to a close.

The Criminal Enterprises expansion, which released on 26th July, sees the Southern San Andreas economy in crisis, with petrol prices at their highest levels in decades, supply chains in turmoil and a heatwave to top it all off. 
Sounds a little too familiar to be a satire if you ask me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An official Detroit: Become Human manga series is launching on 22nd July in Japan.
Titled as Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories, the comic will follow the story of Japan's own android revolution.


A short synopsis and some panels have been released on Famitsu in Japanese. The story is set in 2038 and stars Reina, an android idol. It seems that Tokyo Stories takes place alongside the original story of Detroit: Become Human, contrasting the largely hostile attitudes to androids seen in the game with a society that is much more accepting of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DICE is delivering a "refreshed art direction" for Battlefield 2042's Specialists in the game's next major update due next month.


The appearance of Specialists was one of the early criticisms levelled by players, who felt their clean look and rather light-hearted demeanour did not fit with the game's harsh post-climate change apocalyptic world. 


Based on rendered images posted by the developer, the Specialists have a more gritty look, with burly beards and a more serious resting face reflecting the mental scarring of warfare.

Last night, Minecraft developer Mojang posted a blog laying out a clear policy on NFTs, which it said created "models of scarcity and exclusion that conflict with our guidelines and the spirit of Minecraft". 


"To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications, nor may Minecraft in-game content such as worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods, be utilised by blockchain technology to create a scarce digital asset," Mojang confirmed.

        <updated>2022-07-20T20:25:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following January's news that New Line Cinema is working on a sequel to last year's commercially successful Mortal Kombat movie reboot, Deadline reports that project's director, Simon McQuoid, will return to the helm for part two.


Last year's movie followed the adventures of Cole Young, a former professional MMA fighter - and a new character to the series - who becomes ensnared in a plot by sorcerer Shang Tsung to eliminate the new generation of Earthrealm's Mortal Kombat champions. Despite the return of plenty of familiar faces, and a strong opening fight (which you can see below), Eurogamer's resident Mortal Kombat fan Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly impressed by the end result.


Yet despite a generally lacklustre critical reception, the Mortal Kombat movie apparently did big numbers for New Line, opening at No. 1 at the US box office and ranking among the all-time top feature titles on HBO Max, where it simultaneously released. A sequel was almost inevitable then, and New Line confirmed its plans for a follow-up in January this year.

Straley broke the news of his return in a video shared on Twitter, explaining, "In 2017, I left the industry not sure if I wanted to make games anymore, but the longer I was away, I kept thinking about this medium, and everything yet to be done and everything I wanted to do still - and this idea kept following me."


"So I grabbed some friends," Straley continued, "and we started prototyping and the idea started getting good, it started becoming exciting again, and I realised I need to make this game. But if I'm going to make this game, it means I have to build a team, and if I build a team, I have to build a company, and if we're going to do that then we have to do it the right way."

All players, meanwhile, can take advantage of Spider-Man's customisable rendering systems, including SSAO, texture filtering, LoD quality, and shadows.

Additionally, there's support for various monitor resolutions and ratios - including ultra wide, panoramic, and Nvidia Surround multi-monitor set-ups - all playable in either windowed, full-screen, or exclusive full-screen rendering modes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark's big July update has arrived, bringing with it, among other things, the new Arcanist advanced mage class, who gets things done by tossing magic cards about the place.


Alongside the Arcanist, July's update (officially titled Spells in Spades) introduces a new ultra-tough Inferno difficulty version of the Valtan Legion raid - which requires item level 1445 to participate in - plus tougher Challenge Abyssal Dungeons. This twist on standard Abyssal Dungeons is a weekly activity that, like the updated Valtan Legion raid, will feature its own increased rewards for players able to overcome its challenges.


It's undoubtedly the Arcanist that's taking centre-stage though, and she joins the Bard and Sorceress as Lost Ark's third available Mage Advanced Class. Using special cards imbued with Magick, she's able to deploy them in multiple ways, summoning powerful attacks from within the cards or simply using them in massive numbers to slice up foes.

The power shot, which is available across generations (so, for example, PS4 and PS5), is a new skill-based, risk versus reward shooting mechanic.


EA wanted to introduce more skill to shooting, the company said during a recent presentation attended by Eurogamer, so in FIFA 23, if you carve out enough space for yourself and aim precisely, you can score impressive-looking goals that have more power and accuracy, but with the risk of a longer animation.

Freighters were, of course, one of No Man's Sky's very first post-launch additions, arriving all the way back in November 2016 as part of its game-changing Foundation Update.


While the Foundation Update's other major addition, base building, has undergone several revisions in the year's since its debut, freighters - those giant, habitable, expandable space vessels Travellers are now given early on in their adventures - have not, and their limited building blocks have remained an ongoing frustration for players like me who've long dreamed of constructing something a bit more lavish for their home among the stars.

In Netflix's latest financial results, the streaming giant revealed that despite airing new seasons of front-runner Stranger Things and other popular series such as The Umbrella Academy.  


In the UK, the cost of living crisis is one of the biggest issues currently faced by households, and streaming services are feeling the impact of it. The BBC  reported that many people are choosing to cancel their subscriptions in order to compensate for increasing bills and prices. Netflix is likely one of the companies affected by this, with 300,000 of the total 970,000 subscribers lost residing in the EMEA region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog officially announced its plans to bring The Last of Us Part 1 to PlayStation 5 (and eventually PC) with a shiny new remake that will be a "total overhaul of the original experience" at Summer Game Fest last month.
The remake itself is not due out until September, however, we are already seeing gameplay leaks making their way out into the wild. Déjà vu anyone?
The most recent leaks, which have now been mostly removed from the internet by a very fast-moving Naughty Dog, showed off a scene from very early in the game's narrative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has detailed how the current heatwave will affect its Steam Deck hardware, which will shut down completely in high temperatures. 


Even before this happens, performance will be "throttled" when the hardware is hot, Valve has said. Honestly, after the past couple of days, I can relate. 


"For our friends in the midst of a heatwave, a quick note about Steam Deck in high temperatures," Valve wrote via Twitter last night. "Steam Deck performs at its best in ambient temperatures between zero and 35°C. If the temperature gets higher than this, Steam Deck may start to throttle performance to protect itself."

In fact, it has become the biggest PC launch ever for publisher Annapurna Interactive (which I feel should rename itself Anna-purr-na for the occassion).
At the time of writing, there are 34,139 players on Steam making their four-legged way around Stray's environments, with an overall peak of 62,963.
Figures posted by Steam tracker Benji-Sales show a launch far higher than other recent Annapurna titles.

Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, a sequel to developer Troika Games' much-loved 2004 cult-classic RPG, was initially announced for PC and consoles back in 2019, when it was expected to release the following year. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for the project to run into trouble and, later in 2019, Hardsuit Labs announced the first of several delays.


By the end of 2020, lead narrative designer Brian Mitsoda and creative director Ka'ai Cluney had been fired from their roles, senior narrative designer Cara Ellison had quit the project, and Paradox had revised Bloodlines 2's release date once more, pushing it into 2021. Then, things went from bad to worse; as 2021 got underway Paradox announced it had removed Hardsuit from the project, delayed the game indefinitely, and cancelled new pre-orders.

Following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v Wade at the end of June, publishers and developers around the world - including Microsoft, Ubisoft, EA, Bungie, Naughty Dog, Double Fine, and Bethesda - released statements in support of reproductive rights. Take-Two was one of the few major publishers, alongside Activision Blizzard, not to respond publicly to the news.


Three weeks on, though, Take-Two has now released its own statement across a limited number of social media channels, including its own LinkedIn page and subsidiary Zynga's Twitter feed.

Romero shared the news in a statement posted to Twitter, revealing the project is being handled by Romero Games - which most recently worked on mafia strategy title Empire of Sin for publisher Paradox Interactive - and that it would be built around an "original, new" IP.


Beyond that, details are thin - the official FAQ says "it's way too early to share any other information" - with the remainder of the announcement only noting Romero Games is currently hiring across a range of positions for its new FPS, and that it's particularly keen to hear from those with experience using Unreal Engine 5.

To accompany this announcement, we also got a nice shiny new trailer to pour over. This is full of beam katanas, a general sense of mass destruction and Travis' cat Jeane - what's not to love?! You can check it out for yourself below.

Yesterday, Collider published photos taken by a reader from Staten Island in New York. 


The photos show the exterior set of a Super Duper Mart with some sleek, round-bodied cars ripped straight from the 1950s parked outside, rusted all over. The building itself isn't doing much better, sporting the grime and abandoned wear you would expect to see roaming around Fallout 4's post-apocalyptic Boston.

In anticipation of this release, its developers have been sharing little snippets of what we can expect, with the most recent one giving us a closer look at Melee Island's dock, an eerie-looking ship and the outside of the Scumm Bar. 
"New surveillance video for #MonkeyIslandMonday!," tweeted developer Dave Grossman. "Strange man seen striding purposefully on Melee dock, ignoring the pelicans and bar as though he had somewhere to be, some devilish puzzle to solve..."
That strange man is, of course, none other than series hero Guybrush Threepwood. Can you believe he passed up the opportunity to quench his thirst with a healthy pint of grog? Something must be afoot.

Vikander, who took on the axe wielding, bow and arrow shooting role of Lara Croft in the most recent Tomb Raider film, spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the sequel, saying that she has "no clue" how things will go from here. "With the MGM and Amazon buyout... its kind of politics," she explained. 
That being said, Vikander is just waiting for the sequel to be given the green light once more. "I think Misha [Green, who is currently attached to the project as its writer and director] and I have been ready, so it's kind of in somebody else's hands, to be honest," she shared.

Leone sent threatening messages from his Twitter account, about his desire to "burn down" Bungie's offices and declaring certain Bungie employees were "not safe" as he intended to move to their neighbourhood - including community manager Dylan Gafner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There had been rumblings amongst the gaming community that Motion Twin's roguelike Dead Cells was coming to the end of its lifespan. Thankfully, this is not the case. Rather, the developer has released a new roadmap for the game that covers the rest of this year, and into 2023.
So, what can you expect to see heading your way? Well, for summer 2022, Dead Cells players should see the arrival of "the long awaited panchaku" as well as a new "flame head outfit based on our beloved animated trailers". There will also be some rebalancing for various weapons and other items, but most endearingly you will soon be able to "pet the pets".
Following this, autumn will see a new Boss Rush area enter the game. As with boss rush modes from other games (looking at you Metroid Dread), this area will let you test your metal against a series of Dead Cell's bosses one after the other. As you progress, you will unlock new items to help you on your way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following from its release on PlayStation, Xbox and PC last year, publisher Microids has announced that Oddworld: Soulstorm is coming to Switch. Specially 'oddtimised' to run on the Switch's hardware, the game follows series protagonist Abe after the events of Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. 
Although the release date hasn't been announced yet, preorders are now open for the physical Limited and Collector's Odditions, the latter of which includes an exclusive nine-inch figurine of Abe and a 160-page artbook. Any pre-orders from participating retailers of the Limited or Collector's Odditions will also include the game's OST and a digital artbook. Sounds like some tasty goodies for any Oddworld fans.
In our Oddworld: Soulstorm review, Christian Donlan felt the game's magical moments and brutal setting were well worth the few rough edges. With the UK currently feeling the effects of climate change, perhaps this is a good time to revisit a game where you can live out your fantasy of destroying a means of capitalist production.

As part of San Diego Comic-Con, the company has constructed an absolute behemoth Mighty Bowser, measuring over 14ft tall.


The retail version of Mighty Bowser is, of course, already pretty sizeable, weighing in at 2,807 pieces, making it the largest Lego Mario adult set yet. However, the San Diego version absolutely crushes that like a sudden Thwomp to the bonce, utilising over 663,900 bricks to create its magnificent heft.


And if that wasn't enough, the 14-ft tall version is even articulated, able to move its thumbs, shift its arms, swivel its head and eyes indepently, and waggle its eyebrows for good measure. You can see the (slightly intimidating) thing in action below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as Netflix's live-action Resident Evil series finds itself flung unceremoniously onto the 'disappointment' pile, news arrives of another video game being adapted for television - this time in the form of Obsidian's inch-high garden adventure Grounded.


Released into early access back in July 2020, Grounded adapts the familiar gathering-and-crafting survival formula into a rollicking family friendly adventure inspired by the likes of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and A Bug's Life. Here, players are miniaturised and sent on a conspiracy laden escapade around their now-towering backyard, forced to fend off giant insects and other creatures as they explore, scavenge, and plot their escape.


According to Deadline, Grounded's new television adaptation will follow the same basic premise, telling the story of four friends who, the summer before high school, find their plans to elevate their social standing upended after discovering shrinking technology that makes them two inches tall. "Now the four shrunken friends must learn to survive in a towering backyard that's a jungle full of enormous predators," explains Deadline, "and hiding a vast corporate conspiracy threatening their entire town."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fall Guys players have a phallic treat awaiting them in their inventories right now, with developer Mediatonic handing out troublingly elongated Tall Guys to one and all following its recent, widely publicised cock-up.


Fall Guys' Tall Guys disemination doesn't, admittedly, appear to be directly related to the recent snafu - which saw players recieving snotty customer service responses after a bug in the game caused them to auto-buy cosmetics - but developer Mediatonic presumably won't say no to the positive publicity right now.


One look at the image accompanying Mediatonic's promise of a "BIG surprise" for all Fall Guys players on Twitter today makes it abundantly clear where the developer's mind was at the time, but the good (?) news is the actual in-game Tall Guys are marginally less phallic than they appear in their promo material - as you can see below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a bit of bad news for anyone looking forward to the arrival of free-to-play arena shooter Star Wars: Hunters; developer Zynga has announced it's delaying the game's full release into 2023 in order to ensure it "meets the high expectations we are setting".


This isn't the first delay for Star Wars: Hunters, of course; announced back in February 2021 for Switch, iOS, and Android, the game was originally expected to launch later that year, but eventually saw its full release pushed into 2022. Zynga has, however, managed to soft launch the game in select territories in the interim, so there are at least some players who've had the opportunity to try it in that time.


Announcing a second delay for the game's full release on Twitter, Zynga explained, "We are working tirelessly to achieve our vision for Star Wars: Hunters. Our ambition is to create a competitive battle arena game that will entertain for years to come. To ensure we meet the high epgetation we are setting for fans globally and ourselves as developers we have made the decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters [to 2023]."

But while she may not have popped up in the series prior to Village, we could yet see her again elsewhere. Andrew Dabb, showrunner for Netflix's divisive new Resident Evil series, is also a fan of Lady D, and has said he'd like to bring her to the TV adaptation in future seasons. 
Speaking to Polygon, Dabb revealed: "Over the course of the series, I want to bring everything in... Left to my own devices, I want Lady D, I want the plant monster, I want it all."

The company cited "unforeseen logistical challenges" as the reason for this delay, before going on to apologise for any inconvenience this decision may have caused.
However, all is far from lost. If you had your heart set on this Collector's Edition of the game, you will obvisouly still have the chance to purchase Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on its release. After that, you will be able to get your hands on this edition's contents separately without the game itself.

As Dusk Falls is the first game from new studio Interior/Night, which formed as a breakaway from the controversial Heavy Rain developer Quantic Dream. For more on all that, Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale recently visited the studio to sit down with its founder Caroline Marchal.

As well as those already released, there are also numerous titles in the pipeline, from Fallout and The Last of Us to Horizon and God of War. There have even been talks of Life is Strange making its way to the live-action small screen. 
But one video game franchise that has already seen numerous adaptations is Resident Evil. We have been gifted with big budget live action films and CG miniseries over the years. 
Now there's yet another take on the zombie-filled world of Racoon City, thanks to Netflix. This show follows Jade Wesker (daughter of series regular Albert Wesker) as she fights to survive in a world overrun by blood-thirsty infected creatrures. So, some pretty standard Resident Evil stuff. The being said though, this newest release doesn't seem to be striking a chord with its viewers. In fact, it is one of Netflix's lowest-rated shows ever.

Both the PlayStation Plus Extra (£10.99/month) and Premium (£13.49/month) options will now give you seven days to try the service before being billed. 


It's worth noting these trials are not available separately - you are essentially selecting to sign up to Extra/Premium via their various monthly/three-monthly/annual billing options, and just get seven days free up front.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of its monumental acquisition by Microsoft, Activision now has an official publisher page on Steam.
In recent years, the company has favoured Battle.net for its PC games. However, this new page on Steam suggests that Activision is readying itself for the completion of the biggest deal in gaming history.
Fans of Activision's various franchises have taken to forums such as Reddit and ResetEra to share their feelings about this move by Activision. In short, everyone is hopeful about what this might mean for the developer's various games on PC (ahem, Tony Hawk).

Skip to the 9:50 mark in the video below and you'll hear the studio team discussing victory conditions, and see an exhaustive list of factions noted under the heading "Domination Campaign Victory".


Intriguingly, this list includes four factions new to the Total War: Warhammer series and unannounced so far. These, fans reckon, are likely candidates for DLC in future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report states that Russia is looking into making its own game engine. This comes as support from other companies has been pulled following Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine. 
The report by Kommersant (via PC Gamer) states that "a number of major players in the Russian IT market including VK" [Russia's own Facebook alternative] are currently in talks with the Ministry of Digital Development to create a "domestic game engine (a means of developing video games) and the possibility of allocating state funding for it."
Talks regarding this new engine began in May, when Russian developers allegedly voiced their concerns that they will soon have limited access to other engines such as Unreal or Unity. During these talks, the initiative was described as "important and urgent" for Russia's video game developers.

This bug is linked to the game's lens flare, developer FuturLab has said, and can occur on Xbox consoles when playing in multiplayer. 


Reducing the amount of time you look at the sun "isn't a great workaround", the developer admitted via a post to Twitter. But until a hotfix (sorry) is rolled out, it's all there is. And, y'know, not looking directly at the sun is just solid advice in general.

Earlier this week, Riccitiello was slammed for stating that mobile developers who don't seek to squeeze monetisation from their smartphone games represented only "a very small portion of the gaming industry", calling them "the most beautiful and pure, brilliant people" that were also "some of the biggest fucking idiots".

After insisting the interview was "clickbait" and "out of context", Riccitiello has now apologised for his "crude word choice" and said if he had been "smart in choosing [his] words" he would have said that he is "working to provide developers with tools so they can better understand what their players think, and it is up to them to act or not, based on this feedback".

As noted by our colleagues at our sister site GamesIndustry.biz, the government today told game publishers that the luxury of regulating itself will cease if it does not take control of the sale of loot boxes to children and young people as those that use loot boxes are "more likely to experience gambling, mental health, financial, and problem gaming-related harms".

Back in June 2020, the UK Government announced it would launch a call for evidence on loot boxes in response to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) inquiry into immersive and addictive technologies, and began inviting responses from the public in September.

Pre-orders are now open for the four different editions of God of War Ragnarök - the most expensive of which, the Jotnar Edition, is priced at £230. As Tom explained at the time, this includes lots of fancy physical items and a digital code for the game - but no disc.

Given the limited numbers, it probably comes as no surprise that already the more collectible editions have already sold out on official retail sites like GAME and the official PlayStation Store. And, perhaps even more predictably enough, it looks like too many scalpers have laid their dirty hands on the pre-orders (or pretending to, anyway) and are listing them on auction places for massively inflated prices online.

Whilst previously, the menu offered the choice of either a "male" or "female" body type, Blizzard has now removed gendered language and now simply offers the choice between "Body 1" and "Body 2". 

"The new body type labels are merely text changes within the character creation screen and barber shop," explains Wowhead (thanks, NME). "Where it previously gave players the option to select Male or Female body types, it now simply refers to them as Body 1 and Body 2 respectively."

The Duviri Paradox will be Warframe's latest open-world expansion, following the likes of Plains of Eidolon and Heart of Deimos, and plunges players into the extremely weird world of Duviri, featuring a sort of fantasy western aesthetic shot through with floating islands and fractals.


It's also a world that appears to exist inside of the head of new big bad Dominus Thrax, who additionally serves as its less-than-benevolent ruler. Everyone living within Thrax's domain is trapped inside an endless time loop, doomed to be executed over and over and over again.

Soulframe will be Digital Extremes' first new game in over five years, following on from 2017's short-lived team-based FPS The Amazing Eternals, but details remain slight at this juncture.


Like its predecessor, Soulframe will adopt a free-to-play model when it eventually arrives at some unspecified future point, and Digital Extremes has shared a few additional details in an interview with The Washington Post. Here, it explains Soulframe will be built around "slow and heavy" melee combat, have a focus on exploration, and will feature a hub world similar to Warframe's open-world planets. That world is said to be "a little angry about what's been done to it", causing the ground to shift throughout the day - leading to some proceduralism within the (presumably explorable) cave networks and crevasses beneath its surface.

That's according to Business Insider Poland, which says that the disastrous launch of Cyberpunk 2077 has wiped the value of the then most-valuable games company in Europe from over 40 billion Polish złoty - that's around £7.11bn - to less than zł10 billion - about £1.77bn.

The drop in CD Projekt's value - whilst still remaining one of Poland's most valuable companies - reportedly takes it back to a value last seen around 2017.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has made further changes to its Overwatch 2 hero roster in another beta mid-cycle patch.

Six more heroes have had their abilities tweaked in a bid to rebalance the game ahead of its formal release, including Doomfist, Junker Queen, Orisa, Sojourn, Symmetra, and Zenyatta.

Doomfist's changes include minimum damage required to empower Rocket Punch reduced from 100 to 90 damage, and the movement speed penalty while blocking reduced from 50 to 35 per cent. They will also now deal damage to all enemies knocked back "instead of only the first target impacted".

The issue first popped up on the game's subreddit, with dozens of players complaining that items had been "auto-purchased" when previewing them in Fall Guys' in-game store.

Other issues included Show Bucks going mysteriously missing, hidden key bindings triggering purchases, items being switched after selection, and "a lot of players" finding that they inexplicably have "less currency now".

Research firm NPD Group - which originally asserted Elden Ring was one of the top 10 best-selling games in history before retracting the claim due to "incomplete data" - reports in an updated statement that From Software's action RPG has "placed first in dollar sales in four of its first five months in market", is the best-selling game of June 2022, and remains "the best-selling game of 2022 year to date".

"Elden Ring repeated as the best-selling game of the month, and it remains the best-selling game of 2022 year to date," NPD said in the revised statement. "Elden Ring has placed first in dollar sales in four of its first five months in market."

Sony announced it would buy Bungie for $3.6bn back in February. At the time, Sony boss Jim Ryan stated the purchase was "an important step in [Sony's] strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a much wider audience".

Despite a probe by the FTC that sought to review "the latest example of how aggressive the agency is becoming in reviewing mergers", the agreement has now formally "closed" and Sony has posted across its social media channels to "officially" welcome Bungie to "the PlayStation family".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves' long-long-long-awaited Captaincy Update, first discussed prior to the game's release all the way back in 2018, will miss its planned launch later this month and is now due to arrive alongside Season Seven on 4th August.
In its originally envisaged 2018 guise, the Captaincy Update was an early victim of Sea of Thieves' rocky launch, with Rare ultimately making the decision to place it "on the back burner" while it refocused its development plans. Most assumed it was lost to time after that, but, to everyone's surprise, it suddenly resurfaced during Microsoft's not-E3 showcase this June.
This new iteration of Captaincy follows the same basic premise of the originally teased update, introducing a host of new features designed around the idea of becoming the captain of your own distinctive vessel. These will include the ability to name your ship, decorate its cabin, earn unique rewards, make use of special new cash-in points across the ocean, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up until now, The Sims 4 has presented itself as an enthusisatically flexi-sexual world, where every Sim is open to at least considering all attempts to woo and WooHoo. That'll soon change, however, with an imminent update giving The Sims 4 players the opportunity to define their Sims' sexual orientations in a way that better reflects the real world.


Arriving as part of a free update accompanying The Sims 4's next major expansion, High School Years, which launches on 28th July, the feature will add a new Sexual Orientation tab to the game's Create-A-Sim screen. Here, player will have the opportunity to tinker with three settings that will impact how Sims interact with others in-game.


The first option enables players to choose whether a Sim is romantically attracted to men, women, both, or neither, meaning they'll turn down romantic advances made by Sims that don't fit that profile. Incidentally, while discussing the feature during its latest livestream, developer Maxis explained it's currently using gender binary terms (despite making strides to add more inclusive pronoun options) for technical reasons relating to how The Sims 4, which is built on eight-year-old architecture, currently handles gender behind the scenes. It notes, however, that it hopes to expand the feature to encompass more gender identities over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has detailed a long-lost title from Totally Games, the developer best remembered for its work on the X-Wing series. Known as Knights of Decayden, it was planned as an early exclusive for the original Xbox before its cancellation and subsequent fade into obscurity.


Totally Games was, of course, a big deal back in the 1990s, having made a name for itself with LucasArts' hugely popular series of Star Wars space shooters, which included the likes of X-Wing, Tie Fighter, and X-Wing Alliance. Sadly, the studio closed in 2015, following a string of critically and commercially disappointing releases - but fans will likely get a kick out of a new Axios report detailing a fantasy flight combat game the developer was working on in partnership with Microsoft at the height of its success.


Knights of Decayden (other titles reportedly included alternative spelling Knights of Decadyn and Project Archipelago) was initially pitched to Sony under the name Knights of Utu for release on PS2, but eventually found its way under Microsoft's wing, with the plan being to release it as an Xbox exclusive in the year following the fledgling console's 2001 launch.

Riccitiello raised eyebrows when discussing developers who don't prioritise monetisation as part of their creative process.


"It's a very small portion of the gaming industry that works that way," Riccitiello told PocketGamer.biz, "and some of these people are my favorite people in the world to fight with - they're the most beautiful and pure, brilliant people. They're also some of the biggest fucking idiots."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pre-orders are now open for the many different editions of God of War Ragnarök - the most expensive of which, the Jotnar Edition, is priced at £230. This includes lots of fancy physical items and a digital code for the game - but no disc.


As detailed last week, Ragnarök will be available in four separate editions upon launch in November. 


Slightly less expensive, and also without a disc, the God of War Ragnarök Collector's Edition costs £180. The Digital Deluxe edition costs £80 - as you might expect from the name, there's no disc there either. Finally, a standard digital/disc copy of the game costs £70 on PS5, or £60 on PS4 (where there's a £10 upgrade option).

Details on the new venture - currently being referred to as "Aliens" - are pretty scarce right now, with Survios only saying it'll feature an original storyline set somewhere between the events of Alien and Aliens, with players taking on the role of a "battle hardened veteran [with] a vendetta against the Xenomorphs".


Given Survios' background as a primarily VR-focused developer - it's worked on the likes of Creed: Rise to Glory, The Walking Dead Onslaught, and Puzzle Bobble 3D: Vacation Odyssey - it won't be much of a surprise to hear its new Aliens project is also be getting the VR treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans eagerly awaited fresh news of EA's highly-anticipated new Skate game have been given their wish, but it mighn't be quite what they were expecting. EA and developer Full Circle have shared a new 18-minute video, announcing, among other things, that their long-awaited skateboarding revival will be a free-to-play live-service game.


Despite having variously been known as both Skate 4 and a Skate reboot since its development was announced in 2020, Full Circle now says the game "isn't a sequel, it's not a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel." Instead, it's described as an "authentic evolution" of the series - one whose last mainline entry arrived 12 years ago - that reflects "where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world".


Full Circle also dropped an official name in the form of "Skate." (that fullstop is here to stay it seems), and a new setting in San Vansterdam - described as a sister city to previous games' San Vanelona.

It does promises a fresh story campaign, in which players once again take on the role of an agent allied to the Strategic Homeland, delivering a "new perspective on key story events".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - also available in audio form! - it's all about Nintendo Switch, which is quietly having yet another brilliant year.

The last few days have seen confirmation of a new Kirby game and a Bayonetta 3 release date (finally!), adding to a solid year so far and a strong end to 2022 which will also see the likes of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Splatoon 3, Mario Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It's a bumper crop - especially compared to this year's lack of first-party launches on PlayStation and - most of all - Xbox.

At the same time, the way Nintendo is detailing these games is changing. Notably, there's been no big E3 week Nintendo Direct this year, as the company keeps information on Zelda and Metroid under wraps.

<blockquote><p>The findings, which NJIT researchers will present at the Usenix Security Symposium in Boston next month, show how an attacker who tricks someone into loading a malicious website can determine whether that visitor controls a particular public identifier, like an email address or social media account, thus linking the visitor to a piece of potentially personal data.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, the page can capture your IP address, but this doesn&#8217;t necessarily give the site owner enough information to individually identify you. Instead, the hack analyzes subtle features of a potential target&#8217;s browser activity to determine whether they are logged into an account for an array of services, from YouTube and Dropbox to Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and more. Plus the attacks work against every major browser, including the anonymity-focused Tor Browser...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

That's according to producer Naoki Yoshida speaking to Famitsu (and translated by VGC) in an extensive new interview on the game.


"I'm from a generation that grew up with command and turn-based RPGs," said Yoshida. "I think I understand how interesting and immersive it can be. On the other hand, for the past decade or so, I've seen quite a number of opinions saying 'I don't understand the attraction of selecting commands in video games'.

According to preliminary data analysed by research firm Gartner, sales fell by 12.6 percent year-on-year to 72.01m units. 


Gartner puts the decline down to three main causes: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis caused by inflation and steep downturn in demand for Chromebooks.

Iron Galaxy Studios, which is perhaps best known as the developer behind the 2013 version of Killer Instinct, announced Rumbleverse during last year's Game Awards, describing the 40-person, melee-focused battle royale game as "big, hilarious playground where spectacular things are always happening".


It was initially due to launch into early access on 8th February this year, but Iron Galaxy opted to delay its release indefinitely, saying "there's more we want to do to perfect the experience."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortality: An Interactive Movie Trilogy - the upcoming Hollywood-inspired  investigative horror game from Her Story and Telling Lies creator Sam Barlow - has been delayed until 30th August to "ensure the experience is as polished as possible".


Immortality, which was initially due to launch on 26th July, tells the story of Marissa Marcel, a (fictional) actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.


As with Barlow's previous titles, it's a story presented in non-linear fashion that players must slowly piece together themselves by scouring through reams of FMV video. But while Her Story featured faux police interview footage and Telling Lies chose "hacked" webcam video as its medium of choice, Immortality asks players to dig through an archive of film and behind-the-scenes footage - using a machine resembling an old-fashioned Moviola editing device - to find out what happened to Marissa Marcel.

Shredder's Revenge has, of course, gone down a storm since its release on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Eurogamer's Christian Donlan was just one of many to be won over by its charmingly reinvigorated classic side-scrolling brawling action (which comes with a bunch of pleasing mod-cons, including online co-op support for up to six players), calling it a "wonderful thing, colourful, pacey, and filled with perfect Turtles music."


Clearly, with Shredder's Revenge having now officially surpassed the 1m sales mark - as announced on Twitter - plenty of others have equally been in the mood for Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael's retro return.

Posted to reddit by user ZeoNyph, the video replaces the models of Arcane's heroes with Mass Effect's main characters. So, in place of Arcane's sister stars Vi and Jynx, we have FemShep and Liara - a little generous to the latter perhaps, though both Liara and Jynx are associated with the colour blue.


Next up, there's brief shots of boring Kaiden Alenko swapped into the place of Jayce, fan-favourite engineer fangirl Tali in the place of Viktor, and then space bro Garrus - who as a cop gets the spot of Caitlyn.

"The titular Umbra Witch must face a mysterious evil using her signature guns and time-slowing Witch Time ability," Nintendo writes. "This time, invading man-made bioweapons called Homunculi find themselves in Bayonetta's crosshairs."

This includes the potential of any changes to the look of its main character, the cheerleader Juliet Starling, who spends the game slashing through hordes of zombies in a skimpy outfit. 


A new statement on the remake was posted to Twitter last night by producer Yoshimi Yasuda, in a bid to clear up fan confusion over several lines from the project's original announcement.

"While we understand you're excited to get into the game, we encourage you to be careful when downloading files from unknown sources (and remind you of the potential consequences of breaking EA's Terms of Service)," Full Circle wrote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When was the last time you played a game on Facebook? Well, Meta is hoping to tempt you back to its platform with an interesting prospect: a daily, choice-based narrative experience taking place over the course of the next four months, titled The Walking Dead: Last Mile.


A massively interactive live event (MILE), the project is a collaboration between publisher Genvid, which specialises in these part-game, part-interactive stream, part-live show creations, with design and narrative input from The Walking Dead's team at Skybound and funding from Facebook.


The big sell is that Last Mile is a new chapter of The Walking Dead's lore, which will unfold across the next couple of months based upon decisions made by players, with the resulting narrative becoming franchise "canon" in line with the original comic books.  And for fans of Telltale's The Walking Dead games, there's a clear influence in art style and design language, if not gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new novel based in the Halo universe is coming to stores on 9th August.
This book, which is called Halo: The Rubicon Protocol, will act as a prequel to Halo Infinite and tells of the six months before Master Chief wakes up and the game's campaign begins.
It sounds like this will offer up some useful bits of background information for those who started Halo Infinite and found themselves a touch confused by what exactly was going on. While some of this history can be picked up in-game thanks to some well-placed audio logs, it could definitely be made clearer for players from the off.

Along with this new mod for The Elder Scrolls 5, the Together team has also shared a little update about its purpose. Calling it a "passion project" by a small handful of volunteers, the developer revealed it had tested it out with "30+ players", although this did not strictly make it an MMO. 
"The aim of the mod is to develop a true Skyrim multiplayer experience that brings online multiplayer into this otherwise strictly single player game," the Together team explained, stating it is aimed for use by two to eight players at a time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Low sales of the Wii U weren't the only reason Nintendo decided to not offer dual GamePad support on its somewhat underwhelming console. The decision was also due to a general lack of suitable games to actually make its implementation worthwhile, former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has said.
Speaking to MinnMax, Fils-Aimé stated: 
"What was interesting is that with the Wii U, there was a full development plan for all of the interesting interactions and all of the interesting capabilities that the system could do, and so in that case, technically could multiple gamepads communicate with a Wii U? Answer was 'yes', but the install base never got large enough that that type of implementation made sense."

Whilst not quite as impactful as the last patch, the game's Steam page explains how the update hopes to address "exploits and stability issues".

The long bulletpointed list includes mostly quality of life (QoL) fixes, but some new game server settings will now enable server operator to "limit the amount of processing time the gamer server can spend on processing packets for each client per tick". Clients that send packets causing server CPU processing time to exceed the configured number of milliseconds will be kicked.

Known only as "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title", the game is clearly in the very early stages, but already the team is looking to bring a host of new developers on to what seems to be a singleplayer shooter that will be a "brand new Respawn single-player adventure".

Respawn's careers page, first noticed by Dextero, is currently hiring for numerous projects, including Apex Legends, its Mobile equivalent, the upcoming Star Wars FPS, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Fallen Order's recently announced sequel. But also included in the list is that Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title, too.

That's according to producer Mariko Sato, who told IGN (via NME) that the remaster will be "visually aligned and up to the standards of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake", meaning it should run at 120fps on PC, and 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X.

As for Nintendo Switch? Sato reportedly didn't expand on that, only saying that there would be “differences” in the resolution and FPS on Nintendo's handheld system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has confirmed that it will be tweaking both Mercy and Symmetra in the Overwatch 2 beta mid-cycle patch.

In a blog on the official website, Blizzard said that the team has been hard at work "compiling player feedback, [and] squashing bugs", and revealed that part of this will be revisiting Mercy's changes in light of fan feedback.

Healer Mercy received some minor nerfs when the beta test kicked off, such as her character automatically launching into the air when reaching an ally. Now, however, Blizzard is changing it so that you can decide if and when to jump… even though it seems as though that particular ability was a complete accident in the first place.

According to ResetEra's BlackBate - a mysterious poster who's correctly leaked games ahead of schedule before - it looks like subscribers to Sony's top two PS+ tiers will see the following games join the collection: Stray (which ties in with what we already knew), FFVII Remake Intergrade + FF7R EPISODE INTERmission, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, Assassin's Creed Unity, Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered, Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry, Assassin's Creed The Ezio Collection, and Saints Row IV: Re-Elected.

BlackBate reckons the games will join the PS Plus library on 19th July - yes, Stray's release date - and states that these are only "some of the games", perhaps hinting there are more to come.

Megill - who was previously lead writer for the project and is who we have to "thank" for those nightmareish puppets in Control - made the announcement on Twitter, saying she had some "exciting news to end the week".

Megill's CV is an impressive one, featuring story-rich games such as Control - for which she was also narrative lead - Dishonored: Death of the Outsider, and Ubisoft's upcoming Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

In a brief update posted yesterday on the official website, Blizzard said it would now treat the MOBA in a "manner similar to our other longstanding games, StarCraft and StarCraft II" by continuing seasonal rolls and hero rotations, but with no plans for new "for-purchase content to be added".

As a thank you to all who've stuck with the game, Blizzard is offering the "incredibly rare" Epic Arcane Lizard mount to all players with next week’s patch.

Agent 47 is certainly not one to stay put for long, and he is now readying himself for his next holiday (sorry, I mean mission). While many of us can only dream of having the opportunity to see the world as readily as he does, for Agent 47 this is all just part of a standard day. So, what of his next destination? 
Well, once you set yours and 47's feet onto the tropical isles of Ambrose Island you will most definitely be stepping into dangerous territory. In fact, you will be stepping into pirate territory. So, you had better get ready for your buckles to be swashed. You can check out the new reveal trailer below.

A new trailer for the upcoming release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has given us all a closer look at gameplay. Here, we see the titular Gollum scaling walls, skulking in the shrubbery, and popping off orcs with rocks. 
We also get to have a closer look at some of the other characters from Middle-earth. These include Gandalf and the elven king Thranduil, a mysterious new elf (who I suspect may be Mel from the preview I was invited to earlier this year), the Nazgûl and the eight-legged wonder Shelob. You can check it out for yourself below.

Previously-announced plans to make Facebook logins a requirement for Meta VR headsets had been hugely unpopular and plagued with problems. 


Now, we know roughly when and how an alternative plan will be put into practice: in August, and via the launch of a fresh, pared-back account system with a separate social profile named Meta Horizon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the heels of The Quarry, another horror-filled game from Supermassive is coming our way. This time, we're heading back to its Dark Pictures series, with The Devil in Me.
A new trailer for this upcoming release has given us two things. The first is a launch window of this autumn. The second is an unnerving look at the game's Saw-like story, which sees a group of film makers make their way to to a replica of the 'Murder House' of HH Holmes, America's first serial killer. Obviously, things are not going to go smoothly for our group of intrepid young'uns.
Unlike previous entries in its Dark Pictures series, The Devil in Me does not appear going down the paranormal or supernatural route. Rather, it looks to be rooted in a pretty grim but very believable reality akin to the aforementioned Saw and the Hostel series of films. There are traps for our unsuspecting victims to trigger, there're torture rooms, there is tension, and there are some creepy-as mannequins. You can see for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Puzzle League for the N64 will be the next Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack game, Nintendo has announced. 


Originally launched in 2000, this pocket monster puzzler plays similarly to Panel de Pon, albeit with tiles themed around Pokémon types.


Perhaps my favourite thing about it is the game's heavily influence from the early days of the Pokémon anime - so expect appearances and slightly distorted sound clips from Ash, Misty, Brock and Team Rocket as you clear tiles. Here's a refresher:

<blockquote><p>Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE’s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has ­ without any judicial, legislative or public oversight ­ reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It sounds a lot like Marvel's Avengers will get She-Hulk as a playable character. 


The detail was dropped rather unexpectedly last night, as part of an official Xbox Twitch livestream for the game featuring streamer Frank "Techniq" Ellerbe and Marvel's Avengers lead designer Brian Waggoner. 


In an off-the-cuff comment, Ellerbe claimed his acting coach was actually the voice of She-Hulk in the game, to the obvious surprise of Waggoner - who stated that the character had not yet been officially confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games had plans to release a remaster of both Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto 4, a new report has claimed. 
However, in light of the pretty poor reception following its GTA trilogy release last year (yes, I am being generous here), the company has now apparently put these ideas to one side.
Sources with knowledge of Rockstar's inner workings have now confirmed to Kotaku that recent rumours to this effect were indeed true, and we were meant to be getting a shiny new upgrade for both games. Last year's release of the GTA trilogy came as a real blow to Rockstar, however, and now the company is hoping to put all of that bad press behind it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a three-year hiatus due to Covid, Pokémon Go's in-person Go Fests have properly returned. The first of three music festival-sized city gatherings took place this weekend in Berlin and went off smoothly, with the usual mix of rare creatures, boosted Shiny chances and early access to new species.


As ever, it was the feeling of playing Pokémon Go among thousands of others that made the event something special. Along the many pretty paths circling Berlin's beautiful Britzer Garden, thousands of Pokémon players plodded along in groups, with friends or in couples, celebrating rare catches or looking on in envy. 


I wasn't certain about Berlin as a choice for Go Fest, after the smaller German city of Dortmund hosted the game's main European events in previous years so successfully. Not only did Dortmund have a great city park to play in, but its main centre was small enough that when Pokémon Go players turned up, they absolutely took over - fans flooding its small squares and filling restaurant terraces. It created a carnival atmosphere, and seeing the expressions of bemused locals as dozens of people passed by in Pikachu onesies never got old.

However, an extra run of the game's Blade Wolf DLC was offered as a charity donation goal incentive, but Mekarazium has since admitted this run was faked using pre-recorded footage, as PCGamesN reported.

The latest of these shows off an upcoming multiplayer stage for us all to run amok in called Mincemeat Metalworks.
"Squid Research Lab here with a meaty discovery - this is rare imagery of a new multiplayer stage," the Splatoon team tweeted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study has forecast how the video games industry will perform over the course of 2022, and suggests a year-on-year decline following a strong period of growth. 


The sale of games, consoles and subscription services contributed to a enormous $191bn global total in 2021, which will fall slightly to $188bn this year, according to Ampere Analysis. 


This follows extraordinary growth through the early stages of the pandemic, with a leap in spending especially noticable from 2020 onwards.

NetEase invested $100m in Bungie back in 2018, though the companies have never officially confirmed what the two are working on.

Considering how recently this launched, that is some pretty good going!
In addition to this, the company also revealed that Monster Hunter Rise itself has also passed 10m units sold since its release.
Capcom equates these figures to "a variety of measures including ongoing free updates and the launch of a PC version, as well as with the release of a set that includes Sunbreak."

They have since shared a compilation of the incredible inclusions from Naughty Dog, many of which can be easily missed on your average playthrough. I am talking about things like Joel's buttons being embossed with the words "Naughty Button" or being able to spot Tess' bite before she reveals her infection.

The stunt in question comes from the 1971 film Diamonds are Forever, where Sean Connery's Bond tips his vehicle onto two wheels to get through a tight gap (something those in pursuit are, of course, unable to pull off). 
"We actually prototyped doing that [during A Thief's End's jeep chase]," Uncharted 4's co-lead designer Kurt Margenau reflected during a recent chat with Couch Soup. However, as those who have played the game will know, this idea did not ultimately make the final cut.
