        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today brings the first trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's, the upcoming movie based on the enormously-popular horror game series of the same name. 


This trailer first leaked online earlier in the month - though legal notices and a fairly successful community boycott stemmed its spread.  


Here we get our first look at The Hunger Games' Josh Hutcherson, cast as a new security guard for creepy pizza chain Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. An evil-looking Matthew Lillard (Scream, Scooby-Doo) can also be seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has not appealed the Austrian loot box verdict which ordered it to refund a number of Austrian FIFA players, after a court ruled that FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) packs constituted a form of gambling.

Earlier this year, a court in Hermagor ruled that the football game's FUT packs violated the country's gambling laws. At this time, lawyer Ulrich Salburg stated the plaintiffs - which included one minor - had allegedly "gambled away" hundreds of euros on FUT packs when the uncertain monetary value of the packs purportedly violated the Austrian Gaming Act.


Consequently, the court alleged that the controversial loot boxes could be classified as "illegal gambling".

Accessible via the Dead Space remake's Steam page, the new 90-minute trial version requires players to first install the full game then hit the "play now" button to begin their free trial period, whereupon a timer will keep track of the minutes still remaining.


There doesn't appear to be a progression cap on the trial, meaning players are free to continue as far as they can before their hour and a half expires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has cancelled Overwatch 2's much-trumpeted but long-delayed PvE mode, admitting development "hasn't made the progress we would have hoped."


PvE was presented as a flagship feature of Overwatch 2 when the team-based shooter sequel was unveiled in 2019, but, as development dragged on and 2022 arrived, Blizzard announced it would be "decoupling" PvE from PvP in order to get the game into players' hands sooner.


To that end, a fully PvP-focused version of Overwatch 2 finally launched last October, and little has been heard about its once-key PvE component in the months since. Now though, in a newly aired developer livestream, Overwatch 2 executive producer Jared Neuss has confirmed the game's PvE mode is officially dead.

The news comes as part of the publisher's Financial Year 2023 earnings report, the first earnings report since its disappointing quarterly update in January, in which it announced an "increased cautiousness over the coming years" and the cancellation of three unannounced projects.


In today's end-of-year report, Ubisoft recorded net bookings of â¬1.74B, marking an 18% year-on-year decrease for the publisher, but there were some notable wins for its biggest franchises, including a record number of active users for the Assassin's Creed franchise over the last year, coming it at 44% higher than Origins and 19% higher than Odyssey.

In response, the Sega heads explained that while AAA games "have been sold at $59.99 for many years", over the last year more titles have been "sold at $69.99".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has said it's feeling "really confident" Diablo 4 will enjoy a smooth launch following a series of server stress tests.


The developer held a "Server Slam" event over the weekend to test the upcoming action role-playing game's servers one final time ahead of launch in June. The event seemed to go smoothly, with most players reporting little to no queue time and, when in-game, improved performance compared to that seen in previous tests.


Speaking to Eurogamer in an interview in London today, Diablo 4 art director John Mueller and associate game director Joe Piepiora said Blizzard is feeling good about the launch because it had learned so much from the various tests.

CMA bosses Marcus Bokkerink and Sarah Cardell faced repeated questions from the UK government's Business and Trade Committee this morning relating to the decision, just a day after the European Commission voted to approve the deal in the EU.


MPs asked the CMA to explain why it had reached a different decision on the deal to its European counterpart, and repeatedly questioned whether the CMA had considered the effects of blocking a deal like this on the UK's international reputation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shipment from Modern Warfare is one of Call of Duty's most famous maps. So famous, it actually got a revamp for the likes of Vanguard and Modern Warfare 2 (where it was set on a ship).


Its somewhat simple design, which sees a collection of vacant containers for players to shoot their way around, is a mainstay of the series. However, the original map nearly didn't make its way into Call of Duty at all. As hard as it is to imagine now, Shipment's inclusion in 2007's Modern Warfare was "truly an accident".


Speaking to Dexerto, Infinity Ward multiplayer design director Geoff Smith shared more backstory on Shipment's genesis.

The blank, unblinking eyes, the polished sheen of his mask's surface - it all leads to Link looking like a serial killer. (And considering what some of you are doing to those poor Koroks, perhaps this isn't too far off.)


This is, of course, Link's design from the recent Nintendo Switch remake of classic Game Boy adventure The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. Except there, it was part of the game's cute toy diarama aesthetic. In Tears of the Kingdom, Link's longer body and glassy-eyed expression give off a very different vibe.

The game - currently a PlayStation console exclusive - has now received a new Xbox rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). 


As spotted by Twitter user @MACOS380, Stray has been rated as E for Everyone 10+, with the ESRB noting the game features animated blood and fantasy violence. "Players sometimes encounter parasitic blobs/mice-like bots that can attack and kill the cat. Players can access a UV light to defeat the mice-like bots, causing them to explode and emit splashes of coloured liquid," the rating summary explains.

With Kubernetes 1.27, we (SIG Auth) are moving Key Management Service (KMS) v2 API to beta.
What is KMS?
One of the first things to consider when securing a Kubernetes cluster is encrypting etcd data at
rest. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to
perform this encryption.
KMS v1 has been a feature of Kubernetes since version 1.10, and is currently in beta as of version
v1.12. KMS v2 was introduced as alpha in v1.25.

the previous blog post

old versions with the alpha feature enabled will result in data loss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a good long while since we first laid eyes on dreamy Ecuadorian football adventure Despelote, but now, after several years away from the spotlight, it's resurfaced with a publisher and a planned 2024 release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.


Created by JuliÃ¡n Cordero and Sebastian Valbuena, Despelote is described as a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life adventure about "childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001". It's set during a period when the country's football team was on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time, helping instil a sense of hope in a population still reeling from a major financial crisis. 


That translates to "bittersweet and sometimes dreamy" game of kick-abouts and conversations, in which sees players - viewing the world through the eyes and ears of eight-year-old JuliÃ¡n - explore a dense corner of Quito, "full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five years after free-to-play multiplayer mech shooter Hawken was pulled offline following a tumultuous development, the brand is being revived by 505 Games as the PvE-focused, and initially single-player, Hawken Reborn.


The original Hawken burst onto the scene back in 2011 with an eye-catching work-in-progress trailer, but it struggled to find an audience once out in the real world. A failed early access attempt in 2014 saw development stall until a "relaunch" in 2017, but even that wasn't enough to get bums in mechs, and the game's PC servers were yanked for good the following year.


Which does make Hawken something of an odd choice for a revival, but here we are, five years later, with the free-to-play Hawken Reborn now listed on Steam and poised to launch into early access as a "genuinely early-in-development" title this Wednesday, 17th May.

Bloodhunt was announced toward the end of 2020 and, following a limited Steam early access release, recieved its full launch on PlayStation and PC last April. It offered players a vampiric spin on the well-worn battle royale formula, setting them loose across the rain-soaked, moon-drenched streets and rooftops of Prague, armed with supernatural parkour abilities and other clan-specific powers - plus, rather more boringly, guns.


It made for an interesting twist on a familiar genre - even if Eurogamer's Robert Purchese didn't much like the whole shooty thing when he played it back in early access - but that clearly wasn't enough to attact and retain the kind of player base Bloodhunt needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Molasses Flood, the CD-Projekt-owned studio currently working on The Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, has been hit by layoffs following the game's recent reboot.


Development on Project Sirius - previously described as a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience - was confirmed to have stalled back in March, after CD Projekt re-evaluated the "scope and commercial potential of the original concept". At the time, the company told investors it was "formulating a new framework" for the game that was better "aligned with [its] strategy".


Last week, CD Projekt shared an update on Project Sirius, announcing its "work on defining a new framework" was now complete. But that news was followed by growing reports of layoffs at the Boston-based The Molasses Flood, which was acquired by CD Projekt in 2021, with the studio's technical narrative designer Robert Bailey, environment artist Eleanore Falck, senior environment artist and world builder Gannon Jasper, and art producer Caryn M. Boehm, all revealing they had lost their jobs in tweets shared since last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having left us a vague "June" launch window for its Layers of Fear remake over the last few months, developer Bloober Team is finally ready to talk specifics, confirming its "psychedelic horror chronicle" will be releasing for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 15th June.


Layers of Fear is a bit of an unusual proposition, taking Bloober Team's two previous Layers of Fear titles (as well as the first game's Inheritance DLC), then reimagining it all as a single, interlinking narrative, featuring striking Unreal Engine 5 visuals, new gameplay elements - including a lantern to ward off shadowy terrors - and expanded plot lines.


This time around, the familiar unravellings of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece and a legendary actor making one final movie on a labyrinthine ocean liner - as featured in Layers of Fear 1 and 2 respectively - are accompanied by a new "story chapter" following the painter's rarely seen wife, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer, tying the whole thing together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon has announced fresh plans to adapt The Lord of the Rings into a new MMO "adventure", developed in-house by the studio behind New World, for PC and consoles.


The project will feature "the beloved stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings", adapted from Tolkien's original books, as licensed by rights owner Embracer. (Don't expect this to tie-in specifically with the Peter Jackson movie trilogy, or even Amazon's own Rings of Power show, set a thousand years before.)


"Bringing players a fresh take on The Lord of the Rings has long been an aspiration for our team, and we're honoured and grateful that Middle-earth Enterprises is entrusting us with this iconic world," Amazon Games boss Christoph Harmann said. "We're also pleased to be expanding our relationship with Embracer Group following our Tomb Raider deal last year, as they've proven to be excellent collaborators."

According to 3D artist Thomas of Twitter account Stylized Station, there is a lot involved to get it just right. It takes "a ton of smoke and mirrors in the background, without anyone ever realising it," they explained in a very thorough Twitter thread, noting "creating real-time simulated water is still really hard to do".


Thomas stated that most developers use a variety of "cheats" and techniques that see things such as textures, VFX sprites, normal maps, and basic geometry "smashed together" in order to give the "illusion of flowing water".

The European Commission had been one of three major regulators standing in the way of the deal, alongside the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - the latter of which dramatically blocked the deal last month, dealing a sizable blow to it succeeding overall. Microsoft is now set to appeal that decision.


In Brussels, however, it's better news for Microsoft - after a couple of concessions ended up winning over EU regulators.

Link is also making his merry way through Hyrule's many regions and camps in a range of eclectic creations, from mechs to trucks and tanks.


As a reminder, Link's new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects, and with a bit of creativity players can conjure up their own vehicles and such to beetle across Hyrule. 


While I have been happy enough to just place a fan on the back of my timber board to make it go, others clearly have a much better imagination (and a lot more patience, I won't lie, I am still finding Ultrahand quite fiddly to get the hang of) than I do. As a result, there have been some truly remarkable Ultrahand designs making the rounds online.

As with its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, Link can search the lands of Hyrule to find these woodland spirits, and return the seeds to Hestu. As in Breath of the Wild, Hestu will then add these seeds to his prized maracas, do a little shimmy, and grant you a new weapon slot. It's all very wholesome. 


Or, at least it was in Breath of the Wild. However, Tears of the Kingdom has upped the ante when it comes to Korok puzzles. This time around, Link often has to reunite two separated Korok companions. This sounds innocent enough - who doesn't want to see two long lost friends reunited? Well, apparently many Tears of the Kingdom players, that's who. 


Thanks to the sequel's new Ultrahand ability, which allows Link to pick up, move, and rotate objects (including Koroks), many players out there have taken to fusing these poor blighters to homemade crucifixes, rockets and even spit roasting the innocent spirits.

Aonuma agreed Ocarina of Time did create a format but it was ultimately restrictive for the designers, while Breath of the Wild offered a new type of play.

How can Pod start-up be accelerated on nodes in large clusters? This is a common issue that
cluster administrators may face.
This blog post focuses on methods to speed up pod start-up from the kubelet side. It does not
involve the creation time of pods by controller-manager through kube-apiserver, nor does it
include scheduling time for pods or webhooks executed on it.
We have mentioned some important factors here to consider from the kubelet's perspective, but
this is not an exhaustive list. As Kubernetes v1.27 is released, this blog highlights
significant changes in v1.27 that aid in speeding up pod start-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the biggest boxed video game launch of the year so far in the UK.

According to our sister site GamesIndustry.biz, that makes it the series' biggest ever launch week in the UK, surpassing the launches of even early games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time which were only available physically at the time. 

According to GI and the GfK charts, Tears of the Kingdom's instant pole position pushes Hogwarts Legacy from its top spot, and moves Star Wars Jedi: Survivor into third place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metacritic has finally opened The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom open to user reviews, and over three hundred players have left mixed or negative feedback.

Although The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now the highest-rated game of the year thus far on Metacritic - and the highest-rated game of all time on OpenCritic â and industry analysts are opining that Nintendo's all-new adventure will impact the charts not just for the next few months, but "years", some fans are making their disappointment more than clear, and whilst the critic score sits at a lofty 96, the user score aggregated from over 1600 reviewers is 8.5.

Yes, admittedly, some people are devastated that you cannot pet the dog, but that doesn't account for the hundreds of reviews that cite the sequel hasn't address the purported issues of its predecessor, calls the gameplay "boring", or reports ongoing performance issues.

Developer Soda Den took to social media over the weekend to claim that the game was removed "without [its] knowledge or consent" following "issues" with publisher Crytivo.

"As you may have noticed, the Roots of Pache Steam page is temporarily offline," the statement begins. "We are sad to report that we have been engaged in a dispute with Crytivo over the rights to Roots of Pacha. We worked hard to amicably resolve our issue with Crytivo internally. Instead of working with us to address the issue, Crytivo went to Valve and authorised them to remove Roots of Pacha from Steam without our knowledge or consent.

That's according to industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who took to Twitter to reflect on Tears of the Kingdom's legacy both in relation to its predecessor Breath of the Wild, and the charts more generally. 

"Sometimes I wonder if a game can last a few months on the top 20 best-seller charts," he tweeted ahead of the game's release earlier this week.

Epic Games stopped short of confirming it outright, of course, but instead dropped a mysterious tweet and a 20-second video teaser that declares that "a new way to grab the Victory Royale is coming", inviting you to "rise through the ranks".

The real clue, however, is in that accompanying video; whilst short, it seems to take us through eight different ranks, seemingly starting at bronze and progressing through silver, gold and more until it goes all the way toâ¦ I don't know, super-duper-platinum or something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA is dabbling in a spot of democracy by throwing caution to the wind and letting The Sims 4 players decide what they want to see in some upcoming DLC.


Perhaps thankfully (I say this as someone who spends a lot of time on The Sims 4 subreddits), this isn't a free-for-all, and voters must operate within some extremely rigid parameters.


EA is specifically canvassing players to decide on the themes of two upcoming Kit packs, one focused around Create-a-Sim fashion and the other around building.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steve Gaynor, the controversial co-founder of Gone Home and Tacoma developer Fullbright, is now going it alone under the Fullbright name following accusations of toxic workplace behaviour in August 2021.


Gaynor made headlines at the time after an exodus of 15 staff at Fullbright was, in part, blamed on his behaviour towards fellow workers. An investigation by Polygon claimed Gaynor was "controlling", and that staff, particularly women, frequently felt "undermined and demeaned", disparaged and discredited.


Soon after, Gaynor publicly acknowledged his "leadership style was hurtful to people that worked at Fullbright", and announced he would be stepping back from the day-to-day development of the studio's latest game, Open Roads. A separate statement from Fullbright confirmed Gaynor would also be vacating his role as the studio's creative lead and manager.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Frictional Games has announced another short delay for its intriguing "unscripted" WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker, but it's also releasing a little something to tide fans over between now and its new 6th June arrival date in the form of a demo soon coming to Steam.


Amnesia: The Bunker - the fourth game in the Amnesia series, following on from The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, and Rebirth - has seen a number of delays this year as Frictional puts the finishing touches to the experience, and the developer has now made the decision to push its release back another two weeks, from 23rd May to 6th June.


In a short statement announcing the news, Frictional attributed the latest delay to "unforeseen certification issues". The decision, it said, was "crucial to ensure we do not ship the game with these issues", adding the extra time afforded by the delay will allow it to "rectify the problem and ensure the best possible gameplay experience on release".

An eye-catching run from YouTuber gymnast86, posted this morning, shows the game beaten in just 94 minutes. This is an any% speedrun with no assists from amiibo.


What's interesting here is nearly half of the run covers the game's opening portion without any major shortcuts. Even with knowledge of where to go and how to do it, this takes over 40 minutes.

<blockquote><p>The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term âA.I.â If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as âcapitalâs willing executionersâ? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make peopleâs lives worse? Suppose you&#8217;ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. thatâs entirely obedient to humansÂ­&#8212;one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn&#8217;t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you weren't aware, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released today. Along with the sequel's new-look Hyrule, Link also has a range of new abilities that can help him on his journey to once again rid the kingdom of the many evils that have made their home there. 


One such ability is Ascend, which allows Link to pass through solid objects above him. This is a game changer when it comes to traversal, as Link no longer has to necessarily negotiate the weather and his stamina to make his way up cliffs and the like. Now, he can find some kind of overhang and pop up and through to create seemingly impossible shortcuts. 


However, this useful new ability wasn't always going to make it into Tears of the Kingdom's final release. In fact, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma and game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi revealed it actually started off as a debug cheat function not intended for the game.

The ocean moon of Saturn was cruelly cut from Destiny 2 alongside several other destinations back in 2020, as developer Bungie sought to trim the amount of content it had to keep up to date. It was an unpopular decision, and one it has now ceased.


Some of that content has since been re-added, with Titan looking set to make a reappearance in the upcoming Season of the Deep. Here's a quick teaser:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My copy of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is currently "out for delivery", and expected to arrive sometime this afternoon. It is now afternoon, and there's still no sign of it. To save myself from twiddling my thumbs while staring mindlessly at the wall, I decided to check out Flappy Souls.

Flappy Souls is a new, free release on Steam. It is marketed as being "a mix of Flappy Bird and Dark Souls", hence the name. The premise is remarkably simple - you have to fly around as a baseball cap-wearing bird while dodging obstacles. Smattered through these obstacles are souls that you have to collect, and as you progress you level up. And that's it. Easy, right? No, not right. This game is HARD! 


Now, before I get too into it, let me ask - are you the kind of person who ducks a little when you go under a low bridge in a car? I am. For some reason, I have it hardwired into my brain that physically ducking will somehow ensure safer passage. Logically, of course, I know it makes absolutely no sense. If my car isn't going to fit, me ducking, or breathing in when I pass another vehicle on a slightly narrower stretch of road, isn't going to change that. And yet, I still do it.

This eclectic menagerie of characters all come from Tenacious D's latest music video, for a song aptly named "Video Games". Animated versions of Black and Kyle Gass begin the promo in a fairly normal way. The duo are in a studio, with Black singing into his mic while Gass strums on his animated guitar. Soon, however, things become chaoticly brilliant.


It starts with Gass getting squashed by God of War's DauÃ°i KaupmaÃ°r, and Black fleeing the scene only to find himself in the middle of Fallout 4 (as one does). The rest of the video then sees the duo becoming Sonic and Tails, Red Dead cowboys and more. As I have said, it is brilliant, as you can see for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It may be Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launch day, but Nintendo is already thinking about the future - and the possibility of a Legend of Zelda game where Zelda could finally be the star.


Fans have long called for Zelda to take on more of an active role in the series she gives her name to. And more recently, Zelda has indeed been playable in spin-offs such as Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Age of Calamity.


But the main Zelda series has remained steadfast at always casting Link as the hero, and Zelda herself as someone kept largely off-screen. (And that's all we'll say here, where there shall be no Tears of the Kingdom spoilers.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Call of Duty is Modern Warfare 3 and is due out 10th November on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, according to a report by Insider Gaming.


The game is pitched as a "fully-fledged sequel" to last year's Modern Warfare 2, with development led by Vanguard maker Sledgehammer Games and support provided by Activision's many Call of Duty studios.


Apparently all the modes you'd expect from a full-blown Call of Duty game are included, such as campaign, multiplayer and zombies ("essentially an Outbreak 2.0" that may or may not be free-to-play). There's a new Warzone 2 map planned for later in the year based on the Las Almas map from the Modern Warfare 2 campaign.

The showrunners were making casting preparations for The Last of Us' second season up until earlier this week, when it was put on hold, Variety reports.


According to sources familiar with the matter, up until this point the casting team had been asking actors to read sides taken "directly" from The Last of Us Part 2, PlayStation's 2020 release that the second season will be based on, during auditions, as there are currently no scripts for the show itself.

As for the potential of a price rise - as Sony did for PlayStation 5 last summer - Nintendo did not entirely rule it out.

If you have deployed Kubernetes pods with CPU and/or memory resources
specified, you may have noticed that changing the resource values involves
restarting the pod. This has been a disruptive operation for running
workloads... until now.
In Kubernetes v1.27, we have added a new alpha feature that allows users
to resize CPU/memory resources allocated to pods without restarting the
containers. To facilitate this, the resources field in a pod's containers
now allow mutation for cpu and memory resources. They can be changed
simply by patching the running pod spec.
This also means that resources field in the pod spec can no longer be
relied upon as an indicator of the pod's actual resources. Monitoring tools
and other such applications must now look at nâ¦]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In anticipation of its June arrival on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC, Bloober Team's Layers of Fear remake is getting a "short" playable demo on Steam next Monday, 15th May.


Bloober's updated version of Layers of Fear, which was initially announced under the name Layers of Fears, is being co-developed with Anshar Studios. It sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 all rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 and reimagined as a single, generations-spanning "psychedelic horror chronicle".


Both previously released games - which respectively chart the gradual unravellings of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece and a legendary actor making one final movie on a labyrinthine ocean liner - get some striking new visuals in the reboot, alongside new gameplay and expanded plot lines. And there's a new framing device tying the whole lot together, focusing on a new lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer.

Project Sirius - a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience being developed by The Flame and the Flood studio Molasses Flood - was announced last October as part of CD Projekt's ambitious studio roadmap, which included a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, a new IP, the next Witcher trilogy, and a remake of the first Witcher game.


However, March brought the news work on Project Sirius had stalled after CD Projekt had re-evaluated the "scope and commercial potential of the original concept". At the time, the company told investors it was in the process of "formulating a new framework" for the game that was better "aligned with [its] strategy".

Summer Game Fest officially begins on 8th June with a live showcase promising a mix of premieres, gameplay demos, and announcements, but it'll continue on well after that, with various other industry events and showcases - including those previously announced by Xbox and Ubisoft - set to fall under the Summer Game Fest banner throughout the season.


That's about as much detail as we'd heard previously, but the official Summer Game Fest Twitter account has now revealed a sizeable list of game companies confirmed to be taking part in some capacity, including big names like PlayStation, Xbox, Capcom, Sega, CD Projekt, Bandai Namco, EA, Epic Games, Netflix, Activision, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Warner Bros.

We first caught a glimpse of the ROG Ally on 1st April this year, but Asus was quick to confirm the device was not, in fact, a weirdly elaborate April Fool's Day prank, but rather an actual real thing it was planning to release.


A few weeks later, Asus was ready to talk specs, confirming the ROG Ally would include an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor, a seven-inch 1080p 120Hz touch screen, a UHS-2 Micro SD card slot, plus Windows 11 support, and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It also promised "up to" 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM in dual-channel mode and storage of "up to" 512GB PCIe 4.0 SSD, although it offered little word on other planned configurations.

Announced back in 2020, Goodbye Volcano High - which follows the adventures of a group of teen dinosaurs as they learn to live and love in a world teetering on the bring of destruction - was originally expected to launch in 2021, but a narrative reboot and the global pandemic saw KO_OP shift its release into 2023.


Earlier this year, it seemed an end was finally in sight when KO_OP slapped it with a 15th June release date, but the studio has now opted to push the game's launch back by another ten weeks "after assessing its production schedule".

In a video posted to his YouTube channel, embedded below, Cain revealed the idea behind the vaults and their various dastardly experiments was to help scientists figure out how humans might survive interstellar travel - an idea he conveived after Fallout 1 came out in 1997.


Deciding there would be "no earth to come back to" in the event of a nuclear war, the head of the Enclave and the US government hatched a plan to build a starship that would take "our best and brightest" to a distant solar system in the hope of colonising a suitable planet.

In it, Nintendo asks respondees to rate their knowledge of the Pikmin series so far (fairly strong), their impressions of Pikmin 4's recent marketing (it's been OK), and what they'd be keen to hear more about as its 21st July release date nears.


This last part is most interesting to me, as it touches on a few features Nintendo has only hinted at so far. This includes "delving into puzzle-filled caves, and carefully managing your resources until you escape" plus "embarking on night-time missions that feature new and intense gameplay".

"While playing it safe and a tad predictable, Tequila Works carefully layers on new gimmicks and mechanics as you progress through Gylt, allowing you to organically build on your knowledge and start experimenting," Vikki wrote in Eurogamer's Gylt review.

The image emerged yesterday on the @BKTOOR4 Twitter account, apparently from a datamine. It didn't take long for Activision to haul the tweet offline, but of course the internet noticed.


According to Charlie Intel, this new Resurgence map is called Vondel and is set in The Netherlands, which should make for a welcome palette-cleanser following the sandy Al Mazrah map and the current Ashika Island Resurgence map.

This comic was announced last week, along with the standalone PlayStation 5 version of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. After a brief time of being available in US comic book stores, the entire thing is now online for free. 


I have had a read of the comic myself, and it is a nice, pretty condensed, standalone story that should help fill some of the void between now and Marvel's Spider-Man 2's eventual debut (don't worry, I am not going to spoil anything here). If you are interested in having a read of what Peter Parker and co. have been getting up to ahead of Marvel's Spider-Man 2's release, you can check out the online version of the comic here.

The game will see you play as John Mouston, a private detective sniffing out corruption and rogue rodents. Inspired by rubber hose animation, John Mouston bears some resemblance to Walt Disney's beloved Mickey Mouse. Indeed, he has the long snout(is that correct terminology?) with a round nose, the big ears and the white gloves. But he also has a revolver and cigars, so he's definitely not Mickey Mouse.


The gameplay we've seen so far gives me Doom vibes, whilst the vending machines remind me a lot of BioShock. I'd be lying if I said it doesn't look fun to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bella Ramsey, perhaps best known on this site for playing Ellie in HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, has briefly hung up her shivs and bricks to take Gran Turismo 7 for a test drive. 


Ramsey, who has previously spoken about her repeated attempts to get a driving licence, is now promoting Sony's racing sim on the PSVR2. "I am about to take my fifth driving test," the actor begins, before admitting she is a bit nervous about the whole ordeal. It should all be ok, right? Because, after all, Ramsey has a nice PSVR2 set and Gran Turismo 7, so she'll get plenty of practice.


Cut to Ramsey tearing her way round Gran Turismo 7's race tracks in her new VR wheels, with an appropriate amount of whooping and mock road rage. But alas, these new found tactics and moves do not work in the real world, and Ramsey does not pass her driving test. "You were doing 80 in a 30," her driving instructor explains. It's a really fun advert, so do check it out for yourself below.

In Kubernetes, a Service can be used to provide a unified traffic endpoint for
applications running on a set of Pods. Clients can use the virtual IP address (or VIP) provided
by the Service for access, and Kubernetes provides load balancing for traffic accessing
different back-end Pods, but a ClusterIP type of Service is limited to providing access to
nodes within the cluster, while traffic from outside the cluster cannot be routed.
One way to solve this problem is to use a type: NodePort Service, which sets up a mapping
to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, thus redirecting traffic from the
outside to the inside of the cluster.
How Kubernetes allocates node ports to Services?
When a type: NodePort Service is created, its corresponding port(s) are alâ¦]]></summary>

NetherRealm shared a first teaser at the start of this month, appended to a video celebrating Mortal Kombat's 30th anniversary. It showed sands steadily trickling through an hourglass before a sudden camera zoom focused in on the very last grain, which then exploded.


It's now been four years since the launch of Mortal Kombat 11, and news-starved fans immediately began speculating NetherRealm's mysterious video was in some way teasing an imminent reveal for Mortal Kombat 12 - with one theory suggesting Kronika's time-and-space-altering hourglass, which featured prominently in the previous game, may have gone awry, somehow resetting the universe.

First revealed back in 2020, Dordogne casts players as 32-year-old Mimi who, at the start of the game, returns to the home of her recently deceased grandmother in the titular French province, where she begins to reflect on the summers of her youth.


From there, the adventure splits across two timelines; in one, present-day Mimi explores her grandmother's home, rifling through souvenirs and solving puzzles, while ten-year-old Mimi faces her own challenges, from forest walks and climbing to kayaking and cave explorations.

Dungeons! Mitherflipping dungeons are returning in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom!


More specifically - according to Nintendo's Hidemaro Fujibayashi, speaking in a new Ask the Developer interview - "huge", "traditional" dungeons are making their return to the Legend of Zelda series in Tears of the Kingdom after their conspicuous absence in Breath of the Wild.


Tears of the Kingdom's predecessor saw Nintendo shake up the traditional Zelda formula in a big way, not just in its sprawling open-world, but by replacing lengthy, elaborate dungeons - which have been part of the Zelda series since its inception in 1986 - with micro-dungeon-like Shrines and more expansive, although largely forgettable, Divine Beasts.

According to Reuters, the regulator is set to approve the deal sometime next week. Sources familiar with the matter said 15th May (next Monday) is the likeliest date for this, however the EC's own deadline for its decision on Microsoft's proposed deal is still set for 22nd May.


The regulator had previously announced a provisional deadline of 25th April for its decision on the potential takeover, but that date shifted to May after Microsoft submitted remedies in its efforts to gain approval from regulatory bodies.

In short, Eurogamer is moving to a five-star review rating system, beginning this week.  


For years now, I've felt our existing review badges weren't working hard enough for us, or for you. We ended up recommending a lot of games, or not giving a badge at all to many others - which meant readers not acquainted with our odd four-point scale had nothing to go on. We rarely used Avoid, because it always felt a bit mean.

Asobo Studio's well-received rat-infested sequel also now has enhanced graphics for PC, with a Nintendo Switch cloud version due out next week. Meanwhile, all platforms get several bug fixes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has added a rather unique warning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor players who try to bypass its story elements. 


Many out there enjoy the challenge of exploiting games in such a way that will allow them to progress through a story quicker. Speedrunning communities exist to share tricks and glitches that sometimes see entire areas skipped - because someone managed to crouch next to that one specific bit of wall while holding that one specific sword in their left hand (or something like that).


EA is clearly aware of this, and has implemented an in-game message that triggers if a player reaches an area that should be, in theory, unreachable at that point in the game. Should this happen, a warning will pop up on the player's screen stating "an unexpected error" has occurred.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released a new advert for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and on my first watch through I had my video game news reporter hat on, looking closely at the gameplay moments for fresh clues. 


My efforts didn't really bring up much new. I now know that for your Ultrahand-made raft to not topple over in the water, you need to make sure it is balanced by some support logs on either side. But that really is about it in terms of gameplay analysis. 


Then I watched it again, and this time my mind was drawn not to Link gadabouting through the sky, but to the real life, "everyday" man the advert actually focuses on. It is quite clear what (or who) Nintendo is trying to paint a picture of here.

Team Cherry had planned to launch Silksong before July this year. Spokesperson Matthew Griffin last night admitted via Twitter that development was "still continuing" and the team wanted to "take the time to make the game as good as we can".


Another reason for the delay? Silksong has also now "gotten quite big", Griffin said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced its latest financial earning, confirming record net bookings of $1.95B for its most recent quarter - and, alas, the news that BioWare's highly anticipated Dragon Age: Dreadwolf won't be out until at least April next year.


Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which has been in some form of development since at least 2017, has never been given an official release date, but reports last year suggested BioWare was targeting a late 2023 launch for the long-awaited title.


Hopes for a 2023 release among fans remained unabated when, last October, the studio confirmed Dreadwolf had reached the alpha stage of development and was playable "to the very end" - but those hopes have now been dashed through omission, via EA's newly revealed release schedule for the current financial year.

Details of the title are limited, but the companies have shared an unexpectedly moody bit of concept art to accompany today's news, showcasing a character adorned in something like traditional Japanese garb amid a forest of towering trees.


"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work," Game Freak director Kota Furushima said in a statement. "From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise give us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future."

Dark and Darker received a hugely positive reception when it made a Steam Next Fest appearance earlier this year, but things went quickly awry.


In March, Nexon accused Ironmace of "using materials and assets they worked on during their time" at Nexon to create Dark and Darker, soon after issuing a cease and desist demand which resulted in the game's removal from Steam. This has forced the developer to get creative as it continues to release new playtest builds to players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie's winning streak against Destiny 2 cheat sellers continues with the news it's now been awarded $6.7m USD in damages following a ruling in its lawsuit against LaviCheats.


Bungie filed its claim against LaviCheats owner Kunal Bansal back in 2021, alongside lawsuits against two other cheat sellers: Elite Tech Boss and VeteranCheats. Elite Boss Tech agreed to settle last July, paying $13.5m in damages, and a court ruled against VeteranCheats earlier this month, ordering it to pay Bungie $12m USD in damages.


That just left the developer's case against LaviCheats and (as spotted by TorrentFreak) a federal court in Washington has now issued a default judgment against the India-based Bansal - as requested in a motion filed by Bungie earlier this year - after he failed to appear in court.

The CMA recently made the shock decision to block Microsoft's $68.7bn acquisition of Activision following its months-long investigation, citing concerns over the deal's impact on the cloud gaming sector, which it said risked "stifling competition in this growing market".


In response, Microsoft announced it would be appealing the CMA's decision, while Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick told staff the move would "stifle investment, competition, and job creation throughout the UK gaming industry", insisting "it is far from the final word on this deal".

The Roze and Thorn bundle includes the Thorns Out Roze operator skin. This skin spawns players with a free UAV bonus effect for the popular extraction mode, DMZ.


In Call of Duty, a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) reveals enemy locations on the mini-map for 30 seconds - a particularly useful ability in a game that involves player versus environment versus player elements. The effect is potentially pronounced in squad play, where up to six can team up.

In its recent financial report, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed The Last of Us is now averaging nearly 32 million cross-platform viewers per episode in the States. 


In addition to this, the company stated The Last of Us is the "most-watched show in the history of HBO Max in both Europe and Latin America". This data is all based on figures from market measurement firm Nielsen, as well as first-party data.

That's according to GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring, who revealed Jedi: Survivor's digital downloads accounted for almost double the amount Fallen Order managed.


Dring noted that even though Survivor's physical sales were down on Fallen Order's, overall sales were markedly up from EA's 2019 release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, following in the footsteps of the Fallout games, has cheesy post-sex pillow talk.


Confirmation comes from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which in its Starfield rating summary spilled the beans that Bethesda's next game not only lets players have sex, but splutter lines of dialogue after the deed.


This "suggestive material", as the ESRB puts it, includes moral panic-inducing lines such as "Life is a sexually transmitted disease that's a hundred percent fatal"; "I'm all for getting a little wild, but next time let's try it without the jetpacks"; and "Talk about seeing stars, whew... that was amazing".

Nintendo painted a mixed picture in its latest financial results, with hardware sales now definitively past the console's peak as the Switch enters its seventh year of life. 


That said, game sales remain strong - down only slightly on the console's last two years in terms of first-party software like PokÃ©mon and Splatoon, and still well up on 2020 and everything before that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of anticipation, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's release is now only a few days away. In order to make sure everyone is up to speed on what happened across Hyrule ahead of the sequel's debut, Nintendo has released a video recapping Breath of the Wild's story.


If you have a spare six-and-a-bit minutes, this video is a nice digestible way to relive the game's plot. After all, Breath of the Wild did release six years ago, so a little refresher perhaps wouldn't go amiss.  


As you would expect, Nintendo's video covers everything from the four champions, some of the various enemies that Ganon has doing his bidding, and Zelda helping Link out in Breath of the Wild's final confrontation. But that's enough from me. Go and make yourself a quick brew and have a watch of Nintendo's Breath of the Wild recap for yourself below.

Hi-Fi Rush players will be familiar with Chai's couch, on which he can snuggle robot cat 808, have a snooze or have a little chat with himself as he decompresses from the action-packed missions.

This week sees the arrival of the game's fourth patch, which addresses a variety of issues, both platform specific and across all versions of the game. 


With this patch in play, PC users can expect to see updated occlusion behaviour for raytracing, which will reduce idle time stalls. EA has also updated its PC streaming budgets, something the developer says will help alleviate traversal hitching. The team has also implemented general performance improvements for "some VFX" (this update will also be coming "soon" to console versions of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor). Lastly on the PC specific updates (for today, at least), EA has updated the data handling when toggling raytracing, improving non-raytraced performance.

Declarative configuration management with the kubectl apply command is the gold standard approach
to creating or modifying Kubernetes resources. However, one challenge it presents is the deletion
of resources that are no longer needed. In Kubernetes version 1.5, the --prune flag was
introduced to address this issue, allowing kubectl apply to automatically clean up previously
applied resources removed from the current configuration.
Unfortunately, that existing implementation of --prune has design flaws that diminish its
performance and can result in unexpected behaviors. The main issue stems from the lack of explicit

More specifically, Dinosaur Polo Club is marking ten years since the studio first hit upon the idea for Mini Metro during a Ludum Dare Game Jam, creating an early iteration of the game that would go on to make a major splash the following year.


Since then we've seen a successor in 2019's majestic Mini Motorways, and Dinosaur Polo Club is now preparing the mother of all crossovers, announcing it'll be bringing three Mini Metro maps into Mini Motorways, with three maps also going the other way in its big July update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author: Xing Yang (VMware)
Volume group snapshot is introduced as an Alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.27.
This feature introduces a Kubernetes API that allows users to take crash consistent
snapshots for multiple volumes together. It uses a label selector to group multiple
PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting.
This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers.
An overview of volume group snapshots
Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of
multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents âcopiesâ from multiple volumes that
are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate
new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to
a previous state (represented by the snapshots).

According to Axios and a recent court filing, 1548 women have received a payment of between $2500 and $5000 (Â£1977 - Â£3950) at Riot, whilst hundreds of Activision employees are also receiving payouts for a separate, but similar, settlement.

Last Year â which was originally developed by Elastic Games and "amassed a passionate player base and hundreds of thousands of downloads since it first launched as a Discord exclusive in 2018" â has been "reborn" by new developer Undaunted Games and returned to Steam as a free-to-play title.

"We've always believed in the potential of this title," says Undaunted Games studio head and producer, Matthew Itovitch. "When we did the marketing for the game at PAX East and West in 2018, we saw the reactions from players, and also what this game could be. Last Year definitely deserves another shot at realising that, and bringing back the game is the first step."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has confirmed that Destiny 2's in-game message that announced Warlocks had won an event that hadn't yet finished was "erroneous".

Destiny 2's annual Guardian Games month-long event kicked off earlier this week, ushering in a little more "friendly competition" between the three classes, Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks. So it came as quite a surprise when Bungie deployed an in-game message to all players that declared Warlocks had won.

"Warlocks won Guardian Games 2023!" the message stated. "Warlocks win! Warlocks earned the most medallions and won this year's Games! Visit the Tower for the Closing Ceremony."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amnesia: The Bunker, the new "unscripted" WW1 horror from SOMA developer Frictional Games, is almost upon us following a number of delays, and with its 23rd May release date looming, the studio has shared 10 new minutes of gameplay to ponder.


The Bunker, for a bit of context, is the fourth game in Frictional's Amnesia series, which began with 2010's acclaimed The Dark Descent. Since then we've seen a Chinese-Room-developed successor in 2013's A Machine for Pigs, and Frictional returned to the series in 2021 with its ambitious Amnesia: Rebirth, set in the Algerian desert. 


Frictional's latest, Amnesia: The Bunker, marks a notable departure for the series, trading traditionally linear tales of horror for "unscripted" scares in a nightmarish semi-open-world as players - in the role of French solider Henri ClÃ©ment - attempt to flee a relentless, "adaptive" otherworldly creature through the claustrophobic confines of the titular subterranean space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia, the acclaimed - and previously Epic Games Store exclusive - survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is making its way to Steam with a first-person mode and other new features later this year.


Saturnalia originally released last October, taking players on a journey through the ancient, ever-shifting town of the title in adventure heavily inspired by Sardinia folklore.


The gist is players - switching between four different characters at will - must explore, avoid the things in the shadows, and solve the mystery of Saturnalia in order to earn their freedom. Only, should all four characters die, the town will reassert itself, reconfiguring its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

Based in San Mateo, California, PixelOpus was established with the express purpose of giving young developers a start in the industry, and was formally announced as a new internal Sony studio in 2014. It would go on to release its first game, the striking Entwined, that same year.


While PixelOpus' initial outing received a mixed critical reception, its follow-up title, Concrete Genie, fared much better in 2019. It was nominated for a BAFTA Artistic Achievement award, and Eurogamer called it a "small, perfectly formed adventure" in our Recommended review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has announced a 20% price increase for Destiny 2's standalone season pass, but the studio says its all-in-one Annual Pass won't be affected by the move.


Destiny 2 first added a battle-pass-style Season Pass as part of its third year of content, back in 2019. Since then, each three-month-long Season Pass has been priced at 1,000 Silver (approximately Â£9/$10 USD depending on premium currency bundle), making this the first price bump since their introduction.


Bungie's newly announced 20% price increase - which won't affect the Lightfall standard edition season pass or Lightfall and Annual Pass edition - means each new Season Pass will now cost 1,200 Silver. Additionally, Destiny 2's Season Pass + 10 Ranks Bundle will cost 2,200 Silver instead of 2,000.

We also look beyond Redfall at the pressure now on Microsoft to deliver with Starfield, following various first-party delays and disappointments over the past few years. As Xbox takes stock of its progress this console generation, big questions remain over how it competes in the years to come - with some potentially gloomy (for Microsoft) answers. 
Joining me to share their thoughts are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the fallout from Redfall's release continues, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has raised eyebrows with his claim that Microsoft expected the game to score much better in critics' reviews. 


During a wide-ranging interview with Kinda Funny, Spencer said Xbox had planned for Redfall to land with an average review score "double digits" higher than the one it actually got.


"We do mock reviews for every game we launch, and this is double digits lower than we thought we would be with this game," Spencer said. "That's one of the disappointing things. We would never strive to launch a game that we thought was going to review in the low-60s. It's not part of our goals."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A collector has purchased one of the original Nintendo Gamecube concept consoles from Nintendo's 2000 Space World presentation.


Space World, which ran until 2001, was essentially a precursor to the digital-only Direct showcases, where Nintendo would reveal its new games and hardware. The 2000 show was infamous for revealing both the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance.


Consolevariations' Donny Fillerup was recently alerted to a strange prototype GameCube, Kotaku reported, which turned out to be one of the original machines shown at Space World 2000.

According to IGN, the Hollywood movie star is in final negotiations to play the video game movie star in the sequel to 2021's popular Mortal Kombat film.


For me, Urban is an odd pick for Johnny Cage. In the Mortal Kombat games Cage is a clean cut, quick-witted action movie star whose vanity is matched only by his star-studded smile. When I think of Karl Urban, I think of all his gruff, beardy roles, such as Judge Dredd in the wonderful Dredd movie, the superhero hating Billy Butcher, and the hairy rider of Rohan, Ãomer in The Lord of the Rings. For Cage, I'm thinking Ryan Gosling's Ken or Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool, without the suit.

Microsoft's Xbox Series X and S currently lag behind Sony's PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch, with sales struggling.


And after the disastrous launch of Redfall - something Spencer has personally apologised for - Microsoft faces increasingly tough questions over Microsoft's ability to regularly release high quality triple-A games, and the future growth of subscription service Game Pass.

So, this is your last chance to get your hands on some PS4 classics such as Bloodborne, Until Dawn, The Last of Us Remastered and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End before the collection is disbanded for good. 


The PlayStation Plus Collection was introduced back in 2020 as a curated selection of great PS4 games that PlayStation 5 owners would be able to download and play on their new generation consoles. 


However, on 9th May, the following 19 PS4 games will be removed from PS Plus, as Sony is removing the collection from its service.

Each season pass also has a free and premium track, so you have fresh goals to aim for and cosmetics to unlock whether you pay, or not. And if you start off free, you can always upgrade later to instantly get all premium rewards up to that point.


Season 1 will begin in June, with a second to follow in autumn, a third in winter and a fourth in spring 2024. Each will host 100 levels.

Kubernetes v1.27, released in April 2023, introduced changes to
Memory QoS (alpha) to improve memory management capabilites in Linux nodes.
Support for Memory QoS was initially added in Kubernetes v1.22, and later some
limitations
around the formula for calculating memory.high were identified. These limitations are
addressed in Kubernetes v1.27.
Background
Kubernetes allows you to optionally specify how much of each resources a container needs
in the Pod specification. The most common resources to specify are CPU and Memory.
For example, a Pod manifest that defines container resource requirements could look like:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: example
spec:
containers:
- name: nginx
resources:
requests:
memory: "64Mi"
cpu: "250m"
limits:
memory: "6â¦]]></summary>

Sea of Thieves' first Mystery, which ran from May to September last year, was a lovely idea in principle, weaving a web of devious clues - both in and out of the game - that would eventually reveal the culprit behind the murder of prominent character DeMarco Singh.


It certainly had its moments - the magical in-game lantern given to players at the start of the Mystery, revealing clues wherever its light shone in the world, was a lovely bit of clue-hunting paraphernalia - but, unfortunately, the whole thing just ended up lurching awkwardly to its less-than-stellar conclusion, hindered by a clumsy, immersion-shattering insistence on gating progress behind social media engagement targets.

IronOak's follow-up - which pits players against the kingdom of Fahrul's tyrannical queen 20 years after the end of the first game - is, from what's been shown so far, less a bold new direction for the series and more a deepening of the original's already hugely entertaining core.


That means another light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure blending familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - with some neat story generation through randomised narrative events.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox boss Phil Spencer has personally apologised for the failure of Arkane's Redfall, which was widely panned this week.


The triple-A first-party shooter has suffered a disastrous launch, with players and reviewers criticising everything from the blandness of its world to the many bugs, its uninspired looter shooter mechanics to performance issues. It is Arkane's worst-reviewed game, and has a "mostly negative" user review rating on Steam.


The failure of Redfall has also brought into question Microsoft's ability to launch high-quality games with any regularity after a string of high-profile flops, and has caused some to cancel their Game Pass subscription between now and the upcoming launch of Bethesda's Starfield in September.

AI is very much a topic of concern for the games industry right now. Recent releases, such as High On Life and the upcoming System Shock remake, have both used AI during development and its use has raised eyebrows among players. 
There was a mix of concerns and excitement regarding AI among developers at GDC in March, Chris Tapsell reported. Following the UK government's white paper on AI which was published in March, the CMA is now assessing potential effects of the technology on markets and consumers.

On its release, it will boast touch screen controls, but will also support "a wide array of third party gamepads" developer Young Horses says. 
Other than that, news on this upcoming release is fairly barren, but the developer has promised more details (I presume such as a firm release date rather than the broad release window we have now) in the future.

The claim, by third-party app store analytics firm AppMagic, initially reported by MobileGamer.biz, suggested PokÃ©mon Go's revenue had taken a big hit last month - to its lowest monthly total since February 2018, over five years ago.


Responding to Eurogamer today, Niantic said the estimate was wrong, and that PokÃ©mon Go's 2023 revenue to date was up on the same period in 2022.

In response to one Twitter user sharing an image of their Switch home screen, which had Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lined up and ready to play (presumably obtained by illegitimate means, but I can't say for sure), the Nintendo of America alum decided to flex his muscle by quoting from the Neeson-fronted action film Taken.


"I don't know what you want. What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you," Fils-AimÃ© wrote.

"[It] slowly turned from a company that vocally valued its writers to one where we were... quietly resented, with a reliance on expensive narrative seen as the 'albatross' holding the company back," Gaider wrote.

Kubernetes v1.27 graduated to beta a new policy mechanism for
StatefulSets that controls the lifetime of
their PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). The new PVC
retention policy lets users specify if the PVCs generated from the StatefulSet spec template should
be automatically deleted or retrained when the StatefulSet is deleted or replicas in the StatefulSet
are scaled down.
What problem does this solve?
A StatefulSet spec can include Pod and PVC templates. When a replica is first created, the
Kubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist. The behavior
before the PVC retention policy was that the control plane never cleaned up the PVCs created for
StatefulSets - this was left up to the cluster administrator, or to some add-on â¦]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has secured another legal win against a Destiny 2 cheat-seller, with a court this time ordering the defendant to pay $12m USD in damages.


Bungie filed a lawsuit against Romanian cheat-seller Mihai Claudiu-Florentin - who it claimed was behind Destiny 2 cheating software VeteranCheats - last year, alleging (thanks TheGamePost) copyright infringement, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), violations of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA), and intentional interference with contractual relations.


Bungie had been seeking $11,696,000 in damages, a figure based on the $2,000 Claudiu-Florentin would make from each sale of VeteranCheats across a total of 5,848 downloads. The Washington Western District Court has now granted Bungie's request, deeming the studio to have sufficiently proven its claims of copyright infringement and breach of contract, but not of the CPA violation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity Software - the company behind the widely used Unity game engine - has announced its third round of layoffs in under 12 months, this time affecting 600 jobs, equating to approximately 8% of its total workforce.


Today's job losses were confirmed in a company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with Unity only saying the move would affect "specific teams" as it continues to "position itself for long-term and profitable growth".


According to the Wall Street Journal (paywalled), this latest round of layoffs will leave Unity with approximately 7,000 employees, and comes ahead of the San Francisco-based company's plans to reduce its current global network of offices from 58 to fewer than 30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PokÃ©mon TCG Live, the official free-to-play smartphone and desktop adaptation of the venerable trading card game, finally has a released day, and will be launching on 8th June.


The PokÃ©mon Company announced PokÃ©mon TCG Live all the way back in 2021, with the expectation it would get a soft launch in Canada that same year. Not long after, however, both the mobile soft launch and global open beta for desktop were formally delayed to 2022 to create a "more polished experience".


With TCG Live's current beta period now nearing its end, The PokÃ©mon Company is finally ready to share a launch date, and all versions - that is the iOS and Android app, alongside a desktop release for Mac and Windows - will arrive at 6pm BST/10am PDT on 8th June.

Previously, this remastered version of Spider-Man's PS4 outing was reserved for those who decided to splash out on Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition.


Those who already own any of the original PS4 versions of the game will be able to upgrade to the remastered PS5 version for $10. Meanwhile, If you are buying the game for the first time, it will set you back $49.99. There is no word on UK pricing for now, but Eurogamer has asked Sony for clarification. A quick PSA, those PlayStation Plus members who claimed any edition of Marvel's Spider-Man via their subscription are not eligible for the PS5 upgrade.

Suspicions were triggered when the department detected unusual traffic emanating from one of its servers that was running a trial version of the Orion software suite made by SolarWinds, according to sources familiar with the incident. The software, used by system administrators to manage and configure networks, was communicating externally with an unfamiliar system on the internet. The DOJ asked the security firm Mandiant to help determine whether the server had been hacked. It also engaged Microsoft, though itâs not clear why the software maker was also brought onto the investigation...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The Heist and The Hazardous, which was unveiled as part of Saints Row's updated roadmap back in March, is the first of three promised content drops for the open-world crime caper's paid Expansion Pass, bringing new story missions, events, cosmetics, and more.


THQ Nordic still hasn't shared much in the way of specifics beyond that, but we do now know it'll see the Saints embarking on an adventure to exact "sweet revenge" after obnoxious movie star Chris Hardy double-crosses the Boss on a successful assassination hit.

Convergence (or CONV/RGENCE, if you really must) is the third entry in Riot Forge's genre-hopping, externally developed A League of Legends Story series, which takes familiar faces from Riot Games' wildly popular MOBA and deposits them in their own standalone adventures. 


So far, the series has featured a turn-based RPG from developer Airship Syndicate, titled Ruined King: A League of Legends Story, as well as Choice Provisions' puzzler Hextech Mayhem, and last month's action-RPG The Mageseeker, created by Digital Sun. It's all change again for Convergence, which shines a spotlight on League of Legends' dimension-hopping, time-manipualiting Ekko, and brings yet another a new genre focus.

Midnight Suns - which blends card-battling turn-based combat and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building into a superb superhero strategy whole - had a bit of a bumpy road to release, getting two delays before it finally launched for PC, Series X/S, and PS5 last December.


At the time of its second delay, 2K made the surprise announcement it was postponing Marvel's Midnight Suns for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Switch indefinitely, only saying those versions would launch at "a later date" - and we've had no further updates until today.

Creative mode functions pretty much as you'd expect, offering what looks to be an intuitive, fully featured construction toolkit available directly in-game. Mediatonic demoed the new mode in today's reveal livestream, explaining that, at launch, players will be able to build Races levels using either Fall Guys' original or new digital themes - with additional themes, round types, obstacles, and music set to be added in future updates.


After budding builders have selected their round type and theme, Creative mode then whisks them into a new building view, where they can call up a list of available objects, grouped by category, including obstacles, decorations, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper is being adapted into a tabletop RPG named Cycles of the Eye.


Like the video game, it's a solo game broken down into turns called cycles with your energy represented by dice. However, Cycles of the Eye is driven by a tarot deck of cards to represent challenges, resources, characters and more.


Citizen Sleeper was inspired by TTRPGs so this adaptation certainly makes sense.

The video, below, gives us a good idea of what to expect from the film, which is directed by District 9's Neill Blomkamp and stars the sad cop from Stranger Things and the elf who notices they're taking the hobbits to Isengard in Lord of the Rings. 


The Gran Turismo movie is about a Gran Turismo fan who enters a competition to become a professional racer. It's based on a true story about Jann Mardenborough, who did just that in real-life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wondered what Zelda's Adventure would be like on Game Boy? Well, wonder no more, as one intrepid fan has taken one of the series' least well-received games and turned it into something that actually looks pretty great. 


Admittedly, Zelda's Adventure is not exactly canon in the series' timeline. Developed by Viridis Corporation, it was published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i back in 1996. 


Despite featuring a playable Zelda (in Zelda's Adventure, it is Link who has been whisked away by Ganon), the game was pretty poorly received by, well, everyone. Everything from its graphics to its acting came under fire, and even some of the most die hard Zelda fans have generally avoided it.

Skywind is the ambitious mod project that rebuilds Bethesda's much-loved 2002 role-playing game The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind in the Skyrim engine.


Work on Skywind has gone on for years now, but this latest video, below, shows the project is coming along nicely. It shows 20 minutes of new footage, including new world spaces, creatures, environment assets, voice lines, item descriptions, user interface improvements and spells, and revolves around a quest from the original game called Necromancer in Mawia.

Thanks to an upcoming passive mode, those who simply want to take to the seas and bob around on the beautiful blue without having to worry about the denizens of the deep interrupting their serenity will be able to do just that. In short, when this free update goes live, "monsters that usually attack fishing boats will no longer be aggressive". 


As well as this new feature, Dredge players can also expect a new photo mode (that comes with a new in-game character) and the addition of map markers in the future.

Following a fairly glitchy release - particularly on PC - and an initial day one update, EA is now in the process of fixing its game. (Digital Foundry went so far as to call Star Wars Jedi: Survivor  "the worst triple-A PC port of 2023 so far".)  PC players will likely have already noticed a new patch, while those on consoles can expect to see this wave of fixes going live at some point today (2nd May).


 EA says this particular patch will fix multiple crashes, including those tied to skipping cinematics. It will also address various collision issues within the game, and enemy AI should no longer T-pose when players take a spin with Jedi: Survivor's photo mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm has released what looks like the first tease for the upcoming Mortal Kombat 12.


At the end of a video, below, in which Mortal Kombat developers thank fans for their support over the past 30 years, is a brief clip showing what looks like grains of sand falling from an hourglass. One of these grains of sand, perhaps the last, explodes.


What does it mean? As you'd expect, Mortal Kombat fans are having their say. The consensus is the tease relates to Kronika's Hourglass. Kronika, the antagonist of Mortal Kombat 11 and the self-styled Keeper of Time and Architect of History, used the Hourglass to alter time and space, which led to the fun interactions between young and old versions of the same character in Mortal Kombat 11.

Yesterday, Twitch and Discord streams showing footage of the game were available to view, two weeks ahead of the game's official launch date, before eventually being pulled offline.


It's unclar where the leak originated, or how many copies have been made available. But while a small number of physical copies appearing in the wild may be a headache for Nintendo, the fact the game has been pirated to share and play on PC is much more of a nightmare.

Kubernetes 1.20 introduced the ContainerResource type metric
in HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA).
In Kubernetes 1.27, this feature moves to beta and the corresponding feature gate (HPAContainerMetrics) gets enabled by default.
What is the ContainerResource type metric
The ContainerResource type metric allows us to configure the autoscaling based on resource usage of individual containers.
In the following example, the HPA controller scales the target
so that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is around 60%.
(See the algorithm details
to know how the desired replica number is calculated exactly)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends: Arsenal, the 17th season of the ever popular battle royale, will land on Tuesday, 9th May. Alongside map changes, a new mastery system, and evac towers, we're being treated to a brand new Legend to kick this season off with a bang.
August "Ballistic" Brinkman is a veteran of the Thunderdome Games, the predecessor to the Apex Games we know today.  After a tragedy, Ballistic retired and disappeared from public view. Until now, that is, with Ballistic back and ready to show the younger generation of Legends just how it's done.
Ballistic's abilities are well suited to both ranged and close quarters combat in any mode you choose to play. However, he truly shines at singling out a target and taking them out in a stylish manner. His passive 'The Sling' allows him to carry a third weapon but only with its base statistics. This means no attachments or upgrades, if you put a purple tier weapon in, it will instantly become its base tier. His tactical 'Whistler' can overheat enemy weapons, and his ultimate 'Tempest' buffs not only him but his entire team with infinite ammunition for a period of time.

The main event gets underway at 6pm in the UK/10am PT on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and, inevitably, Horizon Worlds, but Meta is also holding a pre-show starting 15 minutes earlier that, it says, will feature "game updates and debut trailers".


Once the pre-amble is out the way, Oculus Studios executive producer Ruth Bram will take the stage to present Meta Quest's big announcements, and that'll be followed by a post-show developer roundtable, promising a "deep-dive conversation around some upcoming games".

Many of you may have already come across the enemy Mogu, a big space troll thing that packs a punch. Trouble is, it turns out that the troll hits so hard, in some cases it smashes your XP clean off â or into â the map so that you can't recover it.  

In a reddit post entitled "don't die to this troll, he eats your XP", u/slaymaker1907 reports that there "seems to be a bug where if you die to this very particular troll, you can't get your XP back".

Issues first began to pop up shortly after the update was rolled out, and despite tweets and messages from developer Infinity Ward assuring players that it was "investigating", the problems still persist for some.

The issue has primarily been affecting players with AMD Vega GPUs and other Vega hardware, resulting in almost immediate crashes for PC players trying to access either Modern Warfare 2 or Warzone 2.0.

We already knew the Super Mario Bros. Movie was doing alright for itself, and that it's now officially the highest grossing film of 2023 so far and the biggest video game adaptation of all time, but if it does hit that milestone later today, it will only be the 10th animated movie to do so.

That's according to The Hollywood Reporter, which says the North American projected weekend gross for the movie is $37.5 million for a domestic tally of $487.5 million through Sunday.

If you pass a certain point early in the game â usually within the first two to three hours, although this depends upon how quickly you're trying to get through the story, of course â and die before you save, you risk respawning into a trapped location, effectively blocking your progress.

Like the OP, it's not possible to warn you of the issue without at least spoiling a couple of non-story things, so proceed with caution if you're anxious to play without any spoilers whatsoever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US ratings board ESRB has revealed a new Tomb Raider collection is on the way to Switch.

Whilst the games included in the collection have not been named, it's likely they are spin-offs Guardian of Light and Temple of Osiris, as the Switch port for those titles was quietly delayed at the end of last year.

"This is a collection of two action-adventure games in which players help Lara Croft and her allies search for artifacts to stop ancient gods from destroying the world," the rating's description explains, again without specifically confirming what the two games are called.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Star Wars Jedi: Survivor continues to rack up negative reviews on Steam for its PC performance issues, EA has released a statement to purchasers saying it's "aware [the game] isn't performing to our standards" and insisting it's "committed to fixing these issues".


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor recieved a favourable critical reception earlier this week - Eurogamer called it "really fun" despite a "lack of focus" - but reports of serious PC performance problems soon emerged following today's launch. Currently, the game has a "mostly negative" rating on Steam, with users highlighting poor frame rates, crashes, and more.


Prior to launch, EA had already promised players it would be deploying patches over the next few weeks to fix bugs, improve performance, and expand on accessibility features - hardly an encouraging start for customers expected to pay up to Â£70 for the game - but now the publisher has addressed Jedi: Survivor's reported PC flaws in more direct terms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One day after word of its US air date began to circulate, Sony's Twisted Metal live-action television series has received its first trailer.


More accurately, today's first look is being described as an "official teaser", which probably does a better job of managing your expectations. It's short on action - and pretty much anything at all you might think of when you hear the words "Twisted Metal" - but it does introduce Anthony Mackie in his starring role.


Mackie, you might recall, plays a "motor-mouthed outsider" who's offered a chance at a better life, as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland. We don't get to see much of that in today's teaser, but there is a vaguely amusing musical bait-and-switch, a bit of aerial footage, and thankfully - given the video game series' vehicular combat roots - at least one shot of a car with some guns stuck to the front.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Vampire Survivors animated TV series is in the works.

Deadline reports the indie hit is set for a TV adaptation courtesy of Story Kitchen, which is working with Vampire Survivors creator Luca "Poncle" Galante.


In Vampire Survivors you move a pixelly character around a simple top-downish environment that steadily fills with enemies. Your character attacks automatically so you just wander around, avoiding directly connecting with enemies while putting them within damage range. Enemies drop experience orbs when they die for you to collect, and when you level up you get to spend your experience on a random choice of new attacks or perks or buffs.

Australian twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou are in final negotiations to direct the live-action adaptation of the famous fighting game franchise, according to Hollywood Reporter.


We don't know anything about the movie yet, although Hollywood Reporter speculates that if the up-and-coming Philippous are being hired off the back of Talk to Me (trailer below), "tension and gore may be on the agenda." Perhaps we'll see Ryu split Sagat's chest open with a Dragon Punch?

It's a question Xbox boss Phil Spencer reportedly answered to staff at an all-hands meeting on Thursday, according to Bloomberg (paywall).


According to Bloomberg, Spencer stressed Microsoft remains committed to getting the deal over the line while acknowledging the damaging impact of this week's events. The company, alongside Activision Blizzard, plans to appeal.

Over on Steam, the game currently sits with a "mostly negative" reception, with many lamenting its poor performance. At the time of writing, only 34 percent of Steam reviews for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor are positive. 


"Runs like my ass after Taco Bell," wrote one player, and they are far from alone with this sentiment (although, so far at least, alone with that particular wording).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has released a new update for its Steam Client Beta. 


This update adds a swathe of pretty nifty features and improvements, including the ability to pin windows from the overlay, so they appear on top of the game while in-game. This means that, in Valve's words, "yes, you can watch movies while you play games if you really want to" (although, I think it really meant this feature to be more for things like guides and notes). 


As for those notes, this update adds a Notes app. The app does pretty much everything you would expect it to. It lets you take down notes about your game, and comes with "rich text formatting, the ability to have multiple notes per game, and can even be used in offline mode". Your notes will be saved per game, and are then synced to other PCs that you are logged into.

"Those sorts of claims are not borne out by the facts," a spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said last night (via Reuters).

"While it's still early for the emerging cloud segment in gaming, this new partnership combined with our other recent commitments will make more popular games available on more cloud game streaming services than they are today."

Kubernetes v1.26 introduced a new, alpha-level feature for
StatefulSets that controls
the ordinal numbering of Pod replicas. As of Kubernetes v1.27, this feature is
now beta. Ordinals can start from arbitrary
non-negative numbers. This blog post will discuss how this feature can be
used.
Background
StatefulSets ordinals provide sequential identities for pod replicas. When using
OrderedReady Pod management
Pods are created from ordinal index 0 up to N-1.
With Kubernetes today, orchestrating a StatefulSet migration across clusters is
challenging. Backup and restore solutions exist, but these require the
application to be scaled down to zero replicas prior to migration. In today's
fully connected world, even planned application downtime may not allow you to

There's quite a lot going on in Rise of Rome - which purchasers will need to switch to from the main screen in order to access its new stuff - but the most notable addition for series fans is arguably the return of all 16 civilisations from the original Age of Empires and Rise of Rome.


That means the Assyrians, Babylonians, Carthaginians, Choson, Egyptians, Greeks, Hittites, Macedonians, Minoans, Palmyrans, Persians, Phoenicians, Romans, Shang, Sumerians, and Yamato will all be playable in Rise of Rome, with the Romans being unique in that they'll also be available to play in Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition's base game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane's co-op vampire shooter Redfall is just a week away now, and as the clock ticks down to release, Microsoft has shared a bunch of new info, including a new trailer, details on its accessibility options, and its PC system requirements - the latter being particularly intriguing in light of the recently announced 30fps limit on consoles.


Starting with Redfall's accessibility options, these have now been shared as part of a full "settings" breakdown over on Arkane's blog. Accessbility options, specifically, include the likes of text-to-speech and speech-to-text support, screen narration, subtitles and closed captioning, font scaling, a colour blindness filter, notification duration settings, and an optional "accessibility reticule" for anyone that would benefit from a permanent fixation point on-screen.


Arkane has also provided an extensive list of more general settings, highlighting things like toggleable head bob and camera shake, optional object highlights, and four difficulty settings - three of which are available when first starting the game. It's well worth checking out the full article for the considerably more expanded breakdown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros' co-op action-adventure Gotham Knights has just received another update, this one bringing fixes, accessibility improvements, and a surprise new 15-floor Heroic Assault raid.


Gotham Knights, of course, recieved a lukewarm reception when it launched last October, with particularly stern words being saved for its myriad technical issues. Since then, developer Warner Bros Montreal has been tinkering under the hood to improve the experience - with notable success, as Digital Foundry noted recently - making today's update the latest in a long line of patches.


With most of the game's glaring technical issues seemingly now resolved, its latest update - which notably features accessibility improvements such as controller remapping, improved screen-reader support, and button press toggles, as detailed in the accompanying patch notes - is less about fixes and more about new content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little over two years after first details emerged, the Twisted Metal live-action TV series has a US air date, with its premiere now set for 27th July.


This 10 half-hour-long episode adaptation of the primarily PlayStation-exclusive vehicular combat series - which, slightly alarmingly, is now approaching its 30th anniversary - tells the story of a motor-mouthed outsider (played by Anthony Mackie) who's offered a chance at a better life, as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland.


Sony first touted turning Twisted Metal into a television show back in 2019, but it wasn't until 2021 that the wheels officially got in motion. Since then, US subscription service Peacock has placed an order for the action comedy, while Cobra Kai's Michael Jonathan Smith has signed up as showrunner and to pen the scripts - which are based on a concept by Zombieland and Deadpool writing duo Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Point and click puzzle game The Case of the Golden Idol will receive a new expansion next month. 


On 4th May, players will be able to head into the game's The Spider of Lanka expansion, in a bid to puzzle out just what exactly is going on across three new scenarios. This expansion will be in a completely new setting. In fact, so new, it is all taking place "thousands of miles from the rainy hills of Blackfield."


The Spider of Lanka kicks off a year before The Case of the Golden Idol's first scenario, and follows the story of Albert Cloudsley and Oberon Geller as they make their maiden voyage to the Kingdom of Lanka. Here, they will visit... actually, I can't tell you that. In the true spirit of The Case of the Golden Idol, that information has been redacted. I can share this trailer with you though, so please do sit back and enjoy.

The understanding of how to secure AI systems, we concluded, lags far behind their widespread adoption. Many AI products are deployed without institutions fully understanding the security risks they pose. Organizations building or deploying AI models should incorporate AI concerns into their cybersecurity functions using a risk management framework that addresses security throughout the AI system life cycle. It will be necessary to grapple with the ways in which AI vulnerabilities are different from traditional cybersecurity bugs, but the starting point is to assume that AI security is a subset of cybersecurity and to begin applying vulnerability management practices to AI-based features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega of America is currently "investigating and considering the options available" to the company, following the news earlier this week that a "supermajority" of its employees were planning to unionise.


As Matt reported on Monday, this union - which calls itself the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega, or AEGIS-CWA for short - aims to secure higher base pay, improved benefits, and a number of other goals.


In response, Sega of America's president and COO Ian Curran wrote a letter to all employees, addressing the formation of AEGIS.

However, one of his more recent posts has caused quite a stir from his followers. Earlier today, the Metal Gear creator shared a picture of himself standing beside Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud (there was also a Kojima Productions mascot there).


For a bit of background, Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud is president of the Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS) and the Arab eSports Federation. He is also vice president of the Global Esports Federation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The number of people playing Activision Blizzard games each month has dropped back down to levels previously seen last summer, before a brief boost bestowed by big releases such as Overwatch 2 and Call of Duty in the back half of last year.


Monthly active users for Activision games - primarily its Call of Duty series - fell to 98 million as of the 31st March, down from 111 million at the end of December 2022. 


It's a figure roughly equal to that seen at the end of September last year, before the arrival of Modern Warfare 2 and the big 2.0 relaunch of live service Warzone in November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is releasing tomorrow across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Along with a now customary day one patch, the team at EA has additionally stated it will be releasing several more patches for the game in the "weeks ahead", begging the question - is Star Wars Jedi: Survivor actually ready for launch? 


In a brief update, EA said players can expect patches that will fix bugs, improve the game's performance and add more accessibility features in the weeks following Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's launch.


The language used by EA and early reports from some reviewers have left some fans wondering whether the game needed longer before launch, rather than arriving with issues that need to be subsequently ironed out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog has released a fourth update for its widely lambasted PC port of The Last of Us Part 1, promising "framerate optimisation" and more among its various bug fixes and tweaks.


As you may recall, The Last of Us Part 1 finally launched for PC at the end of March after a 25-day delay designed to ensure it would debut "in the best shape possible." Unfortunately, the reality of the release didn't live up to that promise, and PC purchasers on Steam quickly began reporting a host of technical issues, including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - earning the port a Mostly Negative rating.


Since then, Naughty Dog has released three patches aimed at addressing the PC port's various problems, and those fixes have slowly helped nudge The Last of Us Part 1's Steam rating up to a marginally less disastrous Mixed. And today's 1.0.4 update aims to improve matters further, bringing an extensive list of changes focused around "framerate optimisation, graphical and texture fidelity, crash fixes, and more".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a bunch of activity going on around developer Amplitude's sprawling historical 4X strategy game Humankind right now, and as part of all that, its newly released Para Bellum Wonder Pack DLC is currently free to claim and keep, but only for a limited time.


The Para Bellum Wonder Pack adds a total of six new cultural wonders, one for each of the game's successive eras. The Stables of Pi-Ramesses are available first in Era 1 and are followed by the Colosseum, the Citadel of Alamut, the HÃ´tel des Invalides, Whilelmshaven Werft, and, as we step into the modern era, the Pentagon.


As you might imagine, each Wonder brings various benefits to the empires that build them, ranging from increased land movement speed and reduced cavalry/land vehicle upkeep for the Stables of Pi-Ramesses through to increased district fortication and bombardment benefits via the Pentagon. A full breakdown of these bonuses can be found in Amplitude's announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we discuss the fallout from today's dramatic decision by the UK to block Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal, and whether an appeal could still turn things around. 

With the UK regulator issuing a stern warning over how it sees the deal impacting competitiveness among cloud gaming companies, it remains to be seen how much more Microsoft could do to reassure the UK without structurally changing the deal. Or does, perhaps, Microsoft say the UK should not have given up on this so easily, by saying a block on the deal was simply the most straightforward option?
So, do we think an appeal could still succeed? And what will it take? Joining me to share their thoughts are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

Luckily, help is on the way, with Picross S9 officially launching tomorrow, 27th April.


This ninth mainline series entry on Switch introduces a grand total of 485 new puzzles, so plenty of fresh deductive, dot-plopping column action to be getting on with. 300 of those are Picross and Mega Picross puzzles, 150 are Clip Picross, 30 are Colour Picross, and the remaining five are Extra puzzles - three of which will require you to link play data from Picross S6, S7, and S8.


Additionally, the local co-op mode introduced in Picross' previous instalment makes a return in S9, meaning up to four players can work together to solve its new conundrums.

Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong and Funky Kong all pop up in a quick teaser posted by Lego to Twitter this afternoon. It remains to be seen how many extra sets you'll need to buy to collect them all.

The piece, for you music nerds, was composed by Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov as an interlude for his opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan (composed from 1899-1900). It's a notoriously tricky piece full of fast, buzzing melodies.


Thankfully, this latest update to the game also adds in a Practice Mode so players can reduce the speed by up to 50 percent. Phew!

Nintendo's appearance at Gamescom suggests it will have something meaningful to show there. But what? The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4 will both have been released by the time Gamescom opens in late August. Could Nintendo have something hardware related to unveil to the world?


With the all-conquering Nintendo Switch in its sixth year of life, it certainly feels about time the Japanese company at least talked about what's next.

Appealing today's decision will be a lengthy process for Microsoft, and hamper any chance of the deal being approved globally for months - and that's without the separate decisions still due from the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU's European Commission, both of which are still scrutinising the deal for themselves.


"According to the Competition Appeal Tribunal site, straightforward cases are aimed to be dealt with within nine months," games industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told Eurogamer today. "If the appeal is successful it is then returned to the CMA to review. This again will take some time.

You can expect more of the teams' eclectic flair in this latest offering of new and older games. Young Horses has released IndependANT, Antbassador, Snakedate and Octodad: Student Edition under its "Free Range initiative". While the developer calls these releases "smaller side projects", each of them looks like a lot of fun to while away some time.

The decision by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority prevents Microsoft from buying the publisher behind Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, follows earlier concerns it would lead to an unfair impact on archrival PlayStation. 

Instead, today's decision stems from the CMA's concerns over the deal's proposed impact on the cloud gaming sector. In today's final report, the CMA said Microsoft's ownership of Activision Blizzard risked "stifling competition in this growing market". In response, Microsoft has said it will now appeal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Later today, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is set to give its verdict on Microsoft's proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


While this may give a strong indication as to whether the merger is approved globally, the US Federal Trade Commision (FTC) still has the hearing for its complaint to stop the merger filed back in December. That's set for 2nd August, after Microsoft's 18th July merger deadline expires.



As such, Microsoft is planning a swift end to the FTC's deal concerns, reports the New York Post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's gaming revenue fell four percent and Xbox hardware revenue declined 30 percent in the latest financial quarter, the company has reported.


While Microsoft does not report console sales and did not provide an updated number for Game Pass subscribers (it had 25m as of January 2022), it's clear the company is struggling to sell Xbox consoles. In fact Xbox console sales have struggled for some time. Xbox Series X and S sales were down during the crucial holiday quarter last year, and it looks like they were down in the quarter ending 31st March this year, too.


The only bright spot for Microsoft was a slight three percent increase in Xbox content and services revenue. The company said this was "driven by better-than-expected monetisation in third-party and first-party content, and growth in Xbox Game Pass".

To date, Rusty Lake has released 16 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - blending casual point-and-click puzzling and room-escape-style conundrums into a wonderfully sinister, narratively intertwined saga charting the lives of the Vanderboom family.


As with developer Rusty Lake's last few titles, the newly announced Underground Blossom ditches the Rusty Lake moniker but is still very much set in its sprawling universe, this time taking players on a journey via the Rusty Lake underground system through the life and memories of Laura Vanderboom - first introducd all the way back in Cube Escape: Seasons.

Starting with Steam Deck verification, 1.2 remedies a range of problems, meaning initial loading and log-in should now function properly, prompts should no longer flicker between gamepad and mouse/keyboard controls, and the virtual keyboard should now correctly appear as needed. Obsidian has also optimised and tuned Grounded's default graphics settings on Steam Deck for a more "enjoyable experience".


Elsewhere, Grounded's 1.2 update introduces new foes in the form of wasps, which can be found guarding their mini-hives around the yard or situated in more challenging Wasp Nests, where players can also encounter the new Wasp Queen boss. Defeating Grounded's latest enemies will unlock new items to craft, including armour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega is readying itself for a summer of maraca-shaking mayhem it moves to bring its classic rhythm-action game Samba de Amigo to Switch - and ahead of its arrival, the publisher has revealed 20 of the 40 tracks it'll be shipping with on launch day.


Samba de Amigo: Party Central, as Sega is calling this new Switch version, takes the infectious rhythm-action of the Dreamcast original - which sees players following on-screen prompts to furiously shake their maracas in time with the music and in the desired position - but spices things up with a bunch of new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress.


Sega previously confirmed Party Central would feature 40 tracks at launch, but was a little vague about what they might be beyond a couple of Sonic the Hedgehog tunes. Now, though, it's revealed 20 of the licensed tracks players can rhythmically flail to, with artists including Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepson, and Gloria Gaynor, plus some returning song favourites, such as Ricky Martin's La Copa de la Vida and La Bamba.

        <updated>2023-04-25T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After its initial reveal on April 1st this year, Asus is finally ready to shed more light on its ROG Ally handheld gaming PC, which launches on May 11th and will be sold by Currys in the UK. The Steam Deck competitor looks to be a more premium device than Valve's offering, with a faster AMD Ryzen Z1 series processor, seven-inch 1080p 120Hz touch screen and Windows 11 - but no price has yet been announced. 
The hardware side of the equation is perhaps the most fascinating, so let's begin there. The Ally is powered by a 'custom' Ryzen Z1 chipset that includes Zen 4 CPU cores and RDNA 3 graphics produced on a 4nm node. (By comparison, current Ryzen 7000 desktop designs use a mixture of 5nm and 6nm processes, which should give the Ally's APU an advantage in terms of performance per watt.) We expect to see configurations of the device featuring the Z1 (6C/12T, 22MB cache, 2.8TF 4CU GPU) and Z1 Extreme (8C/16T, 24MB cache, 8.6TF 12CU GPU) processors announced by AMD earlier today, offering increasing levels of horsepower for a higher asking price. 
Speaking of which, the impressive-looking APU is backed with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM in dual-channel mode, while storage is up to a 512GB PCIe 4.0 SSD and UHS-2 Micro SD card expansion - faster than what is available on the Deck, which is limited to PCIe 3.0 storage and UHS-1 Micro SD cards. Wi-Fi 6E is also included, in comparison to WiFi 5 on Steam Deck. It'll be interesting to see whether all SKUs of the Ally come with the full complement of RAM and storage, or whether this will be pared back on the cheaper options.

Wowhead covered a report from Sina Technology that claimed NetEase has filed a lawsuit in Shanghai against Blizzard seeking Â¥300 million in refunds for discontinued games and services to the over one million players it had in the region before servers were shut down in January.


World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm and the StarCraft series became unplayable in China on 24th January, when NetEase's licence expired (mobile game Diablo Immortal was unaffected).

For those keeping track, this trailer is the finished product from last week's leaked footage. Titled "You can do what?!", the TV spot highlights some of Link's new abilities, such as Fuse and Ultrahand. 


We can see Link creating a hovercraft of sorts to coast over the lands of Hyrule. Then, he battles a Flame Gleeok (essentially confirming the theory that we will be facing different varieties of Gleeok enemy in Tears of the Kingdom) with a fused shield and he uses his Ascend ability to pop up through an enemy camp. You can see the trailer for yourself below:

Diablo veterans will be familiar with the consequences of death when playing hardcore characters. Indeed, Blizzard has in the past warned Diablo players it is in no way responsible for their hardcore characters, and will not restore them under any circumstances.

Announced at the tail-end of 2021, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which is being developed by Sumo Nottingham, sounds pretty par for the course amid the current crop of asymmetrical horror games like Dead by Daylight and Evil Dead: The Game.


It pits a brand-new cast of youthful "victims" against a single, powerful foe - in this case, a killer family member either plucked from or inspired by Tobe Hooper's 1974 horror classic.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores below.

Previously, Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores saw its user rating drop to as low as 2.7.

This latest unionisation effort is being organised in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America labour union - which has previously assisted employees at the likes of Activision Blizzard King and ZeniMax Studios - and represents a broad selection of departments and disciplines at Sega's  Irvine, California headquarters.


According to Axios, the group - which calls itself the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega, or AEGIS-CWA for short - consists of 144 employees with roles across marketing, localisation, product development, and quality assurance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a 2021 ruling on Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit against Apple, which both parties had appealed.


Epic launched its lawsuit against the iPhone maker in August 2020, following the company's decision to revoke Epic's Fortnite developer account, blocking the battle royale game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees.


The following year, California's Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. However, Gonzalez-Rogers did side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers linking out to alternative payment methods from within apps - a practice known as "anti-steering" - as that would constitute "anti-competitive conduct" under state law.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might have had a bit of a tumultuous development journey - to put it mildly - but Dead Island 2 is off to a flying start, having successfully shifted over 1m copies in its first three days of release.


Dead Island 2 finally launched last Friday, almost nine years after publisher Deep Silver announced it was in development. Since then, it's seen no less than three studios at the helm, but, despite that rocky road to release, its final form - which reached the finish line under the stewardship of Dambuster Studios - has clearly captured the public's imagination.


In its press release announcing Dead Island 2's blast through the 1m sales barrier in just 72 hours, Deep Silver shared a selection of other notable stats. Over the course of those three days since launch, for instance, players have racked up 11m hours of play time, and 28m deaths.

As is now customary, Ballistic - real name August Montgomery Brinkman - gets his grand unveiling in a new episode of Respawn's Stories from the Outlands. Here, we meet him taking a lonely stroll through his lavish mansion before settling down for a recap of his Thunderdome career, which ended tragically with the death of his teammate and brother-in-law.


Since then, Ballistic has become a recluse, neglecting his family until they chose to leave. Which is where Respawn's cinematic switches back to the present, and when we - and Ballistic - learn his son, Nathaniel, has just qualified for the Apex Games.

While nothing has been officially announced, according to Lego leaker Falconbricks, this set will be released on 1st June and sell for $269.99 (so, around Â£217). Meanwhile, it is said to have 2651 pieces.

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is one of three key regulators around the world still scrutinising Microsoft's deal, alongside the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU's European Commission. 


A final ruling by the CMA must arrive before the end of its deadline day - this Wednesday, 26th April - and Microsoft has recently had reason to hope its efforts to win over the UK authority will ultimately prove successful.

LawBreakers was a hero shooter developed by Boss Key Productions, the now defunct studio set up by Cliff "CliffyB" Bleszinski after he left Epic having famously worked on the Unreal Tournament and Gears of War franchises.


Despite a big pre-release push by publisher Nexon, LawBreakers flopped, with its Steam concurrent player count peaking at 7482 in June 2017 when it launched via open beta. Nexon later blamed LawBreakers' disastrous fortunes on battle royale PUBG, which at the time was just about the biggest game in the world.

The Division 2 originally launched back in March 2019, with versions for PS4, Xbox One and PC. Streaming versions for Google Stadia and Amazon Luna launched in 2020, and it is playable now on new consoles via backwards compatibility.

Last week, The Division 2's fifth year of content was laid out for fans of Ubisoft's ongoing post-pandemic co-op shooter. Speaking to MP1st, the game's creative director Yannick Banchereau also discussed whether a ground-up PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version could also release - but it seems unlikely.

Whilst there's been no formal word from EA about the additional requirement, players who've spotted the physical game out in the wild have reportedly noticed that the boxed copies sport a sticker on the front that says "download required".

This may not come as a surprise to some given EA recently published the minimum and recommended PC specifications for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which stated that Jedi Survivor takes up 155GB on PC, and discs can only hold so much data, of course.

Far Cry 6, Riders Republic, Rainbow Six Extraction, and Monopoly Madness are set to come to the Steam store on 11th May, 8th June, 15th June, and 22nd June, respectively, marking the first time these titles will be playable on Steam.

Since 2019, Ubisoft had skipped bringing its game to Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12 per cent revenue cut compared to Valve's 30 per cent.

Over the past several months you have logged many hours aiding the Mortician in daily tasks along with learning the ins and outs of the embalming process as well as how to properly handle and care for the deceased," teases the description on the Nintendo Shop.

All this comes via Sons of the Forest's patch #4, which, while fairly light on radical new features, brings a host of welcome quality of life improvements - including the aforementioned Kelvin buff meaning he can now carry a whopping two logs at once - plus tweaks, and more. 


There's some new stuff on the feature front, though, including a new Action Cam used to view Sons of the Forest's found footage tapes - the first of which is now in-game - plus new points of interest discovery laptops, and the ability to name save games.

There's a lot going on in Relics of the Old Faith, as the update is known, starting with the introduction of Relics and heavy attacks as part of Cult of the Lamb's improved combat. It also adds remixed dungeons featuring revamped enemies and bosses, including new versions of the base game's four Guardian Bishops as confirmed during Nintendo's indie showcase.


Away from the dungeon-crawling side of things, Massive Monster says the game's cult management portion will get new followers, plus a range of new buildings - including a kitchen with its own chef for more efficient cooking, a (non-collapsing) shared shelter capable of housing up to three followers, a crypt to keep graveyard sizes under control, plus farm plot signs which followers can plant stuff around for better crop organisation.

<blockquote><p>Some might consider these actions cheating, while the acting player would argue that there was no rule that said the action couldn&#8217;t be performed. So, how do we address these situations, and close those loopholes? We make new rules that specifically address the loophole action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has announced Victoria 3's first paid expansion, a new "immersion pack" titled Voice of the People, which launches on 22nd May.


Voice of the People's main new feature is introduction of ideological "agitators" from across history, including Victor Hugo and Karl Marx. Agitators are a new kind of character in Victoria 3, capable of rallying pops to support political movements that align with their ideology.


"Agitators will shake up your internal politics, acting independently of their Interest Groups," Paradox explains in a blog post accompanying its DLC announcement. "Amplifying power from below, Agitators serve an opposite function to Interest Group Petitions which reflect the demands of the political elite. Depending on how your goals align with theirs, Agitators might be a painful thorn in your side or a valuable ally to your political agenda."

The claim Hi-Fi Rush had failed to meet Microsoft's financial expectations was made by Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb during his latest Game Mess Decides podcast.

"Based on what I've heard," Grubb said during a conversation about the game's release strategy, "it just straight up didn't make the money it needed to make. I mean it got good reviews, the buzz was good, so where do you put the blame for something like that? Is it the price? Was it the shadow drop? Could it have sold more? Or is it Game Pass?".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darker and Darker's lawyer has accused Korean gaming company Nexon of "anti-competitive bully tactics", in a letter to Steam owner Valve. 


Following positive reception at Steam Next Fest earlier this year, Dark and Darker has experienced a troubled production. In March, developer Ironmace had its office searched, after Nexon alleged the studio created its game with code stolen from Nexon's own "P3" project (something several members of Ironmace's team had previously worked on). 


Soon after these allegations were made, Nexon issued Ironmace with a cease and desist demand, and Dark and Darker was removed from Steam. Most recently, it came to light that the Dark and Darker developer is being sued by Nexon for "copyright infringement", with the Korean game publisher demanding a jury trial in America.

It expands the map and makes meaningful gameplay, matchmaking and user interface changes, among many other things.

While the core objectives of the game are the same, with lanes the same distance from each other and win objectives still in the centre of the map, there's 40 percent more terrain, which means there's loads of room to gather resources.

Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature called Node log query that allows

What problem does it solve?
Cluster administrators face issues when debugging malfunctioning services
running on the node. They usually have to SSH or RDP into the node to view the
logs of the service to debug the issue. The Node log query feature helps with
this scenario by allowing the cluster administrator to view the logs using
kubectl. This is especially useful with Windows nodes where you run into the
issue of the node going to the ready state but containers not coming up due to
CNI misconfigurations and other issues that are not easily identifiable by
looking at the Pod status.

Specifically, Atari's new acquisitions span the PC and console game catalogues of publishers Micropose, Infogrames, Accolade, with Atari also now owning the Accolade trademark.


Sadly, the company hasn't shared a full list of the retro IP it now owns after its most recent splurge, so there'll be no time for lengthy bouts of nostalgia here - but its announcement did at least call out the aforementioned Bubsy and Demolition Racer, alongside Hardball, 1942: Pacific Air War, F-117A, and F-14 air combat series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has acquired developer Firewalk Studios from Bungie boss Harold Ryan's ProbablyMonsters collective, making it PlayStation's 20th first-party studio.


Firewalk was founded in 2018 as a subsidiary of ProbablyMonsters and is yet to release its first game. However, the studio announced a partnership with Sony in 2021 to create a new PlayStation-exclusive triple-A title focused on delivering "memorable multiplayer moments".


In a PlayStation Blog post announcing the acquisition, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst explained it was Firewalk's work on its still mysterious title - a project being headed by former Destiny creative director Ryan Ellis - that lead Sony to acquire the developer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dazzlingly chaotic crowd puzzler Humanity, which is being developed by Tokyo game studio THA in collaboration Tetris Effect developer Enhance, will be tumbling onto PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC on 16th May, and it'll be a day one PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue addition too.


Humanity, if you're unfamiliar, has been in development for a fair old while, with THA first showcasing the game back in 2017 before it re-emerged two years later with Enhance attached. It's remained an intriguing proposition throughout its journey, challenging players - in the role of a Shiba Inu - to corral huge, purposeless crowds.


There's a vague air of classic puzzler Lemmings about the whole thing as players let out a "woof" to control Humanity's vast swarms, making the crowds move, change direction, jump, float, or even fight in order to navigate Trials packed with traps and obstacles, and overcome enemies known as the Others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lone Echo developer Ready at Dawn has reportedly been heavily affected by the latest round of job cuts at Meta Quest and VR owner Meta, with one employee claiming a third of the studio has been laid off, including the studio head.


As originally reported by The Washington Post, today's layoffs could affect as many as 4,000 employees at Meta, and are part of the company's stated goal of cutting a further 10,000 jobs in 2023 following the 11,000 job losses announced last year.


The Washington Post claims Meta has targeted "highly skilled staff" - including engineers and other technical workers - in its latest round of layoffs, and, since its report, employees have said both Ready at Dawn and fellow Meta acquisition Downpour Interactive have been impacted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spooky visual novel Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is steeped in Japanese history. When you're not absorbing the sights of 1980s Tokyo or hearing ancient folk tales, Paranormasight feeds you bits of information about Japan during the wider ShÅwa era and the earlier Edo period.


Whether from decades or centuries ago, elements of Japanese history are woven into the game, something which Paranormasight director and writer Takaya Ishiyama told me more about, in a discussion which revealed more about the team's approach to using history in the game's narrative as a way to balance realism and mystery.


One of the first things you notice when playing Paranormasight is the difference in visual style between the environments and the characters. The game's cast were drawn by Kobayashi Gen, and his distinct style stands out from the surroundings in-game. The 360-degree panoramas you explore were all created from photographs, though this wasn't initially what the team set out to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast it's all about Zelda, and the many burning questions we still have surrounding the upcoming Tears of the Kingdom. 

Despite all the details to be found in Nintendo's final Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, there's still so much we don't know.  How much has changed in Hyrule since Breath of the Wild, and how many new areas are there to explore? Are there proper dungeons in the game this time around? What are the Tears of the Kingdom? 
With less than a month until launch, it's time for one final round of theorising - as the internet begins to entertain some wild theories that Ganon is actually good, or maybe just pulling a Thanos. Joining me to discuss it all - and place bets on whether Zelda really is playable - are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

Last week, Season 3 of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 went live alongside a bundle that includes controversial "bonus effects" for the extraction mode, DMZ.

For example, the Classic Ghost Pack, which costs 2400 CP, includes a free two-plate armour vest, a 15-minute insured weapon cooldown for each of the two guns included in the bundle, and adds one more active duty operator slot for DMZ.

However, fast forward six months and we now have an official trailer for the game. It's called Unrecord, and comes from a developer known simply as Drama.


Unrecord is described as a "single-player FPS that tells the story of a tactical police officer from the perspective of his body camera". You can see how it looks for yourself below - and its realism makes for slightly uncomfortable viewing.

For the first time, high quality scans of the artwork are being shared with the PokÃ©mon community in the hopes of archiving them.

The drawings depict the first 251 PokÃ©mon to appear in the games and were uploaded by YouTuber and PokÃ©mon archivist LewTwo to Twitter. The scans were sent to Lewtwo by Twitter user ExcaliburZero_Z.

The old scans are believed to have originated from the PokÃ©mon Red and Blue Player's Guide, Lewtwo explained, where they ended up with "inaccurate colors, were often misshapen, and generally very low quality".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores only released yesterday, but many players have already completed the DLC, and one particular moment during its ending has evoked a strong reaction from some fans. 


Please note, there are spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.


During the events of Burning Shores, Aloy meets Seyka, an "ambitious marine of the Quen tribe who has stepped up to help her people survive". Ahead of the DLC's release, Seyka was touted as a character that would be Aloy's equal, with actress Ashley Birch even saying "Aloy may have met her match".

Mario and Luigi's former boss Spike appears in the film as a stern foreman and rival for the brothers' new firm. The character is a deep cut from Mario canon, and originally appeared in the NES and arcade game Wrecking Crew back in the 1980s.


In Japan, Spike has always had the name "Blackie" - which for obvious reasons will no longer be used. Henceforth, the character will be re-named as "Spike" in any future appearances, and the Japanese dub of the Super Mario Bros. Movie will use "Spike" as well.

Quote tweeting a Twitter user's call for more Diablo 4 game time, the official Diablo Twitter account said: "That can be arrangedâ¦"


That's a pretty clear tease that some surprise way to play Diablo 4 ahead of release is planned. Whether that's a fresh open beta or early access remains to be seen. If you pre-order Diablo 4 you currently get early access from 2nd June, so this tweet suggests something even earlier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author: Chris Henzie (Google)
With the release of Kubernetes v1.27 the ReadWriteOncePod feature has graduated
to beta. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at this feature, what it
does, and how it has evolved in the beta release.
What is ReadWriteOncePod?
ReadWriteOncePod is a new access mode for
PersistentVolumes (PVs)
and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
introduced in Kubernetes v1.22. This access mode enables you to restrict volume
access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to
the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads
that require single-writer access to storage.
For more context on access modes and how ReadWriteOncePod works read
What are access modes and why are they important?

The original Blasphemous released back in 2019 to well-deserved acclaim, delivering a rock-solid 2D Metroidvania-meets-Souls-like that married a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling baroque imagery.


In its upcoming sequel, Blasphemous' original pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One returns for another adventure - tying into the first game's Wounds of Eventide update ending - set across a strange new labyrinthine land ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

Announced back in 2021 and initially expected to launch that same year, Oxenfree 2 is set five years after the memorable, dimension-shattering events of the original game. This time around, the story focuses on new protagonist Riley Poverly, an environmental researcher who returns to her small coastal hometown of Camena which, as you might already have guessed, is being plagued by mysterious radio signals.


Making matters worse, there's a cult on the loose, attempting to open a portal between worlds, but Riley has some useful new tricks to help her investigations. A new walkie talkie, for instance, means communiucation can occur between characters all across Camena even when they're not together, with conversation and dialogue choices affecting how events play out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Day Before developer Fntastic has re-emerged with news of a beta test for its highly-anticipated but held-up zombie MMO, ahead of a full release on 10th November. 


As a reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release in March, before its launch was delayed. In a bizarre series of events, it transpired that Fntastic had failed to trademark the game's name, which had since been contested by the company behind a calendar app. All traces of the game were subsequently removed from Steam and since then, very little has been heard at all.


The Day Before has now reemerged, however, with word from an administrator on the game's official Discord that a beta is now in the pipeline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has detailed the additions coming to Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak - including weather-manipulating elder dragon Amatsu - as part of the expansion's free April update, and has confirmed there'll be one final free update arriving in June.


Monster Hunter Rise's Title Update 5 (also referred to as Version 15) launches tomorrow, 20th April, and its flagship new arrival is the Looming Calamity, better known as the elder dragon Amatsu. This formidable creature can control the weather, conjuring violent storms and lightning strikes once it shows its true power, and is available to hunters at MR 10 or higher.


Amatsu is accompanied by Title Update 5's second creature addition, a powerful Risen variant Shagaru Magala, which becomes available at MR 180 or higher. As you'd expect, new equipment can be forged from the materials dropped by both creatures, including a fetching bit of Palamute outfit resembling floating armoured horse.

Several videos made by 3D pixel artist and designer Dott have surfaced in the past week, showing off what PokÃ©mon Red might look like if reimagined in an HD-2D style similar to recent Square Enix titles like Triangle Strategy and Octopath Traveler. 


It's a design which has sparked excitement from fans at how future PokÃ©mon remakes could be made, after the rather lacklustre response to 2021's PokÃ©mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and more general gripes about the series' visuals in all-new entries.

So, here are some of the current Tears of the Kingdom theories out there. (Beware elements that could be considered minor spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.)

Thalassophobia is classed as the persistent and intense fear of deep bodies of water, including the sea, oceans and even lakes. It is different from aquaphobia, which is a fear of water itself.


According to Guerrilla, this option aims to ease a player's thalassophobia by "improving underwater ambient visibility". Additionally, Aloy will be able to breathe indefinitely when under the water "regardless of story progression".

It's also now hit the US song charts as well, and has marked Black's first solo entry in the Billboard Hot 100. On YouTube, meanwhile, the song's music video has racked up 17m views in 11 days. Let's watch:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crank-based portable gaming curio Playdate has now sold over 53,000 units - more than twice the number its creator Panic had originally forecast.


Playdate was initially announced back in 2019, promising a unique (and dinkily adorable) spin on portable gaming that would see Panic teaming up with a host of noted indie game designers - including the likes of Zach Gage and Bennett Foddy - to produce a curated 24-game "season", as well as offering itch.io sideloading support and, more recently, an on-device store.


It was a pitch that clearly captured peoples' imaginations; Panic has now revealed the initial 20,000 Playdate units it produced based on its early sales predictions sold out within 20 minutes of the device being made available to purchase via a queue system last April.

The problem
On Linux with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled, it's traditionally
the container runtime that applies SELinux labels to a Pod and all its volumes.
Kubernetes only passes the SELinux label from a Pod's securityContext fields
to the container runtime.
The container runtime then recursively changes SELinux label on all files that
are visible to the Pod's containers. This can be time-consuming if there are
many files on the volume, especially when the volume is on a remote filesystem.
Note
subPath of a volume, only that subPath of the whole
volume is relabeled. This allows two pods that have two different SELinux labels
to use the same volume, as long as they use different subpaths of it.

With spring now in full swing, green-fingered sorts will have the seasonally appropriate opporunity to fashion their own horticultural hangouts as part of The Sims 4's new Greenhouse Haven Kit. This introduces glass pane windows and doors that can be connected to create new garden spaces, as well as a range of items to go inside - including hanging baskets, starter seedlings, a planting table, and range of pots.


Alternatively, for those who'd prefer to hide away from the sun's rays in grungy comfort, there's the Basement Treasures Kit, offering a selection of hand-me-down inspired furnishings. Expect the likes of worn and torn chairs and couches, crates of vinyl records, old trophies and family photos, battered chests, and  even an old cathode-ray tube TV.

And to add that extra layer of adventure and excitement, the app 'gamifies' your run by popping Marvel's heroes in your ear as they join you via the app's interactive stories. That said, you can also walk or jog (or perhaps even trot) your way through the storylines if you prefer.

Movie (which is now the biggest video game adaptation ever). Perhaps this isn't a huge surprise - after all, when I saw the film over the weekend, several Switch game trailers played before the movie began, including one for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.


Mario Kart 8: Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey and New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe all made the UK physical chart top 10 this week, with Mario Kart 8: Deluxe currently sitting at number two, only behind Fifa 23. This is a climb of two places for Nintendo's racer, which has seen a nine percent increase in sales week-on-week (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz)


As for the other two, Super Mario Odyssey jumped from tenth to fifth position this week, while New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe climbed from 17 to ten.

To evaluate these risks, we designed a test set comprising compounds from the DEA&#8217;s Schedule I and II substances and a list of known chemical weapon agents.

The "Automap" tool is a feature of the previous Diablo games. In Diablo 1 and 2 it appears as a faint overlay in the middle of the screen. Diablo 3 shifted the overlay map to the top right-hand corner of the screen, making it more of a mini-map.


Diablo 4, however, has a dedicated mini-map on the top-right corner of the screen, with the tab button used to display the full map and journal. The game will not have a tab overlay map as seen in Diablo 1 and 2, Diablo chief Rod Fergusson confirmed on Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those on base Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles will not be able to host a co-op session on Dead Island 2's release. Instead, they will have to rely on players with more recent consoles (from the same console family) to be the host. 


In a recent blog, developer Dambuster Studios stated that, due to Dead Island 2's graphic requirements, "the host must play on the latest generation console (PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X S) or one of the Generation 8+ consoles (PlayStation 4 Pro/Xbox One X)". The host can then be joined by up to two more players. 


As such, those on original PS4 and Xbox One consoles will not be able to host a session on the game's launch. The developer is working on a solution for this, with the plan being that everyone playing Dead Island 2 will eventually be able to host a session, regardless of console. Dambuster has not given a timeframe for this update as yet, merely stating it is planned to come "in the future".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser has been freed from prison, but will remain in debt to the company for the rest of his life.


In February 2022, Bowser was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices. He pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, plus an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo's own civil lawsuit against him.


Speaking to podcaster Nick Moses (via Kotaku), Bowser explained that Nintendo is now able to recoup 25-30 percent of his personal income for the rest of his working life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has tried to draw a line under the recent controversy surrounding a Destiny 2 community member accused of leaking upcoming game details.


In a fresh statement shared via Twitter, the studio stated it had "irrefutable evidence" including "video recordings, verified messages and images" regarding an individual who has leaked privileged information shared over the course of "multiple years". 


The issue first came to light last week, when Bungie said it had suffered a "breach of trust" after identifying a leaker amongst the small group of community members it sometimes invited to its studio to provide feedback on the game and share upcoming plans.
