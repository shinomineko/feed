Elite Dangerous' first SRV (that's Surface Recon Vehicle, in case you were wondering) arrived as part of the game's Horizons expansion back in 2015.

We initially got a taste of Sunbreak's moody new climes in September, when Capcom brought first news of the expansion. However, as part of this year's Game Awards, the publisher has traded pre-rendered cinematics for what appears to be in-engine footage. Granted, we're still talking cut-scenes here, but it's nice to get a more tangible look at the game as its release drawers slowly nearer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gears of War's Marcus Fenix and Kait Diaz are the latest characters to be uprooted from their usual homes and shoved into the metaversal nightmare that is Fortnite, with both arriving in the free-to-play battle royale game later today.
It's not entirely clear what the occasion is - although a quick Google tells me Gears of War is currently celebrating its 15 year, one month, and two day anniversary, so perhaps that's a thing - but Fenix and Diaz will both be available as paid skins in the Fortnite store from 7pm ET this evening, which equates to 12am, 10th December in the UK.

And if that's somehow not enough to be getting on with, leaks are suggesting Epic will have plenty more freebies to give away over the festive period.

Uemura worked alongside Gunpei Yokoi and Genyo Takeda on their early light gun games, before heading up Nintendo's first foray into home consoles with the Color-TV series that started in 1977.

With the release of Kubernetes v1.23, Pod Security admission has now entered beta. Pod Security is a built-in admission controller that evaluates pod specifications against a predefined set of Pod Security Standards and determines whether to admit or deny the pod from running.
Pod Security is the successor to PodSecurityPolicy which was deprecated in the v1.21 release, and will be removed in Kubernetes v1.25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a judge's ruling that Apple must allow developers the option of linking to external payment systems in their iOS apps as part of its lawsuit with Epic Games, an appeals court has permitted Apple to delay making the change until it's fully able to hear the case.
Back in September - following a lengthy court battle arising from Apple's decision to remove Fortnite from its App Store after Epic wilfully broke App Store guidelines by deliberately circumventing iOS' in-app payment mechanisms - California's Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruled against all but one of Epic's legal challenges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kratos is making the leap from PlayStation to PC early next year as 2018's acclaimed God of War heads to the platform - and in anticipation of its arrival, Sony has released a new trailer showing the PC version in action, alongside details of the enhancements it'll bring.
God of War 2018, if you're unfamiliar, reunites with Kratos some time after his reckoning with the gods of Olympus. It's all change as the game begins; not only has our protagonist gained a big bushy beard and slightly mellower demeanour in the interim (not to mention, got himself a son), he's swapped the opulence of Ancient Greece for colder climes, living a quieter life in the snow-ravaged realm of the Norse Gods.

Oh, and a new movie poster has been revealed too.
Sega first unveiled its new Sonic game during the hedgehog's special 30th birthday livestream back in May. The accompanying teaser trailer didn't offer much beyond a quick snatch of the iconic gaming mascot speeding through a forest, but a later press release named the game - planned to launch on Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2022 - as Sonic Rangers. However, Sega later retracted that name, claiming its inclusion was a mistake.

"When will Kubernetes have IPv6?" This question has been asked with increasing frequency ever since alpha support for IPv6 was first added in k8s v1.9. While Kubernetes has supported IPv6-only clusters since v1.18, migration from IPv4 to IPv6 was not yet possible at that point. At long last, dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 networking has reached general availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.23.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long time coming, but Halo's live-action TV adaptation will soon get a proper reveal, courtesy of its first full-length trailer airing at this week's Game Awards. Before all that though, there's the briefest of new teases to stoke a spot of anticipation and get you in the mood.
The live-action Halo series - which was first announced all the way back in 2013, at the height of Microsoft's infatuation with TV, TV, TV - got its first teaser trailer during November's Xbox Anniversary Celebration. It admittedly didn't show very much - Master Chief popped on his helmet, Cortana said hello - but it was just enough to get fans in the mood.

Ubisoft says the Anno team is "just getting started" on its latest DLC journey and so isn't quite ready to reveal specifics just yet. However, its blog post offers a few teases on the direction Seasons 4's three planned DLCs will be taking, with the focus this time around said being the New World - in contrast to the Old World focus of Season 3.

<blockquote><p>Since September 2021, officers have investigated five incidents where suspects have placed small tracking devices on high-end vehicles so they can later locate and steal them. Brand name &#8220;air tags&#8221; are placed in out-of-sight areas of the target vehicles when they are parked in public places like malls or parking lots. Thieves then track the targeted vehicles to the victim’s residence, where they are stolen from the driveway.</p>
<p>Thieves typically use tools like screwdrivers to enter the vehicles through the driver or passenger door, while ensuring not to set off alarms. Once inside, an electronic device, typically used by mechanics to reprogram the factory setting, is connected to the onboard diagnostics port below the dashboard and programs the vehicle to accept a key the thieves have brought with them. Once the new key is programmed, the vehicle will start and the thieves drive it away...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you weren't aware just yet, Gran Turismo 7 is all about delivering more of a classical Gran Turismo experience, after the more experimental multiplayer-focussed Gran Turismo Sport. Which probably explains why our best look at the game in action to date comes via the reveal of classic circuit Deep Forest, which PlayStation just served up a full in-game onboard playthrough. 
The fictional Deep Forest circuit made its debut alongside the Gran Turismo series way back in 1997, and has been a fan favourite ever since. Its appearance in Gran Turismo 7 is, perhaps unsurprisingly, its most impressive yet, and the lap onboard a GT Lamborghini shows a track that's at once visually outstanding while also being remarkably faithful to the PS1 original.

Zampella revealed EA's plans to create a multiple-game "connected Battlefield universe" in an interview with GameSpot, explaining it would feature an interconnected world with shared characters and stories, and "the player at the center". The aim of the move, Zampella claimed, is to "grow Battlefield and meet players where they play through various experiences and business models", including the upcoming Battlefield Mobile.

The Kubernetes release train rolls on, and we look ahead to the release of 1.23 next week. As is our tradition, I'm pleased to bring you a look back at the process that brought us the previous version.
The release team for 1.22 was led by Savitha Raghunathan, who was, at the time, a Senior Platform Engineer at MathWorks. I spoke to Savitha on the Kubernetes Podcast from Google, the weekly* show covering the Kubernetes and Cloud Native ecosystem.
Our release conversations shine a light on the team that puts together each Kubernetes release. Make sure you subscribe, wherever you get your podcasts so you catch the story of 1.23.

It's a piece of hardware that comes with a considerable cost, with the basic bundle that includes the direct drive hub, the bespoke GT rim and a two pedal setup coming in at 699.95EUR, running up to the premium bundle which includes a three-pedal setup and the Boost Kit 180 which increases the peak torque to 8nm.

Kubernetes v1.22, released in August 2021, introduced a new alpha feature that improves how Linux nodes implement memory resource requests and limits.
In prior releases, Kubernetes did not support memory quality guarantees.

      limits:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "500m"

spec.containers[].resources.requests(e.g. cpu, memory) is designed for scheduling. When you create a Pod, the Kubernetes scheduler selects a node for the Pod to run on. Each node has a maximum capacity for each of the resource types: the amount of CPU and memory it can…]]></summary>

Expeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are effectively No Man's Sky's stab at live-service-style seasonal content, offering limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the game's ever-expanding systems into a series of progression-based challenges - with various cosmetic rewards served up as different milestones are reached.

In an email seen by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier - and later confirmed by Microsoft in a statement to IGN - Spencer told Xbox employees he and the gaming leadership team were "disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions" at Activision Blizzard, and that "this type of behaviour has no place in our industry".

The official description for Hellblade's PC enhancements is a little vague, with Ninja Theory only promising "enriched visuals", alongside DirectX Raytracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and AMD FSR support. However, the new PC release will almost certainly reflect the Xbox Series X version, which introduced the likes of upgraded materials, particles, and draw distances.

Its arrival date has been revised to 8th February, a few weeks earlier than its originally anticipated 22nd February release.
Announcing the revised launch, Absolver explained it wanted to get Sifu into players hands a little sooner so they "can enjoy playing [it] ahead of an incredibly big month for highly anticipated AAA releases". If Sifu had stuck to its original release date it would have been jostling up against the likes of Destiny 2's The Witch Queen expansion, Horizon: Forbidden West, and the mighty Elden Ring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battlefield is used to a bit of chaos - it's at the series' core, after all, with manic moments in its sandbox what makes it stand out from other shooters - but the disarray of Battlefield 2042's first weekend in the wilds has been hugely frustrating. Since Battlefield 2042 went live on Friday, I've endured hard crashes, server problems and whole nights where the whole thing is simply unplayable. This is another Battlefield that's launching in a sorry state, and it's up there with Battlefield 4's infamously sorry start. From my own experience on Xbox Series X, it's considerably worse. 
A lot of that frustration stems from setting aside Friday night to get stuck into DICE's new shooter only to spend the whole evening butting up against a data persistent error that was, shall we say, persistent - across a whole night it was impossible to get into a single match of the All-Out Warfare that's the core of this new Battlefield experience, and only the classic matches and rulesets of Portal offered any joy.
