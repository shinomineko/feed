        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a little over a month to go until the release of PlayStation 5's spruced-up virtual reality kit, PSVR2, Sony has revealed the full 37-game launch window line-up players can expect to arrie between 22nd February and the end of March.


That list has steadily been growing since PSVR2's official unveiling late last year, and today brings news of 13 previously unannounced additions. These newcomers include GoodbyeWorld Games' Before Your Eyes - an "emotional" adventure in which players control the narrative through a world of memories by blinking - and Kayak VR: Mirage, giving players the opportunity to paddle through ice caves in Antarctica, accompany dolphins in Costa Rica, survive a thunderstorm in Norway, and roam canyons in Australia.


These are joined by Pavlov VR - which makes the jump from PC with "realistic weapon interactions and attachments", plus competitive and social game modes - plus Puzzling Places, a "relaxing and wholesome" 3D jigsaw puzzler featuring "hyper-realistic miniatures of beautiful places from around the globe."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New research suggests that warnings for games with loot box-style mechanics are inconsistent and unreliable.
Conducted by Leon Y Xiao in co-operation with universities in Denmark, London and the US, the study examines a randomised selection of smartphone games which have loot boxes and are available to download from the Google Play Store. The study aimed to find out how consistent loot box presence warnings are across PEGI and the ERSB, as well as the consistency of age ratings on the Google Play Store as overseen by the IARC.
In August last year, Xiao looked into the implementation of Belgium's loot box ban, and concluded that the country's legislation had proved ineffective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetEase staff have smashed up a giant World of Warcraft statue by their studio, as the ongoing and increasingly bitter dispute between it and Activision Blizzard continues.


Earlier this week, Activision Blizzard revealed it was now seeking a new Chinese publisher as its current deal with NetEase, its long-standing local operator in the country, concludes this month in a war of words - and now hammers. Controversially, Activision Blizzard claimed it had offered NetEase a six-month extension to its contract - and said it was a "pity" NetEase had not taken up its offer.

In response, staff at NetEase have seemingly made their feelings clear - by taking mallets to a large World of Warcraft sculpture and tearing it down, before sipping on NetEase-branded drinks. The event was even livestreamed on social media to some 30,000 people, according to a report by WOWHead.

"Riot Games implemented strategic shifts within a few teams to sharpen our focus in a number of areas. With these shifts, certain roles were eliminated, impacting a total of 46 Rioters.  This is part of our normal course of our business: We periodically make changes to our structure and our teams based on what we believe will allow us to deliver the best content and experiences for players," reads a statement from Riot to Eurogamer.
"We never make these decisions lightly and will always start from a place of wanting to retain Rioters and have them focus on our highest priorities. While that's not always possible, it's our primary goal."

Speaking to the LA Times, Straley addressed this snub from the showrunners, calling it an "argument for unionisation".

In a new post about the game's opening, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann stated the begining of The Last of Us was "one of the last things" the team finalised ahead of its release. This was because of these initial plans for you to play as Joel from the off.


The team ultimately decided this idea felt too similar to other games from the same genre, and it wanted to set The Last of Us apart from the rest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon are banned across a sizable swathe of Cyprus. There isn't a physical wall to keep them out - at least not in most areas. But in Pokémon Go a large area across the width of the Mediterranean island is still a Pokémon no-Go area, thanks to the country's past.


Before being contacted by Pokémon Go players based in Cyprus, I admit to being pretty ignorant of the island's recent history, and how its geography remains shaped by the after-effects of the country's 1974 Greek-backed coup and subsequent Turkish-led invasion. 


History lesson aside, the country remains divided by a United Nations Buffer Zone, a red ribbon on maps that cuts across the middle of the country. The internationally unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus lies to the north, while in the south sits the island's larger Greek Cypriot-dominated region. Between the two sits the Buffer Zone - an area which on paper sounds like a hazard, but in reality is home to 10,000 people - where Pokémon cannot spawn naturally.

However, there are some areas of the show that deviate slightly from Naughty Dog's original telling of Joel and Ellie's story. The most notable of these, which was announced ahead of the show's release, was that there would no longer be spores spreading the Cordyceps infection. 


Now, upcoming dialogue between Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie (shared as part of the BBC's audio review of the series) has revealed another way the virus can spread in the show. Please note, the below contains spoilers for The Last of Us.

Some players commemorated the occasion by livestreaming their final moments on the service which, although somewhat anticlimactic, marked the end of Stadia's short and troubled lifetime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former 343 Industries employees have taken to social media to criticise Microsoft following a round of layoffs.


Yesterday, 10,000 Microsoft employees lost their jobs, including staff at Bethesda Games Studios, Gears of War developer The Coalition, and Halo maker 343 Industries.



Patrick Wren, former senior multiplayer designer on Halo Infinite (and now working at Respawn on Jedi Survivor), was one such former employee who criticised the "incompetent leadership up top".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, developer Respawn published a blog post pulling the curtain back on Apex Legends skill-based matchmaking, or SBMM. In the blog post, technical director Samy Duc dives deep into the inner workings of the battle royale's matchmaking system, explaining in granular detail why players end up facing the players they do. It's a fascinating exploration of one of the key features of any competitive multiplayer game, and Apex Legends players have certainly enjoyed the transparency.


As a Call of Duty player, I couldn't help but look at Respawn's blog post and wish Activision would do something similar.


Call of Duty SBMM has been a topic of discussion for years, and with each new release in the series, the same vociferous back-and-forth emerges. I've reported on COD SBMM numerous times, usually when players get so disgruntled with it that they start to play the game in silly ways, such as deliberately losing in a bid to matchmake against lower-skilled players in subsequent lobbies. Activision has always taken a dim view of third-party websites and apps that let players try to game the system, too.

Additional bathroom clutter comes courtesy of The Sims 4's sensibly titled Bathroom Clutter Kit, which promises to embrace the "mess of daily life". It's not all about chaos though; EA says to expect everything from "cute wall decals for kids to grandma's dentures", with enough scope among its addition to create an "elegant retreat" as well as an untameable toiletry explosions.


"Whether you want to leave makeup and combs scattered on the counter or give your Sims some additional drawers to keep them tidy," it explains, "the choice is yours with this collection, featuring bathroom decor for all ages."

        <updated>2023-01-18T21:04:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has reportedly apologised for telling employees 'the ball was in their court' following disappointing financial results in the company's most recent quarter. However, senior management is also said to have rejected calls - highlighted in a recent union statement - for inflation-matching pay rises and a transition to a four-day week.


Guillemot's controversial comments to Ubisoft staff came in an email last week, when he wrote, "Today more than ever, I need your full energy and commitment to ensure we get back on the path to success. I am also asking that each of you be especially careful and strategic with your spending and initiatives, to ensure we're being as efficient and lean as possible. The ball is in your court to deliver this line-up on time and at the expected level of quality, and show everyone what we are capable of achieving."


Guillemot is said to have addressed his choice of words - which many saw as a shifting of blame for Ubisoft's recent troubles onto employees - during a company-wide Q&A session held earlier today, as reported by Kotaku citing sources present during the meeting.

To date, Thunderful has released five, radically different instalments in the celebrated SteamWorld series: SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig 1 & 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest. A sixth game, SteamWorld Headhunter, was announced in 2021.


Little is known about Headhunter, but the developer described it as a "stylised and colourful, third-person co-op action adventure" at the time of its unveiling, noting it would mark the SteamWorld series' first foray into the heady world of 3D.

PowerWash Simulator, if you're unfamiliar, arms players with assorted pumps, nozzles, and climbing equipment then sets them loose across a broad selection of scruffy environments in need of a good clean - from fire stations and treehouses to subterranean public loos. It's weirdly, wonderfully satisfying stuff, and surprisingly relaxing too.


PowerWash Simulator's incoming crossover, officially titled the Tomb Raider Special Pack, gives players access to five new levels in as part of a new mini-campaign, including a sprawling version of Croft Manor so utterly filthy, it's hard not to wonder what Lara's been up to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves is gearing up for a 2023 that'll see it celebrating five years of pirate adventure out on the waves, but before all that, it's hoisting anchor and setting sail with a mid-season update bringing pet rocks, a new limited-time adventure, and more.


Starting with that "and more", a major chunk of Sea of Thieves' new update - which arrives tomorrow, 19th January - is dedicated to improving the matchmaking system introduced as part of the game's new on-demand PvP functionality at the end of last year.


Eye-wateringly long wait times have been a major complaint since the feature's arrival in Season 8, and Rare is looking to remedy the issue by, firstly, allowing same-faction battles when matchmaking is taking to long. It's also introducing what it calls "cross-stamp migration" to make it easier for players to be paired. Some additional information on the changes can be found in a dev blog from December.

This interview resurfaced last night via Twitter, as translated by user gosokkyu, which has brought Takahashi's long-lost comments to light.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Marvel's Avengers are complaining over the latest addition to the game's paid-for premium skin collection: a Marvel Cinematic Universe-inspired Thor without his helmet on.


The issue? Marvel's Avengers already has a Marvel Cinematic Universe-inspired Thor with a helmet on, while this is being sold separately and for a relatively substantial amount of money. 


On his own, helmetless MCU Thor costs 1400 Credits (around $14), or comes at 500 Credits (around $5) if you already own the helmeted version (thanks, ComingSoon).

Of no real surprise, FIFA once again dominated in Europe, with FIFA 23 securing pole position on both consoles. Over in the US and Canada, however, big balls were swapped for big guns, as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 took the lead across both platforms.


God of War Ragnarök was also, unsurprisingly, a big winner on PlayStation 5, coming in as the third biggest download of 2022 in Europe (after Modern Warfare 2) and the second biggest download in the US/Canada. It was way down the PS4 list, however, scoring 9th place in the US/Canada and 15th place in Europe.

"For countless ages," says Paradox in a bout of scene-setting, "your people have looked to the stars with wonder - is there anybody else out there? When we meet, will they be friends or enemies? Will we be the ones to discover them, or are they already here, hiding in plain sight?".

Anno 1800's launch on current-gen systems will mark the first time in the series' 25-year history that a core instalment has been available on consoles, and strategy fans are in for a bit of a treat - it's a wonderfully rich city builder, tasking players with establishing a thriving logistical network between the Old and New Worlds of the 19th century in order to facilitate their expansion.


Console players that opt for Anno 1800's Standard edition gain access to everything in the base game, which includes a sizeable story campaign, sandbox, plus PvP and co-op modes. The console version also promises a reworked UI designed specifically for controller input, plus all free improvements and quality of life features released on PC over the last four years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Union workers at Ubisoft Paris have been called to strike in response to CEO Yves Guillemot's comments to employees that "the ball was in their court' following disappointing financial results in the company's most recent quarter.


"Today more than ever, I need your full energy and commitment to ensure we get back on the path to success," Guillemot wrote in an email to staff last week. "I am also asking that each of you be especially careful and strategic with your spending and initiatives, to ensure we're being as efficient and lean as possible. The ball is in your court to deliver this line-up on time and at the expected level of quality, and show everyone what we are capable of achieving."


In response to those comments, the Ubisoft Paris chapter of workers union Solidaires Informatique has now called for strike action on Friday, 27th January, writing, "The ball is in our court (but the money stays in his pocket)".

In the US, 4.7 million viewers tuned in for the series' first episode on Sunday, Deadline reported. We're still waiting to hear word from UK broadcast partner Sky Atlantic for viewing figures here. 


How does that compare? Putting House of the Dragon aside for a moment, The Last of Us is HBO's biggest non-Game of Thrones launch since 2010's Boardwalk Empire, which managed 4.81 million viewers - only slightly more.

For the PS5 demo, "various technical issues" have been fixed including locked-on enemies that move off-screen and lose their locked-on status. The demo will also get button mapping functionality, and has had some of its text sizes adjusted. 


On PC, fans now have a set of meaty technical specifications to hit if they want to play Forspoken on its Ultra settings: an Nvidia GeForce 4080 or AMD Radeon 6800 with 32GB memory, for 2160p and 60fps. Further details are given in the below PC trailer.

The FBI also found what specific pages Al-Azhari visited, including a section on donating Bitcoin; another focused on military operations conducted by ISIS fighters in Iraq, Syria, and Nigeria; and another page that provided links to material from ISIS’s media arm. Without the FBI deploying some form of surveillance technique, or Al-Azhari using another method to visit the site which exposed their IP address, this should not have been possible...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Now, Activision Blizzard subsidiary Blizzard China has claimed it offered a six month extension to NetEase, while it spent time looking for a new long-term partner. 


Blizzard China revealed the claim today on social media site Weibo, news agency Reuters has reported. There's no detail on Activision Blizzard's ongoing search for a new Chinese partner, or word on how or when its games might return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long old wait, but HBO's live-action TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us is finally here - and, following this weekend's barnstorming premiere episode, HBO has teased some of the horrors to come in its latest trailer.


Prior to The Last of Us' TV premiere, early word from critics was extremely positive, giving fans of the games plenty to get excited about - and the first episode suggested the hype was well-earned, introducing a stellar cast and expanding on the source material's opening hour or so in largely effective, impactful ways.


With the groundwork now laid, Ellie and Joel's unforgettable road trip across a post-apocalyptic United States can begin in earnest - which, given the opening episode's surprisingly close adherence to the source material, will almost certainly see plenty of fan-favourite moments getting the live-action treatment as the weeks go on. And HBO has now offered a small tease of the events still to come in its latest trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, an unannounced new title from Riot Games' Riot Forge label, has been leaked by the South Korean ratings board.


As spotted by Gematsu, the now-pulled Game Rating and Administration Committee listing described Mageseeker as an "action game for PC" that casts players in the role of League of Legends champion Sylas, who joined the hugely popular MOBA's line-up in 2019.


Here's how Riot describes Sylas in his official biography: "Raised in one of Demacia's lesser quarters, Sylas of Dregbourne has come to symbolise the darker side of the Great City. As a boy, his ability to root out hidden sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers, who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers against them. Having now broken free, Sylas lives as a hardened revolutionary, using the magic of those around him to destroy the kingdom he once served...and his band of outcast mage followers seems to grow by the day."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retro spruce-up The House of the Dead: Remake is heading to PlayStation 5 this Friday, 20th January, promising "adjusted" graphics and performance.


Developed by Forever Entertainment and MegaPixel Studio, which previously collaborated on the similar Panzer Dragoon remake, House of the Dead: Remake is an updated version of Sega's beloved 1997 arcade rail-shooter, giving the original's zombie blasting action a fresh lick of modern-day paint.


Most obvious are the graphical enhancements, but House of the Dead: Remake also features new audio, updated controls (light guns are regrettably not standard on modern consoles), a new Horde mode that increases the on-screen enemy count, a photo mode, gallery, leaderboards, and achievements. There's also support for local two-player co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Valheim's long-awaited Mistlands biome finally here, developer Iron Gate Studio has opened up a little about what's next, sharing initial plans for the acclaimed early access viking survival game next biome, the Ashlands, in its latest blog update.


Taking the same unapologetically literal approach to naming that saw Valheim's new mist-shrouded biome become the Mistlands, the Ashlands will whisk players away to a land of ash, where the dead roam a landscape marked by volcanic activity.


While Valheim's Ashlands technically already exist in-game - albeit in temporary and extremely rudimentary form - their full development will usher in a radical overhaul, introducing a biome that Iron Gate says will be "quite different" from existing ones, serving up a "large chunk of land at the far south of the map, rather than small islands spread out over the world."

He became protective of me, constantly under my feet or curling up across my lap as soon as I sat down. He would not leave my side, and I did not understand why.


Soon enough, it all became clear. I was having a baby. Needless to say, I was surprised. But my dog was not. He knew. He had always known. Animals have a sense for these things. Which is why, when a dog started to become uneasy around a seemingly harmless lady in HBO's The Last of Us, I knew straight away something was amiss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Max Verstappen has called this year's 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual 'a clown show' after the high-profile sim racing event once again suffered server issues that saw two red flags that stopped racing and numerous disconnects that took teams out of contention - including reigning F1 world champion Verstappen's Team Redline, whose retirement inspired a polemic aimed towards the organisers Motorsport Games and the rFactor 2 platform on which the event was hosted. 


This weekend saw the third running of what's widely regarded as the biggest event in sim racing, with the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual attracting stars such as Verstappen and other real-world racers like Romain Grosjean and Felipe Drugovich. It's an impeccably presented thing with a team led by experienced motorsport commentators like Martin Haven and Ben Constanduros. 


Unfortunately this year's edition was once again plagued by connection issues with the rFactor 2 platform that's owned by Motorsport Games unable to host a 24 hour event with stability, with server issues forcing two red flags in the first seven hours of the event. The server issues were later revealed to be caused by participants inadvertently sharing IP addresses with the public.

Three unannounced Ubisoft games were canned last week, on top of the four ditched last July. These latest cancellations follow a round of poor financial results and concern over the company's future portfolio - something which has also battered Ubisoft's stock price. 


Ubisoft's statement on the matter admitted it would continue on with "increased cautiousness over the coming years" as the games industry shifts towards "mega-brands and long-lasting titles" - something which raised questions as to where Beyond Good & Evil 2 fitted in.

Insider Gaming says the information set to be shared that night will be embargoed until the end of the month "to allow for travel and content development", so expect more then. Further information not available at the San Antonio event is rumoured to be coming on 1st February, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news, Simpsons fans - the full soundtrack from The Simpsons Hit & Run is now available on Spotify and Apple Music.

Interestingly enough, it seems as though the soundtracks have been available to stream since September last year, but it's only now fans have noticed the cult game's OST sitting between other fan-favourite soundtracks, including Go Simpsonic with the Simpsons, Songs in the Key of Springfield, and Testify. 

No-one's entirely sure why Disney has made the soundtracks available without a formal announcement, but hey, we're not complaining.

The two "exclusive WWE cosmetic bundles" feature the likeness of Undertake and Becky "The Man" Lynch, and are available now on all platforms where you can play Siege, including PC, current-gen consoles, last-gen consoles, and Ubisoft's subscription service, Ubisoft+.

The Deadman Bundle for Blackbeard, unsurprisingly given its name, includes the Undertaker uniform, special headgear, an Operator portrait, and a Undertaker Championship charm. You'll also get the Moonlight Brawl background and a new skin for the MK17 CQB called The Tombstone.

The issue came to light when thousands of players flocked to Steam to lodge negative user reviews, dropping the "mostly positive" aggregate rating to "mostly negative". Many state that the message they received said "Ban (inactivity)" with no other reason given for their removal from the game.

In a brief blog post shared over the weekend, the developer said that an error had "triggered these false bans" and vows it will "make this right with affected players".

Whilst we already knew it was selling by the bucketload, NPD has now released December's top selling chart, confirming that Modern Warfare 2 managed to hold on to pole position and finishes the year as the US' best-selling game.

God of War: Ragnarok released in time to secure a position on 2022's Top Ten best-selling games, clocking in at number four behind Madden NFL 23, which took third place. The silver goes to Elden Ring, which held the top spot all year until Modern Warfare 2 came along and kicked it off its perch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Striking Distance Studios' debut game, The Callisto Protocol, has reportedly failed to hit its sales targets, forcing Krafton's investors to "lower their target stock prices".

That's according to a translated article from Korean site MK Odyssey, which says the action horror - which cost 200 billion won (£132m / $161.5m) to make over three years - has affected parent company Krafton's value "due to sales shortages".        

According to Samsung Securities, Krafton expected to shift five million copies of The Callisto Protocol, but with just two million copies sold thus far, the stockbroker now thinks it "will not be easy" to hit that milestone.

A new behind-the-scenes video focuses on the motion-capture process, and we're also given a peek at the new single Tragic from Remains, a companion album to the game's official soundtrack.                                                                                                                                                                                        

"Shot on location at The House of Moves in Los Angeles, the video diary gives horror fans a fascinating window into the method of mo-cap, illustrating some of the key choreography and physical performance that goes into animating character movements," Gun explains.

<blockquote><p>Author and public-interest security technologist Schneier (<em>Data and Goliath</em>, 2015) defines a “hack” as an activity allowed by a system “that subverts the rules or norms of the system [&#8230;] at the expense of someone else affected by the system.” In accessing the security of a particular system, technologists such as Schneier look at how it might fail. In order to counter a hack, it becomes necessary to think like a hacker. Schneier lays out the ramifications of a variety of hacks, contrasting the hacking of the tax code to benefit the wealthy with hacks in realms such as sports that can innovate and change a game for the better. The key to dealing with hacks is being proactive and providing adequate patches to fix any vulnerabilities. Schneier’s fascinating work illustrates how susceptible many systems are to being hacked and how lives can be altered by these subversions. Schneier’s deep dive into this cross-section of technology and humanity makes for investigative gold...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following this week's announcement of yet another delay for Skull and Bones, Ubisoft has shared 30 minutes of new footage from its beleaguered pirate adventure, focusing on what it calls the game's "narrative gameplay".


It's perhaps something of an unexpected place to return after a lengthy absence, given Ubisoft insisted Skull and Bones was "not a narrative-driven game" last summer, but it does at least give players a better idea of how the publisher is attempting to inject a bit of variety into the action.


As Ubisoft explained last year, Skull and Bones is overwhelmingly focused on sailing and combat, with players only able to disembark their ships and explore dry land at a limited number of locations, defined as outposts. Functionally, outposts serve as places players can trade, cash in contracts, pay off factions, and meet other players - but, as detailed in Ubisoft's latest gameplay devstream, they're also locations where they might find narrative content Ubisoft is calling "investigations".

This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07321.pdf">paper</a> is a good survey of the field: what the threats are, how we might detect machine-generated text, directions for future research.

<blockquote><p>Machine Generated Text: A Comprehensive Survey of Threat Models and Detection Methods</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Advances in natural language generation (NLG) have resulted in machine generated text that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human authored text. Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and  accountability...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The Halloween helmer has previously spoken of his interest in making a Dead Space film - and has now said that a project to get the survival horror franchise on the big screen is now in progress, albeit not with him attached.


"I'm a big video game fan, so I played all the games," Carpenter told Variety. "I was down looking at the new digital cameras, the RED, and happened to mention to them that I would love to do a Dead Space film. That just went around, and everybody said, 'Oh, when are you gonna do it?'"

Last night, upset at expected changes in the updated OGL resulted in a widely-shared push by D&D fans and streamers to ditch the game's online subscription, D&D Beyond. 


Gizmodo, which initially published details of the updated OGL last week, subsequently reported that this latest backlash has prompted Wizards of the Coast to cancel its plans to formally announce the changes for the time being, leaving the company's upper management in a "scramble to adjust their messaging around the situation".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus has released its streaming guidelines for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden and won't be restricting content.



Players are free to stream both games but the publisher requests players mark story sections with spoiler warnings.


This is good news for fans of the series, considering Atlus was particularly tight with its Persona 5 streaming guidelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google and Nvidia have contacted US financial regulators about Microsoft's proposed $69bn takeover of Activision Blizzard, according to Bloomberg (paywall).


Sources told the website both Google and Nvidia had "expressed concerns" to the Federal Trade Commision (FTC), which sued to block the deal in December.


The FTC has argued the buyout, which would grant Microsoft ownership of the likes of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, would reduce competition in the industry - a claim Microsoft has strongly denied. A trial is set for August.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft will reveal Skull and Bones' new release date "very soon", the publisher has said, following yesterday's news of a further delay for the beleaguered pirate adventure.


Skull and Bones, which has been in development since 2013, was revealed in 2017 but has faced repeated delays since then, its release most recently being moved from November 2022 to March 2023. Yesterday though, Ubisoft confirmed it was pushing the troubled game's launch back yet again, this time to "early" in the fiscal year 2023-24.


In a follow-up statement shared by the official Skull and Bones Twitter account, Ubisoft spoke a little more about the delay, saying its "determination and focus remain the same - offer the best in-game experience possible to our play from day 1".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Justin Roiland - the co-creator of Rick and Morty, and head of High on Life studio Squanch Games - has been charged with domestic violence in relation to a 2020 incident.


That's according to NBC News, which obtained a copy of the criminal complaint filed against Roiland through the Orange County Superior Court, charging him with "one felony count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud and/or deceit".


The complaint relates to an incident which took place on or around 19th January 2020, involving "an anonymous Jane Doe who was dating Roiland at the time." Roiland is said to have been charged in May 2020 then arrested and released on a $50,000 USD bond in August of the same year. He was then arraigned in October 2020 and pleaded not guilty to both charges.

Launched in 2016, GOG Connect was a neat proposition on paper, allowing users to link their GOG and Steam accounts and then get a duplicate, DRM-free version of a game they'd already purchased on Valve's platform over on GOG.


In practice, though, it was all a bit restrictive, with GOG only offering a very limited selection of eligible games - and even those could only be added to a user's GOG library within a very strict timeframe for contractual reasons. Perhaps unsurprisingly, support for the service slowly dwindled and GOG Connect has now been inactive (if not officially dead) for years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a bit of an irresistable deal for point-and-click adventure fans: you can currently get 13 titles from publisher and developer Wadjet Eye Games' library of superb point-and-click adventures for just £8, courtesy of Humble Bundle.


Wadjet Eye, if you're unfamiliar, has been releasing highly acclaimed, old-school-inspired point-and-click adventures - complete with some gorgeous pixel art - since 2006. The studio's earliest titles - namely Shivah, which explores themes around the Jewish faith, and the entire Blackwell supernatural detective series - are all present and correct in Humble's latest bundle.


And it continues, serving up some real gems as the bundle shifts through sci-fi - in Resonance, TechnoBabylon, and Gemini Rue - to post-apocalyptic nightmare in Shardlight and Promordia to something altogether weirder with Wormwood Studios' acclaimed Strangeland, in which a man must unravel his past while exploring a terrifyingly surreal carnival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello and welcome back to the Eurogamer Newscast! We're already almost halfway through January 2023 and the video games industry is stirring. There are huge games on the horizon and plenty to look forward to - and look forward we will. 

2023 promises to be a stellar year for video games, full of proper current-gen console exclusives, awesome indies and more than a few titles held up from last year (and the year before). The next 12 months should see all of these and more splurge out onto the scene for you to try. But where to start? 
Joining me to pick out our highlights for the year are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan - and there's some surprising picks in there, as well as Pikmin 4! Apparently some new Final Fantasy game is coming out too, and Zelda's up to something. Beyond video games themselves, there's also The Last of Us TV show to look forward to - that's out next week! - and hopefully some recommendations from us for some lesser-known gems also waiting in the wings. Thanks for watching!

Now, I know what you are thinking: "Victoria, why would you care about this? You would have been a newborn when this cartoon was playing on TV and therefore have no idea what was happening. You were probably just learning what your hand was or experiencing mashed potatoes for the first time."


This is very true. I was. But I'm also a huge Legend of Zelda fan, and that means as soon as I was aware of the existence of the Zelda cartoon, I tracked it down and watched it for myself. And then, when I had children of my own, I watched it again with them on YouTube. It was a family affair and, as it turns out, having this series become a bit of an ongoing family affair was also a theme during the cartoon's conception. How's that for a segue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 developer Bungie has announced a major change for the game's selection of armour mods, which - as you might expect - allow you to modify your character's abilities.


Beginning now, all "standard" armour mods have been unlocked for all players - a move Bungie says is designed to allow "everyone a chance to enjoy all mods in their current state" ahead of the upcoming Lightfall expansion, which will feature "big changes" to buildcrafting. 


It's an interesting move which will allow players far more freedom to experiment with armour mods to find the setup that best suits their playstyle - without relying on the random chances of particular mods turning up for sale via Ada-1's in-game shop.

Kubernetes has been widely adopted, and many organizations use it as their de-facto orchestration engine for running workloads that need to be created and deleted frequently.
Therefore, proper scheduling of the pods is key to ensuring that application pods are up and running within the Kubernetes cluster without any issues. This article delves into the use cases around resource management by leveraging the PriorityClass object to protect mission-critical or high-priority pods from getting evicted and making sure that the application pods are up, running, and serving traffic.

Piranha Games president Russ Bullock shared the news during an interview with the NoGutsNoGalaxy podcast (thanks PC Gamer), teasing, "I'll just say that it's not MechWarrior Online 2, it's not the successor to MechWarrior Online, it's not an online PvP [game] - think of it more in line with MechWarrior 5, but a standalone game, a standalone product."


According to Bullock, the currently mysterious title - which is being developed for PC and consoles - follows "more of a single-player co-op type of pathway". Beyond that, though, details are thin, and a full reveal may not happen until this autumn.

Announcing the news, Ubisoft said it was facing "major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles", compounded by the underperformance of recent launches including Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023.


Ubisoft says the resulting financial pressures have triggered a full review of its revenue prospects, leading to an "increased cautiousness over the coming years". As a result it has decided to cancel three unannounced projects, on top of the four games cancelled last July.

Acclaimed supernatural narrative adventure series Life is Strange is actually joining the PlayStation Plus catalogue with two instalments - developer Dontnod's initial episodic adventure and Deck Nine's prequel Before the Storm, which follows the adventures of Chloe Price before she met the first game's protagonist Max Caulfield.

The feature will be available for Xbox Insiders using the energy saving shutdown power option and with their console configured to support automatic updates.


From today, Insiders will also have their Xbox Series X/S console automatically update to the shutdown option, which reduces power consumption while the console is switched off.

This does, admittedly, make for a rather unsociable hour to be up. If you are in Blighty, it will mean watching the show at 2am. 


However, if you are anything like me and a big fan of The Last of Us, this show may well make the eye bags and inevitable reliance on intravenous coffee to get you through the rest of the next day worthwhile.

Scourge and Plague (1500 V-Bucks each) returned to Fortnite's infamous rotating item shop at midnight last night, after an absence of 1080 days. Both are styled after the beaked physicians seen in the 16th and 17th centuries who treated bubonic plague victims.


Originally released in late 2018, the skins formed a regular and popular set which went on sale every couple of months - until their last appearance at the end of January 2020. At the time, I remember their spotlight in the item shop raising eyebrows, as the early stages of the Covid pandemic were already dominating global news.

These changes, which were first laid out by YouTube in November, state the platform's "approach to profanity is changing" (thanks, Kotaku).


Now, all profanities are "treated equally" across the site, meaning words like 'crap' carry the same weight as 'fuck' as far as inappropriate language use goes (the site has, however, eased its stance on both "hell" and "damn" - these words are no longer classed as profanities and can be used more freely).

The phenomenon of using machine learning to teach an AI program how to play Rocket League is nothing new, as this PC Gamer report delves into. Trained bots have been pitted against each other for a while in local matches, and the question of how much and how well an AI program can learn to play a game like Rocket League is an interesting one to answer.


The problem comes with the seemingly more recent discovery by players that versions of the game's AI-trained Nexto bot are now being used to cheat in Rocket League's competitive ranked play modes, disguised as human players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're less than a week away from the highly anticipated debut of HBO's live-action The Last of Us TV adaptation and early reviews from critics are positively glowing, with the series currently enjoying a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes across more than 40 reviews at the time of writing.


First announced back in 2020, HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation has been written and created by Chernobyl's Craig Mazin, alongside Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann. It stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, with other notable cast members including Nick Offerman in the role of Bill, Jeffrey Pierce (who played Joel's brother Tommy in the Last of Us video games) as quarantine zone rebel Perry, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge, who reprises her video game role of Marlene, the leader of the Fireflies resistance.


The last few months have seen HBO's PR machine crank into top gear as The Last of Us' January release approaches, with December bringing the show's second full-length trailer. Now, though, some lucky professional critics have had the chance to watch the entirety of the show's first season, and - despite some notable changes to the source material - the praise is effusive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK government has passed a law mandating new homes in England must be built with "lightning-fast" gigabit-capable broadband connections.


Gigabit broadband - that is, broadband capable of download speeds of at least 1 gigabit-per-second - is currently available in over 72% of the UK, according to the government's figures. However, a new law, in effect since December, aims to increases that percentage further by making it a legal requirement that new homes are fitted with infrastructure and connections capable of delivering gigabit broadband.


"The updated regulations mean that more people moving into new homes will have a gigabit-capable broadband connection ready when construction is completed," the government explained, "avoiding the need for costly and disruptive installation work after the home is built and enabling residents to arrange the best possible internet service at the point they move in."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're at all curious about One Piece Odyssey - the latest limb-stretching video game adventure for Monkey D. Luffy and friends - Namco Bandai has you covered, with a demo now available on Xbox and PlayStation ahead of this Friday's release.


One Piece Odyssey unfolds on a mysterious island discovered by the Straw Hats pirate gang after their ship is caught in a storm. The ensuing action takes the form of an RPG, with open-world exploration punctuated by turn-based battles and dungeons - with each of the game's playable characters able to use their unique abilities in variety of situations, including battles, traversal, and puzzle solving.


Playable characters include Luffy, Zoro, Sani, Usopp, and Nami, with the likes of Portgas D. Ace and Trafalgar Law putting in an appearance as supporting characters that can fight alongside the core crew. In story terms, that's possible thanks to Memoria - a realm made of the Straw Hats' memories, which they'll need to explore to retrieve their lost abilities.

The Shockwave Hammer, introduced last month alongside the game's bumper Chapter 4 revamp, was  disabled yesterday in several of Fortnite's competitive modes as a glitch which allowed players to repeatedly spam the item became rampant. 


Players have taken to social media over the past week to brand the game as "unplayable" after the glitch's use spread - allowing players to jump around the map non-stop, without the item's usual cooldown.

The latter volume was produced in partnership with Sega, but despite Bitmap Books' efforts, its planned Mega Drive Visual Compendium didn't have the official backing of the company, ultimately leading to its demise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse, the third and regrettably final season of Telltale Games' episodic point-and-click adventure series, will be getting the remaster treatment in 2023 courtesy of developer Skunkape Games.


The Devil's Playhouse, which initially released all the way back in 2010, features yet more anarchic escapades from cult comic book artist Steve Purcell's crime-fighting dog and bunny duo Sam & Max, this time pitting the pair against Eldritch gods, alien warlords, and more in a battle to control an ancient, otherworldly power.


Skunkape hasn't said much too much about The Devil's Playhouse Remastered beyond confirmation it'll launch later this year, but it seems reasonable to expect the same kind of attention seen in the developer's previous Sam & Max remasters - Save the World and Beyond Time and Space - which featured the likes of enhanced graphics and audio, dynamic lighting, improved lip syncing, a new user interface, controller support, and more.

That's according to Windows Central's Jez Corden, who claims the showcase - reportedly titled Xbox Developer_Direct - will air on Wednesday, 25th January at 12pm PT/8pm in the UK.


Citing a "variety of sources familiar with Microsoft's plans", Corden says the showcase will focus on content from Xbox and Bethesda, offering an "intimate" look at "major" first-party titles for 2023. These will reportedly include Arkane's delayed Redfall, Turn 10 Studios' latest Forza Motorsport, Mojang's action-strategy spin-off Minecraft Legends, and unspecified "content" from content from ZeniMax Online Studios.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're mere weeks away from the release of EA Motive's extremely promising remake of sci-fi horror classic Dead Space, and to sweeten the deal for those considering a pre-order, EA is bundling in a copy of the original Dead Space 2 on Steam.


EA Motive's Dead Space remake - which launches for PC and current-gen consoles on 27th January - is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games' much-loved 2008 original, reimagining engineer Isaac Clarke's terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura with enhanced audio and visuals, gameplay refinements, and more.


As spotted by VG247, players that pre-order the remake on Steam will now get a nifty bonus in the form of 2011's Dead Space 2, meaning they can dive straight into the Isaac's continuing story when the credits roll. Despite its age, Dead Space 2 ordinarily costs £17.99 on Steam, so that's a decent saving for anyone who's yet to experience the well-regarded sequel.

However, over the weekend a fairly big change came to light - in HBO's take on the series, the Cordyceps infection will not be spread by spores in the air. Rather, it will be able to spread by "tendrils" that can become a "network that is interconnected".


During an interview with Collider, co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin spoke more about pandemics generally, and how the infection would be depicted in the show.

The games keeping us busy this weekend? As is usually the case, the top two are CS:GO and Dota 2, but Among Us clone Goose Goose Duck jumps in to take the bronze. PUBG, Apex Legends, Lost Ark, GTA 5, Rust, Modern Warfare 2, and Wallpaper Engine round out the top ten respectively.

Last year, the remake's producer said that upcoming remake of cult classic Lollipop Chainsaw will not make broad changes to the story or design of the original game, and that includes any potential changes to the look of its main character, cheerleader Juliet.

Courtesy of a celebratory New Year's tweet, it looks like the team has been true to its word. Although it's only the tiniest glimpse, we've finally got our first look at the new-look Juliet, who's still slashing through hordes of zombies rocking a skimpy outfit, which you can see below:

The announcement was made as part of a PlayStation blog post rounding up a raft of indie games coming to the consoles.


We're big fans of FuturLab's Powerwash Simulator here at Eurogamer, and have written about it extensively. You clean dirt off stuff, essentially. It's satisfying, therapeutic and weirdly tricky at times. You can even go prone like an MLG powerwash pro to get right under those hard to reach bits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an inglorious end to his career at Manchester United and, perhaps, his national team Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo has left elite level football for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr and a contract reportedly worth up to €200m (£177m) a year. And with the move comes an inevitable - some would say long overdue - FIFA rating downgrade.


37-year-old Ronaldo, who for years had been one of the two best cards in the FIFA games alongside World Cup winner Lionel Messi, had already dropped three positions for the FIFA 23 top 10 with a 90-rated card. Now, after Ronaldo's poor performance at the World Cup and his move to the Saudi Pro League, EA has knocked Ronaldo down a further peg to his lowest rating since 2007, when the forward broke through at Manchester United.


Ronaldo's overall rating is now 88, two lower than the 90 he started FIFA 23 with back in September. Crucially, his specific stats are also lower. His dribbling, for example, is down to 81 from 84, his stamina down to 70 from 74.

Bay 12 Games' famously impenetrable simulation game launched on Steam on 6th December in spruced up form, with actual graphics as opposed to the text or "ASCII" graphics of the original version.


In a forum post, programmer and co-designer Tarn Adams declared Dwarf Fortress' Steam launch, which came after 16 years of free availability, a "wild success". Dwarf Fortress is also sitting on an "overwhelmingly positive" user review rating on Steam.

The game was released in a notoriously buggy state, particularly on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which led to a complaint filed in December 2020 that alleged the developer misled both customers and investors on how playable the game was.



Now, a federal judge in California has signed off on the settlement (thanks ArsTechnica), where everybody who acquired publicly traded CDPR shares throughout most of 2020 is eligible for settlement funds at roughly $0.49 per eligible share.

Asked about the extent the studio was given free reign by Konami to transform the game with its own vision, Jasińska said: "We are focusing on bringing the distinct, visceral atmosphere back in the modernised Silent Hill 2. Longtime fans shouldn’t worry about us 'missing the point' while we’re livening up the title. We faithfully stick to the traditional story canon while remaking the gameplay and updating the graphics from the ground up."

Mortal Shell is a Dark-Souls inspired action RPG from Cold Symmetry, with the developer stating it will "test your sanity and resilience".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't seen or heard much about Fntastic's upcoming zombie MMO The Day Before for a while now. However, with its release date tiptoeing ever closer (1st March on PC), the developer has debuted some new gameplay. 


Shared as part of CES 2023, this trailer shows off the game with Nvidia's latest ray tracing tech in play. It's a bite-sized little teaser that begins with a few sweeping shots showing the destruction and destitution left in The Day Before's version of a post-pandemic America. 


It then cuts to scenes of the player character shooting down their enemies, engaging in stealthy trips into darkened rooms and along questionable corridors, and, of course, a swarming zombie horde. You can see it for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti graphics card goes on sale today, offering largely RTX 3090 to 3090 Ti level performance at $799 in the US and £799 in the UK. That's the narrative, anyway - but how many cards will actually be available at the MSRP/RRP? 
It's an important question, because as the old saying goes, there are no bad products, just bad prices. The RTX 4070 Ti is quite a strong option at $799, given its level of performance - particularly for those upgrading from Pascal (GTX 10-series) and Turing (20-series) GPUs or AMD's equivalents. At $899 or $999 though, this graphics card starts to make much less sense. 
And with no Founders Edition cards available, we're relying on third-party GPU makers to create SKUs that meet that price point - when it would be much more profitable for them to offer overclocked designs with oversized coolers and RGB bling for $50, $100 or $200 more. In fact, it's these sorts of cards that seem to have been sent out for review, including our unit which offered a paltry 30MHz overclock over stock - but came with a higher price tag to match.

The $7.7m lawsuit was filed last year due to a number of false copyright takedowns sent to Destiny 2 players in March. In June the perpetrator was identified as Nicholas Minor a.k.a Lord Nazo.




At the time, Bungie alleged that Minor launched a "malicious campaign to serve fraudulent takedown notices to some of the most prominent and passionate members of that fanbase, purportedly on Bungie's behalf, in apparent retaliation for Bungie enforcing its copyrights against material Minor uploaded to his own YouTube channel".

Smaller clubs like Wrexham aren't normally featured in FIFA, but the club entered the game in FIFA 22 in the "Rest of the World" category, likely due to the novelty of Reynolds and McElhenney being the new owners. 


Wrexham then returned for FIFA 23, only this time, players have found some trash talk from Reynolds and McElhenney from the benches.

This update (spotted by PC Gamer) includes catchy renditions of Rule Britannia, working trains, and - checks notes - murderous mail worker bots known as Post Boxers that will "stamp you out" if you do them wrong. Huh.


This latest update video is truly a sight to behold. Along with the Post Boxers, it also introduces us to another bot out for our blood - the Naval Walker. This is a sentient (in so much as it walks around at its own free will) mine that will chase you down. There are different types of these walkers throughout the mod, with the paint on each denoting which kind you are dealing with.

        <updated>2023-01-05T12:18:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD has announced a raft of new Ryzen processors at its CES 2023 showcase, including the long-awaited Ryzen 7000X3D processors that should provide a stern rejoinder to Intel's 13th-gen desktop CPUs and could let Team Red reclaim the gaming performance crown. 
The idea here is pretty simple: take the '3D V-Cache' technology that made AMD's last-gen Ryzen 7 5800X3D so fast that it challenged even next-gen flagship CPUs, and pair it with some of AMD's fastest Ryzen 7000 processors. The result is three new chips, the Ryzen 7800X3D, Ryzen 7900X3D and the Ryzen 7950X3D. All three come with dramatically increased cache sizes - 104MB of L2 and L3 cache on the Ryzen 7 and up to 144MB on the Ryzen 9 - which minimise the time CPUs spend waiting for data to be copied into the cache, increasing performance considerably in some games. 
In AMD-provided benchmarks, the 7800X3D was between 10 and 25 percent faster than the 5800X3D at 1080p in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Borderlands 3 and F1 22 - slightly less than I would have expected, given that the 7800X3D is also using DDR5 RAM versus the DDR4 on the 5800X3D. Perhaps a more interesting comparison is that of the 7950X3D against the 13900K, where AMD showed between a nine and 24 percent performance lead in Watchdogs Legion, Dota 2, Rainbow Six Siege and Horizon Zero Dawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you who, like me, are quite partial to a live action video game adaptation, I am pleased to tell you we have been given a new look at Sony's upcoming Gran Turismo film.


This trailer covers a few behind the scenes shots that give us a closer look at how the film was made - things like cars rigged up with cameras left, right and centre. It also has some quotes from the film's actors, including Pirates of the Caribbean and Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom who has promised us all "body vibrating sound" that will mean viewers will feel "every jolt [and] every thrill" of the race on the film's release (which will be exclusively in theatres). 


Not that this film is going to solely focus on the cars, however. The cast has said there will be "heart-pounding action, drama [and] a love story" also woven into the script, that follows the true story of Jann Mardenborough.

Racing games are a natural fit for virtual reality - it's been my preferred way to play ever since it became a viable option - and Gran Turismo 7 follows in the footsteps of Gran Turismo Sport which was supported by the original PSVR headset.


PlayStation VR2 is coming out on February 22nd, with units costing a cool £530. Here's everything you need to know about PSVR2, including its launch titles and full specs - and it's a device that Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton has been very enthusiastic about since trying it for himself.

The v1.25 release of Kubernetes introduced an alpha feature to change how a default StorageClass was assigned to a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
With the feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and PVC second to assign the class. Additionally, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned can be updated later.
This feature was graduated to beta in Kubernetes 1.26.
You can read retroactive default StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation for more details about how to use that,

Along with Pedro Pascal's Joel, we will see all the highs and lows these two characters go through on their perilous journey across America when the show makes its debut later this month. 


However, it turns out that before Ramsey landed the part of Ellie, fellow Game of Thrones alum Maisie Williams (who played Arya Stark) was in talks for the role back when the game was being pegged for a film adaptation.


Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann said the team needed to ensure that whoever was cast as Ellie in any adaptation would be able to appear "tough and vulnerable and wise beyond [their] years and also have a potential for violence" all at once.

This new image shows an abandoned cruise liner that, along with the rest of the world, has succumbed to the weather and decay of time. Its windows have been smashed, its hull has rusted - a far cry from its presumably once luxurious state. 


Along with this artwork, which you can see in full below, Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann stated the studio's upcoming multiplayer project is "shaping up to be a fresh, new experience". But while it may be fresh and new, Druckmann has said it will still be an experience "rooted in Naughty Dog's passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay".

It's widely known that the game was developed in under two years - an extremely short amount of time that led to huge pressure and Nintendo employees working overtime.


As unearthed from Japanese magazines by YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming, the game's writers inserted their experience of crunch into the mouths of the game's NPCs.

According to Atomic Heart director Robert Bagratuni, the game's delay and our subsequent long wait for this release can be attributed to four things - "youth, ambition, innovation and new technology".

That's coming from FTC lawyer James Weingarten, who took part in a pretrial hearing on Tuesday to discuss Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a record-breaking $69bn.


Back in December, the FTC revealed its intention to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, claiming should the deal be allowed to proceed, it would enable the company to suppress its fellow games industry competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia just wrapped up its CES press conference, unveiling a new desktop graphics card - the RTX 4070 Ti - plus a lineup of RTX 40-series GPUs for laptops and a new RTX 4080 tier for its GeForce Now streaming service. Here's what you need to know.
First, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti. This is the renamed, repriced and now relaunched version of the RTX 4080 12GB that was so roundly derided upon its announcement that Nvidia 'unlaunched' the card soon thereafter. The key to that move was a feeling of confusion from gamers and press alike that the card was too distant in price and performance from the 4080 16GB, as it wasn't even based on the same AD103 chip. 
Now, the GPU seems more sensibly positioned - as a small improvement over the popular last-gen RTX 3080, with a price to match of $799. With DLSS 3 frame generation, it can be up to three times faster than the RTX 3090 Ti while consuming nearly half the power, although we look forward to putting those claims to the test. The latest Ada Lovelace card is scheduled to launch on January 5th, so we don't have too long to wait!

Pocket Card Jockey first launched on 3DS back in 2013, and is one of Game Freak's more successful non-Pokémon  games. An intriguing mash-up of horse racing and solitaire, it's gone on to earn cult status (though I recall Eurogamer's former in-house solitaire expert Oli Welsh being charmed but not wowed by this take on the form). 


Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! - spotted by our friends at VGC - is a buffed-up re-release for Apple Arcade,  with new 3D visuals for racing sections, and it's due out 20th January. It's got me wondering what other 3DS gems are ripe for being rescued by new ports - is it too much to hope for a re-release of Attack of the Friday Monsters?

Stuart's involment with the project was first announced back in 2021. However, speaking to Collider earlier this month, the screenwriter revealed he is no longer a showrunner on the adaptation due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives. 


"I think it was a little bit of a move of executives from LA to London, and it allowed the London group who, unfortunately, had to inherit my vision of what it was instead of getting to develop their own vision," Stuart explained to the publication.

With this publisher on board, Nightdive Studios has been able to "focus on quality-of-life improvements, bug fixing, and localisation support", things it calls "the last major steps towards releasing a game we're all incredibly proud of".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ken Block, star of Codemasters' Dirt series and a figure whose passion for motorsports helped push it to new audiences, has died at the age of 55 following a snowmobile accident on his ranch in Utah.

Block was an entrepreneur who co-founded DC Shoes in 1994, using his success to help pursue his automotive passions. In the 00s Block became a professional rally driver who went on to participate in the sport at its highest level in the WRC, though his results - with only a small handful of points and no podiums to show for his 24 appearances between 2007 and 2018 - don't reflect his true legacy as he popularised the sport through his hugely successful series of Gymkhana videos. 
WRC legend Sébastien Ogier led the many tributes to the great man. "Ken was a visionary, so passionate and inspiring," the eight-time WRC champion said on Twitter. "He knew like no other how to combine motorsport and a big show. He lived his life to the fullest and I'll never forget his smile and laugh."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World has released a new trailer for its upcoming shooter, with pre-orders for the game once again being available (they were initially refunded in the latter half of 2022). 


The trailer in question, which begins with a poignant reminder this game was made in Ukraine, can be seen below. While we still don't have a firm release date for Stalker 2 as yet, the developer once more promises a 2023 launch as part of the trailer's official description.



In addition to this, we also have the PC requirements for Stalker 2. These are as follows:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix, which raised eyebrows last year with its unflinching stance on NFTs and blockchain, has further affirmed its plans to focus in on the controversial technology this year. 


Meanwhile, it is steadily ending support for a selection of its games, making the company's offerings a much leaner dish for consumers (and perhaps potential buyers?).


In his recent New Year's letter, Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda stated 2023 will be a year of "major evolution and transformation" for the company, with "multiple blockchain games based on original IPs under development" at this time. Some of these, Matsuda noted, have already been announced, while others will be unveiled at a later date.

Kubernetes v1.26, released last month, introduced an alpha feature that
lets you specify a data source for a PersistentVolumeClaim, even where the source
data belong to a different namespace.
With the new feature enabled, you specify a namespace in the dataSourceRef field of
a new PersistentVolumeClaim. Once Kubernetes checks that access is OK, the new
PersistentVolume can populate its data from the storage source specified in that other
namespace.
Before Kubernetes v1.26, provided your cluster had the AnyVolumeDataSource feature enabled,
you could already provision new volumes from a data source in the same
namespace.
However, that only worked for the data source in the same namespace,
therefore users couldn't provision a PersistentVolume with …]]></summary>

<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eavesdropping from the user&#8217;s smartphone is a well-known threat to the user&#8217;s safety and privacy. Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.26 includes significant advancements in network traffic engineering with the graduation of
two features (Service internal traffic policy support, and EndpointSlice terminating conditions) to GA,

to address short-comings in traffic engineering that people face today, and unlock new capabilities for the future.

The Kubernetes 1.26 release includes a stable implementation of the Job
controller that can reliably track a large amount of Jobs with high levels of
parallelism. SIG Apps
and WG Batch
have worked on this foundational improvement since Kubernetes 1.22. After
multiple iterations and scale verifications, this is now the default
implementation of the Job controller.
Paired with the Indexed completion mode,
the Job controller can handle massively parallel batch Jobs, supporting up to
100k concurrent Pods.
The new implementation also made possible the development of Pod failure policy,
which is in beta in the 1.26 release.

Remember when Nintendo released its first update for Mario Kart 7 in 10 years? Well, it turns out that was to address a critical exploit that "could allow an attacker to achieve full console takeover".

Whilst the issue was reportedly first noted back in 2021, PabloMK7, Rambo6Glaz, Fishguy6564 have been credited with the discovery of "ENLBufferPwn", an exploit so serious, it was given a critical score of 9.8/10 in the CVSS 3.1 calculator.

But as well as referencing the game's movie sequel, Netflix show, and Sonic Origins and Sonic Frontiers - all of which dropped in 2022, of course - Iizuka teased that there was "a lot more outside of that" still to come, too.

"This past year was the biggest year in Sonic history, including the release of the movie sequel, new titles Sonic Origins and Sonic Frontiers, and the Netflix animation Sonic Prime," Sonic Team's Iizuka told Famitsu (thanks, Gematsu and Nintendo Life).

As well as the games developed by studios outside of China, 84 domestic games have also been given the green light in China, which Reuters calls "the world's largest gaming market".

Chinese megacorps like Tencent and NetEase are amongst those receiving approval, with the former reportedly securing licences for six of its games in December.

According to the Instagram account of PromoBricks - a Lego site that's successfully revealed unconfirmed Lego sets ahead of time before - the sets vary in size and complexity and will cost between $30 and $100 (that's £25 to £82, although the final localised price may differ).

Beyond that, however, not much else is known, but you can get a sneaky peek at what the sets may entail in the image shared by PromoBricks (thanks, VGC).

According to NHK and spotted by VGC, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office's Special Investigation Department have indicted Naka and Taisuke Sasaki for investing millions of yen in a company based on insider information that had yet to be made public.

The prosecutors allege that neither Naka nor Saskai would have invested the ¥144.7m if they hadn't known Square Enix was about to announce a partnership with a mobile developer.

Just like PlayStation's annual Wrap-Up feature, Steam Replay tots up "all of your playtime between the first second of January 1 and the last second of December 14 (GMT)" - albeit only the games you've played whilst online; offline play and time spent "running tools" is not included - and presents it as a convenient infographic.

As well as a highlight panel that shows how much time you've spent on the games that have kept you busiest over the last 12 months (for me, it's been indie ghosthunting hit Phasmophobia), you also get a summary of your achievements - including the "rare" ones - and your longest streak, as well as data that lets you know how you compare with the rest of Steam's community.

In an interview with the New Yorker (thanks, Comicbook), Druckmann said he hoped that the show will "put that video-game curse to bed", although screenwriter Craig Mazin acknowledged that it's "not the highest bar in the world" to become a great adaptation given some games, like Assassin's Creed, have "impenetrable" storylines.

"I love the ability to wander, to do nothing, in Skyrim," Mazin said, before adding that "that is not translatable!" By contrast, however, he said that "The Last of Us was always a story where the story comes first".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has hit back at Sony's objection to its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard by revealing that third-party games like Bloodborne, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Final Fantasy 16, and Silent Hill 2 Remake are party to "exclusion" agreements that will prevent those games from coming to Xbox consoles.

The news comes as part of Microsoft's response to the FTC's lawsuit against its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In the filing, Microsoft defends its position by turning the spotlight back onto Sony, detailing a handful of "prominent" games the company alleges have been barred from release on Xbox.

Whilst the filing acknowledges that "exclusivity strategies are not uncommon in the games industry", Microsoft seems to take issue with Sony's partnerships with third-party publishers, namely From Software, Square Enix, and Konami.

Like many artists, senior artist Frank Aliberti - who currently works as a senior character artist at 2K but formerly worked for PlayStation Studios Visual Arts - has his credits listed on ArtStation. 

It's Aliberti's work with PlayStation Studios Visual Arts that's caught our collective attention, however, as Aliberti's most recent credit indicated that they had worked as a senior artist on Death Stranding 2.

The CPU Manager is a part of the kubelet, the Kubernetes node agent, which enables the user to allocate exclusive CPUs to containers.
Since Kubernetes v1.10, where it graduated to Beta, the CPU Manager proved itself reliable and
fulfilled its role of allocating exclusive CPUs to containers, so adoption has steadily grown making it a staple component of performance-critical
and low-latency setups. Over time, most changes were about bugfixes or internal refactoring, with the following noteworthy user-visible changes:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author: Wei Huang (Apple), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google)
Kubernetes 1.26 introduced a new Pod feature: scheduling gates. In Kubernetes, scheduling gates
are keys that tell the scheduler when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.
What problem does it solve?
When a Pod is created, the scheduler will continuously attempt to find a node that fits it. This
infinite loop continues until the scheduler either finds a node for the Pod, or the Pod gets deleted.
Pods that remain unschedulable for long periods of time (e.g., ones that are blocked on some external event)
waste scheduling cycles. A scheduling cycle may take ≅20ms or more depending on the complexity of
the Pod's scheduling constraints. Therefore, at scale, those wasted cycles significantly impact the
scheduler's performance. See …]]></summary>

Feral Interactive has said, however, that the team is looking forward to "sharing more" news about these ports "in the new year!"

Tucked away in the newly issued document's many, many pages, Microsoft stated: "Xbox anticipates that three future titles - REDACTED - all of which are designed to be played primarily alone or in small groups - will be exclusive to Xbox and PCs."

Now almost two months on, players fear the Valderas Museum will never return. Season One saw the return of fan favourite maps Shoothouse and Shipment, but players criticised the paltry number of maps released. One wonders why Infinity Ward hasn't released a map that is seemingly complete and ready to ship. 


But players have taken it upon themselves to answer this question. Some have noticed the map's striking resemblance to the real-life Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal goes all the way back to 2018, when former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie disclosed to The Guardian and The New York Times that the UK-based company had scraped extensive data from Facebook without the explicit consent of users. 


The scandal led to investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and the UK's Information Commissioner's Office issuing a £500,000 fine to Facebook (this was before the GDPR had come into force, which allows for significantly higher financial penalties) and the US' Federal Trade Commission issuing a $5bn fine.

While Sony hasn't announced it as such, Gran Turismo is PlayStation's best-selling franchise. Much of that has to do with its longevity - there has been a Gran Turismo game on every PlayStation home console ever released.

The headline here is the addition of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, which came out in November 2019 and is set to get a sequel, Jedi Survivor, in March. The addition of Fallen Order to PS Plus Essential next month is well-timed in that context.


Elsewhere, Bethesda's online-focused RPG Fallout 76 joins PS Plus Essential next month (it's already in the PlayStation Plus Extra tier). Just yesterday we reported on how Fallout 76 has an impressive 13.5m players four years after its disastrous launch. I imagine joining PS Plus Essential will only fuel the player count.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has announced an end to "large scale updates" for embattled Nintendo Switch racer Chocobo GP just nine months after launch.


While the game will remain playable and rankings will continue without the use of prize pass levels, no new characters or maps will be released, effectively ending support following the conclusion of Season 5.


Meanwhile, sales of mythril, Chocobo GP's premium currency, have been discontinued. The in-game mythril shop will disappear on 6th January. All purchased mythril becomes "invalid" then, too. Square Enix said it will not issue refunds for purchased mythril.

Speaking to Game Informer, director Stig Asmussen stated players will discover "five fully realised stances in the game" for protagonist Cal Kestis, including a dedicated dual blade option and Kylo Ren-esque crossguard-style lightsaber (both of which were glimpsed in the most recent gameplay trailer, which you can see below).


As you may already have assumed, Asmussen said it will be "advantageous to use certain types of stances against certain types of enemies". This, the director says, will require the player to "break down the enemies and figure out what the best weapon of choice is".

The two faced each other while playing for their respective national teams in the World Cup final on Sunday, with the result securing Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time. But it also brought on a headache for the young Mbappe who scored a hat-trick in the match. 


Now the two will fly back to Paris to play together once again, and some have wondered what the changing room talk might be like.

Here he boasted about his impressive rag-dolling skills (he went to the "most prestigious rag-dolling school in the world", you see), and reflected that sometimes he just sits on a bench and ponders the world at large. All in all, some fairly inoffensive stuff.
