        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news, Zombie fans – two of the genre's biggest IPs, Dying Light and The Walking Dead, are partnering up for a "thrilling" crossover event.

Right now the details are scarce, but Techland popped up on Twitter to inform fans that it was "joining forces" with Skybound's The Walking Dead for a new event in which you'll get to "survive, scavenge, and slay the undead like never before".

"We know a thing or two about fighting the undead," the official Twitter account for The Walking Dead responded, although neither account told us what the event will entail, nor when we can expect to play it – we've just been asked to "stay tuned for more info".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last of Diablo 4's super-rare elusive items have finally been discovered in the wild.

Last week, Diablo 4's lead class designer, Adam Jackson, jumped online to "clear up" the confusion around some of Diable 4's rarest unique items, and it's from Jackson that we learned the names of the six rarest ones: Andariel's Visage, Doombringer, Harlequin Crest, Melted Heart of Selig, Ring of Starless Skies, and The Grandfather.

Up until that point, some extraordinarily lucky players had discovered five of the six items, but the most elusive one, Melted Heart of Selig, was still the stuff of legend… until yesterday, it seems, when the item finally dropped for a Chinese necromancer.

"Can Jala learn to love herself and heal the wounds of her past?" the video description teases, before giving us a two-minute peek at Jala's hectic world and family life, reminding some in the comments of Edgar Wright's film adaptation of Scott Pilgrim vs The World.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the second instalment of Toby Fox's reportedly seven-part "nonviolent" RPG Deltarune steadily approaching its second anniversary, fans are understandably eager to hear when more will be on the way, and while Fox mightn't be ready to divulge that particularly bit of information yet, he has now offered a development update.


Deltarune - which charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World - launched its first chapter toward the end of 2018 as a free download. A second instalment - also free - arrived in September 2021, followed by the news a third, fourth and fifth chapter will all launch simultaneously at a later date.


The big question for Deltarune fans, though, is when, and the answer, if Fox's latest progress report is anything to go by, still sounds very much like 'not any time soon'. Fox does reveal, however, the team is currently working on Chapter 3's last overworld area - and once that's done, "the chapter will finally be playable all the way through".

News that Ubisoft has finally decided to give everyone what they more or less wanted in the first place comes via Kotaku, which claims, citing two sources familiar with the publisher's plans, that the remake is "still in its earliest stages".


Ubisoft Singapore - the same studio still trying to finish the embattled Skull and Bones - is "heavily involved" with the project, which isn't expected to complete "for at least a few years".

        <updated>2023-06-30T18:19:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment, the company behind this year's critically lambasted The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, is reportedly set to exit game development and has laid off around 25 employees as part of the move. Additionally, a second Lord of the Rings game in development at the studio is said to have been cancelled.


Daedalic's The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was announced in 2019 for release in 2021, finally arrived last month, following numerous setbacks and delays. Its reception was less-than-positive, however, with Eurogamer's Christian Donlan calling it a "well-intentioned mess" in his 1 out of 5 review. It was something of a surprise, then, when reports surfaced soon after that Daedalic was currently working on a second Lord of the Rings game.


According to German website Games Wirtschaft, however, that game - which has reportedly been in the works since mid-2022 - is no more, with development now cancelled as part of Daedalic's sudden decision to shift away from development and solely into publishing following Gollum's poor reception.

Earlier this week, as part of the FTC vs Microsoft court case, internal documents were released suggesting Microsoft had at one point considered buying the Japanese company to boost its Game Pass offering.



Sega's co-chief operating officer Shuji Utsumi has now dismissed speculation the company is still open to acquisitions.

Specifically, Sony was worried about the game's popularity among children causing problems for PlayStation.


The details come from a 2022 document uncovered as part of the FTC vs Microsoft trial, spotted by Axios, in which PlayStation boss Jim Ryan discusses Roblox's absence from Sony consoles - and admits his company's stance from the game is now shifting.

The court case between Microsoft and the FTC came to a close yesterday, after several days of testimonies, revelations and Sharpie-related blunders. 


During the proceedings, Microsoft's lawyer took to the floor in a bid to clear up a bit of a misunderstanding surrounding Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. However, in doing so, they perhaps made things a touch more confusing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has once again addressed the Xbox version of its upcoming RPG Baldur's Gate 3, confirming that while it's still in the work, the developer may ultimately be forced to make "compromises" in order to release on the platform.


Larian's struggles with Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox first surfaced in February, when - amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive - the studio confirmed it was working on an Xbox version but that it had "run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op."


In a statement provided to Digital Foundry shortly after, Larian explained its decision not to formally announced an Xbox release was more specifically down to issues it was having getting "split-screen co-op to work to the same standard on both Xbox Series X and S". And now, in an interview with IGN, studio founder and creative director Swen Vincke has shared more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were first introduced to Pioneers of Pagonia, a new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich, earlier this year, there wasn't much to go on beyond a brief description and a teaser video. Now, though, with its early access release steadily drawing nearer, we've been given a first proper look at the thing via a new in-game trailer.


Pioneers of Pagonia, to get the fundamentals out the way, sets players loose on the titular (and procedurally generated) islands of Pagonia with the goal of establishing a presence through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover - and the alliances they forge with Pagonia's not always friendly inhabitants - along the way.


40 different building types have also been promised for Pioneers of Pagonia's Steam early access launch, along with more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. A co-op mode is also planned, meaning you'll be able to be a ruinous blight on the land (or otherwise, I suppose) with a friend in tow.

RoboCop: Rogue City - which is build around an "original story" set between RoboCop 2 and 3 - looks to land somewhere between a first-person shooter and cybernetically enhanced detective adventure, whisking players to the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit to solve crimes, slay baddies, and perhaps even turn a few wrong 'uns into goo.


"Explore open areas and complete your objectives according to your own sense of justice," explains Teyon. "Finding evidence, interrogation and maintaining public order are just some of your daily tasks as a police officer. But don't take decisions lightly: your choices can determine the fate of citizens and the result of your mission."

And it was a typically strong showing for the publisher, offering a fresh look at some already announced titles - including the new one from Sayonara Wild Hearts' studio Simogo and the fascinating Cocoon - as well as some big reveals. From stunning photographic adventures to an honest-to-goodness new Blade Runner game, there's a lot to look forward to in the months and year ahead, and a full round-up of the showcase can be found below.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes

Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo's latest is a baroque blend of surreal mystery thriller and puzzle adenture, faintly bringing to mind the studio's iOS classic Device 6. It focuses on a woman's search for answers, deep in a strange manor house, as players attempt to solve the enigma at its heart. There's no release date yet, but we do it's coming to Switch and Steam - and while we await further details, there's a tantilising new trailer above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Microsoft argues with the Federal Trade Commission in the US over its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Canada moved to refute the Xbox maker's claims that, the FTC excluded, "all but one" regulator around the world is onboard with its deal - noting that Canada is still 'monitoring the transaction'.


As reported by The Verge, Canada's Competition Bureau has written to Judge Corley, who is currently presiding over the FTC's Activision Blizzard case in the US, to correct certain "factual inaccuracies" in Microsoft's court filings.


Microsoft had told the court that "every single worldwide regulator that has examined the deal other than the FTC has rejected" the theory it would remove Call of Duty from PlayStation should the acquisition go through, and that all regulators agreed "withholding COD from Sony would be unprofitable and is thus not a serious concern." It also claimed "all but one foreign regulator" (namely the UK's CMA) had cleared the transaction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go maker Niantic will lay off 230 staff - around a quarter of the company - and has cancelled a major upcoming project developed in conjunction with Marvel. 


The company will close its recently-released NBA All-World game, end development of its upcoming Marvel World of Heroes project, and shut down its Los Angeles development studio. The news was communicated to staff via an email from company founder John Hanke, which has now been made public.


Pokémon Go, which remains lucrative, is safe. Indeed, Hanke calls it the company's "top priority" as it slims down and refocuses on the future.

A big draw this month is Darkwood, the nightmarish survival horror game from Acid Wizard Studio, which will be available between 1st July until 31st July.

Darkwood, which originally released on PC in 2017, is a frightening horror experience that combines exploration, combat, scavenging, crafting and survival into an extremely unusual whole. Our Donlan called it "a masterclass in how to undermine the audience in tiny, gnat-bite ways" when he played it back in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we look back at a week of headlines from Microsoft's time in court arguing its case to buy Activision Blizzard with the FTC.

In the video game industry, courtroom drama does not get much bigger than this. Microsoft's Phil Spencer and Satya Nadella, Sony's Jim Ryan and Activision boss Bobby Kotick have all given evidence as the US weighs up whether to allow Xbox's enormous Call of Duty buyout to procede.
The week has brought us some eye-opening opinions from these top industry execs, as well as a treasure trove of emails to pore through - and some badly-redacted documentation. Today, we recap the biggest stories of the week, including who else was on Microsoft's studio shopping list, and why Bethesda is upset at Call of Duty not being platform exclusive. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4's time rewind feature is a big addition to the series, though I admit being apprehensive at first around how it might be deployed. After a week with the game - and you can read some of my early thoughts here - I've come to use it sparingly, but appreciate its existence.


As its name suggests, the feature allows you to skip backwards and undo any sudden calamity. Though in doing so, my initial fear was it risked devaluing the Pikmin series' usual high stakes.


After all, the frequent likelihood of imminent Pikmin death - their agonising squeals, the sad sight of their soul floating slowly upwards - acts to ensure you approach each situation with care.

Ryan, speaking in pre-recorded video testimony, also claimed other publishers "unanimously do not like Game Pass" for that reason. When pressed by Microsoft's lawyer, he added: "I talk to publishers all the time, and this is a very commonly-held view over many years by the publishers."
Talking to Eurogamer yesterday, Miles Jacobson, studio head of Sports Interactive, the Sega-owned developer of the ever-popular Football Manager series, disagreed with that quite directly.

Thanks to the retrospectively poor choice of using a Sharpie marker to redact the key information, it's easy to see the contents of these redactions now the document has been scanned.

The Kubernetes community has been signing their container image-based artifacts
since release v1.24. While the graduation of the corresponding enhancement
from alpha to beta in v1.26 introduced signatures for the binary artifacts,
other projects followed the approach by providing image signatures for their
releases, too. This means that they either create the signatures within their
own CI/CD pipelines, for example by using GitHub actions, or rely on the
Kubernetes image promotion process to automatically sign the images by
proposing pull requests to the k/k8s.io repository. A requirement for
using this process is that the project is part of the kubernetes or
kubernetes-sigs GitHub organization, so that they can utilize the community
infrastructure for pushing images…]]></summary>

The Cycle: Frontier, which arrived on PC last June, sees teams of players - in the role of Prospectors - airdropping onto a hostile alien planet in order to gather resources, fend off predators and competing teams with a steadily expanding arsenal, then whizz back into space at the end with all their hard-earned spoils.


The game has seen three seasons of updates since its launch last summer, but Yager has now announced development is coming to an end, with its most recent patch being its last.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of Microsoft's court battle with US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission, emails between Xbox boss Phil Spencer and PlayStation head Jim Ryan have been revealed, outlining Microsoft's initial proposal to Sony - regarding the Activision Blizzard games it would be willing to keep on the PlayStation platform should its $69bn acquisition be approved - and Ryan's lengthy counter-proposal.


As confirmed by Phil Spencer last September, Microsoft contacted Sony shortly after the January announcement of its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, providing a signed agreement to Sony guaranteeing Call of Duty would remain on PlayStation - with feature and content parity - for "at least several more years beyond" Sony current contract.


During his FTC deposition this week, Ryan admitted he "wasn't particularly" happy with Microsoft's original proposal, but "hoped it was an opening salvo" - and we now have a more precise picture of his initial response, thanks to newly revealed emails, as spotted by The Verge's Tom Warren. In a reply dated 26th May, Ryan informed Spencer that Microsoft's proposal "did not fulfil" the objective of "ensuring Activision Blizzard games are available on PlayStation", and that the company had "serious concerns" which an enclosed counter-proposal from Sony was intended to address.

The idea was floated among Xbox top brass back in 2019 - before Square Enix sold its suite of Western studios, and before Microsoft got entangled in its current attempted $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout. 


Documents showing Microsoft's interest in acquiring Square Enix surfaced today, as the company continues to plead its case with the Federal Trade Commission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go developer Niantic has infuriated fans by reverting a positive change to the game's spawn radius that let you see Pokémon spawns from twice as far away. 


The change went live earlier this week and was praised by players. But, last night, Niantic announced via Twitter that the buff would be removed. 


Adding to the confusion is the fact that the game's community leaders - who are regularly fed information by Niantic - were allegedly told the game was working "as intended" with the spawn change applied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four Mega Drive games have joined Nintendo's Switch Online service, including two Zelda-like adventures.


The first is Landstalker, an isometric adventure developed by Climax Entertainment and released in 1993 in which players take the role of treasure hunter Nigel (no, really). Many of the team went on to develop Alundra for the PlayStation, considered something of a spiritual successor to Landstalker.

Experience rewards have been buffed for Nightmare Dungeons - specifically increasing the experience for both killing monsters in these dungeons and completing them - making them well suited for high level players looking to grind.


Helltide chests will also provide "substantially more bonus experience when opened", and Whispers have similarly had a significant increase in rewarded experience.

Brilliant post-apocatalyptic feline simulator Stray is among those getting the chop - just ahead of publisher Annapurna Interactive's upcoming digital showcase event, where we may see an Xbox version of the game.


Live-service game flop Marvel's Avengers is also being removed, although the game itself will still be playable if you pay and gets its final update in September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the news that development of BioWare's free-to-play MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic would be shifting to a third-party studio, BioWare general manager Gary McKay has now confirmed some team members will lose their jobs as a result of the move.


Writing on the BioWare website, McKay explained that "most of the current team will be invited to accompany" Star Wars: The Old Republic as its development switches over to Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot studio Broadsword Online Games - a move EA previously said was necessary so BioWare could focus on its new Mass Effect and Dragon Age titles.


"Unfortunately," McKay continued, "not every role will make the move. This is the hardest part of this transition, and these decisions were not made lightly."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 5 - or Project Rene, as EA is currently calling - is still some considerable way from release, but that isn't stopping developer Maxis from showing off its early experiments exploring what this "next generation" Sims game could be - and the studio has now shared a little more as part of its latest Sims stream.


When Project Rene was officially unveiled in October last year, EA teased a game built on a foundation of "charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories" that would be designed with real-time collaboration in mind (solo play is still supported) and be simultaneously playable across a range of devices, including mobile and PC.


At the time, footage was limited to some expanded creativity tools inspired by The Sims 3's Create a Style options, but Project Rene's latest airing in EA's new Behind the Sims showcase (which also had a lot to say about horses) has gone into a little more detail about what The Sims 5 might look like if Maxis' current experiments prove fruitful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has announced a new batch of titles heading to its Apple Arcade subscription service in July, including two particularly notable oldies-but-goodies: Stardew Valley and Slay the Spire, which both arrive in '+' form, denoting they were previously available on the iOS App Store.


Stardew Valley+, as if it needs an introduction, is developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's wildly popular spin on the farm life sim genre, having now sold over 20m copies since its launch in 2016. Apple Arcade subscribers will have the opportunity to succumb to its endearing blend of agricultural wealth accumulation and pixel wooing from 28th July.


As for Slay the Spire+, it's also a bit of a modern classic. Developer Mega Crit Games' roguelike deck-building dungeon-crawler - which sees players attempting to fend off monsters and scale the titular spire with nothing but a fist of battle-ready cards - is a wonderfully refined, richly rewarding experience, and well worth seeking out.

As reported by Variety, the new series - which is being handled by Big Mouth and Star: Trek Lower Decks animation studio Titmouse - looks to be adhering closely to the core murder-and-deduction premise of its video game source material.


The show's official longline reads, "Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone. Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs."

Air Twister, which launched for Apple's Apple Arcade subscription service last June, sees players battling alien invaders through 12 stages - and across various modes including  Arcade, Turbo, and Boss Rush - to save a planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


The ensuing action is a bit Space Harrier and a bit Panzer Dragoon - at certain points players take to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and Yu Suzuki has previously said Air Twister was inspired by a fantasy shooting game he envisaged in the 80s, before pivoting toward Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 arrives this October more than than 13 years after Remedy's original game, and after a number of false starts at getting the sequel made. 


Much of developer Remedy's original pitch for the sequel eventually worked its way into Alan Wake's American Nightmare, the action-heavy 2012 standalone spinoff which, while not unanimously loved by critics, went on to be one of the cult hits of the old Xbox Live Arcade days.


Remedy has continued to work on ideas for a full sequel ever since, through the period where it released Quantum Break - the Xbox One exclusive that mixed time-bending action and shooting with live-action TV episodes - and then the fellow "Remedy connected universe" entry Control.

In particular, the game will include The Eye of the Wanderer, which will allow players to pin screenshots to the map to help with exploration.


"The genre is quite dependent on being able to 'take mental notes'; remembering and visualising things like blocked paths, or situations that need tools or powers that you don't have," said senior game designer Rémi Boutin.

That's according to the series' executive producer Tomek Baginski, who has discussed the upcoming third season of the show - the last to star Henry Cavill as the protagonist - in an interview with Yahoo News, where the shift to Hemsworth for future seasons was mentioned.

Story spoilers for The Witcher book series and games follow.

Earlier this year, the Hitman developer announced it was working on a "bold" new franchise. Very little else was shared, other than a tease it would feel both familiar and "unlike anything" the studio had done before. No platforms, or even a project name, were announced at this time.


However, evidence submitted in the ongoing FTC vs Microsoft trial suggests this upcoming release - known (for now) as Project Dragon - will seemingly be an Xbox console exclusive.

The email, sent to Xbox exec Tim Stuart, has publicly surfaced now during Microsoft's ongoing courtroom battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout. In it, Booty encourages Xbox to make further acquisitions to bolster Game Pass and compete with Sony.


"We (Microsoft) are in a very unique position to be able to go spend Sony out of business," Booty wrote, in reference to planned spending of spending $2-3bn in 2020 to avoid competitors getting ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's promise it would keep Call of Duty on rival console platforms after buying Activision Blizzard prompted concern within Bethesda at its highest levels, a newly-published email now shows. 


Bethesda marketing exec Pete Hines emailed bosses, including Todd Howard, to highlight the approach Microsoft was taking with Activision in order to court regulatory approval and note that it was "the opposite" of what Bethesda itself had just been "asked (told) to do" with its own games. 


The email, dated 2nd October last year, expresses concern that Bethesda would be publicly questioned on why games like Starfield are Xbox-only following Microsoft's acquisition, as opposed to future incarnations of Call of Duty after Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Microsoft's court battle with US antitrust agency the FTC rumbles on, more and more juicy snippets of behind-closed-doors business doings are beginning to surface via released internal documents, and today's minor revelation comes via the news that Microsoft reportedly gave serious consideration to buying Sega - and other companies including Bungie and IO Interactive - to help it accelerate Xbox Game Pass.


This little bit of what-might-have-been comes via internal Microsoft documents spotted by The Verge, beginning with an email from Xbox boss Phil Spencer to CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, requesting strategy approval to approach Sega Sammy about a potential acquisition of its Sega games division.


Spencer suggested Sega's "well-balanced portfolio of games across segments with global geographic appeal" would help Microsoft "accelerate Xbox Game Pass both on and off-console", and that Sega's "beloved IP" would be particularly effective in helping Games Pass reach new audiences in Asia, "where localised content is critical to success".

Meta Quest+ isn't quite the Game Pass or PlayStation Plus Extra-style smorgasbord you might be envisaging, however; instead, it'll give subscribers access to two "handpicked VR titles" each month from a selection of Quest's "biggest hits, hidden gems, and back-catalog classics".


Meta Quest+ is available to Quest 2 and Quest Pro users, and costs £7.99/$7.99 USD a month or £59.99/$59.99 annually - a savings of over 37%, Meta notes. Curious sorts can get their first month's subscription for £1/$1 as long as they sign up before 31st July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Closing in on four year since its announcement, Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot is still nowhere to be seen, and a new report claims a succession of unfortunate setbacks has lead to "little meaningful progress" on the project since its 2020 unveiling.


When Microsoft revealed its Perfect Dark reboot for Xbox during The Game Awards in December 2020, it confirmed the project was being developed by The Initiative, the Santa Monica-based studio founded by Crystal Dynamics veteran Darrell Gallagher.


Since then, sporadic reports have suggested something of a tumultuous journey for the project; Crystal Dynamics was brought in to assist The Initiative in September 2021, game director Dan Neuburger departed the studio in March last year, and an exodus of over 30 key staff was reported shortly after - causing head of Microsoft Studios Matt Booty to insist the game wasn't in trouble during a panel talk in September 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in May, from an FAQ provided by developer Remedy, Alan Wake 2 will only have a digital release when it launches on October 17th later this year, with "no plans" for a physical release on disc at the time.
This has naturally sparked some concern among certain fans, with digital-only downloads posing issues for both game preservation, as shown by the closure of the Nintendo 3DS eShop in March this year, as well as ownership rights, exemplified by the infamously de-listed survival horror spinoff PT.
Speaking to Eurogamer at Summer Games Fest earlier this month, Alan Wake 2's creative director Sam Lake and game director Kyle Rowley gave us a little more detail on the reasoning behind going digital-only, explaining that, actually, it was to allow Remedy more time to polish the game to an acceptable level - something publisher Epic Games had also been on board with.

However, along with this release, changes have been made to the games' credits, with several former Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio staff members and entire support studios not being acknowledged for their work on the series.


As spotted by Timo653 over on Reddit, developers such as series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and producer Daisuke Sato - who both left Sega several years ago to form Nagoshi Studio, a subsidiary of NetEase Games - are no longer credited for their work on the games. 


Meanwhile, the entirety of Lab42 (which worked on 0 and Kiwami 1, helping to bring these games to PC) and QLOC (which worked on Kiwami 2 to 6) have also seen their credits removed.

Born by way of an internet urban legend in 2009, Slender Man has popped up in many fan-made and indie horror games, but his most notable in-game appearances include Slender: The Eight Pages in 2012 and 2013's Slender: The Arrival before a highly-publicised stabbing incident and moral panic saw the fictional entity go dark for several years.

In a statement, the studio defined what it believed datamining to be – the practice of "extracting information from massive datasets" and "illegal infiltration of in-game code and databases in order to extract information that is intentionally hidden from users" – and said that "in-game accounts involved in datamining and/or sharing data originating from datamining" will be banned, and "further actions taken afterwards".

"Throughout the past few years, there was an increase of datamined information circling around various websites as well as accounts on social media," the team explains. "While some players believe that the developers of Escape from Tarkov are not sharing information about hidden changes of the game, we also would like to remind that any data retrieval without official permission is a direct breach of [...] the license agreement."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls 6 is unlikely to release for at least "five-plus" years.

That's according to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who recently confirmed that the latest instalment of the highly-anticipated RPG series was still "five-plus years away".

As reported by Axios' Stephen Totilo – who had been live-tweeting the outcomes from day two of the US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)/Microsoft court case all yesterday – Spencer was "asked a lot" about how Microsoft decides platform exclusivity, with much of the questioning framed around Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax.

Mortal Kombat 1's stress test – a finite testing period designed to "deliberately stress [NetherRealm's] online infrastructure and identify potential issues" ahead of its launch later this year – is currently underway.
 As the test is private and open only to pre-selected players, scalpers are trying their luck and flogging their codes, even though the test is free and only running this weekend, closing at 4pm BST/8am PDT on Monday, 26th June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's almost time for American Truck Simulator to cross over a new state line as SCS Software readies its new Oklahoma expansion for release - and in the run-up to its arrival, the studio has shared a soothing 15-minute drive through its digital reimagining of the Sooner State.


Oklahoma will be American Truck Simulator's 13th explorable state when it makes its eventual debut - it joins California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas - and promises a tour of "wonderful state parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends."


You can get a brief taste of the expansion's highways, byways, and sweeping vistas in SCS Software's newly released Oklahoma gameplay preview trailer below - which, as ever, is basically video game ASMR, so dim the lights, grab a pillow, and let your cares drift away amid the gentle murmur of digital wheels on digital tarmac.

It all started after Twitter user Nitroid began poking around the Metal Gear portal website and noticed a spot of oddness with Konami's updated Metal Gear timeline.


The gist of the discovery is that Konami's revised graphic featured a number of inactive buttons for old games pointing to new pages, leading to speculation that these particular titles - Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and Metal Gear Solid 5 - were being primed for a re-release as part of a Master Collection Vol. 2.

Alan Wake memorably begins with a voiceover from the game's main character quoting King in a description of what nightmares really mean.


Speaking to Eurogamer, Remedy boss Sam Lake revealed he had "really, really, desperately wanted" to be able to open the game with a quote from King himself - whose style matches much of the spooky supernatural horror that follows.

A special birthday update for Sonic Frontiers has been on the cards for some time now, having been announced as part of an expansive post-launch support roadmap at the end of last year. Now, however, with Sonic's big day finally here, we've got a clearer idea of what it'll bring.


For starters, the ordinarily rather drab world of Sonic Frontiers gets a splash of birthday cheer, festooned with the likes of balloons, wrapping paper, and other decor. Additionally, there's a jaunty party hat outfit for Sonic so everyone can properly get in the mood.

Blizzard previously detailed its plans for seasonal content (which begins next month) in a blog post but failed to mention the need for a new character. 


However, Diablo franchise general manager Rod Fergusson has now confirmed the requirement, while responding to a fan via Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has at last served up some backstory for The Traveller, Destiny's long-running space moon/golfball thing which has been floating above Earth for much of the past decade. 


Destiny 1, which launched almost nine years ago, introduced The Traveller as a mysterious dormant entity that previously held magical powers, as well as the ability to hold back the ominous-sounding Darkness. 


Where had it come from? What were the nature of its powers? Was the Traveller actually a bad guy? I remember wondering all of these things as I looked up at the orb from Destiny's first Tower hub.

Rumours that McConaughey, along with Mahershala Ali, were both in talks for the part were discussed by Josh Horowitz on his Happy Sad Confused podcast (thanks IGN). Here, The Last of Us' TV showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed he had spoken with McConaughey about playing Joel.


"I actually never talked to Mahershala," he confirmed. "I did talk to Matthew. I wouldn't say that it was serious, it was more of just like, 'Hey, here's something we can talk about'."

The message, sent by PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, was quoted in court by Xbox last night as the US Federal Trade Commission began its hearing into Microsoft's attempted $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout.


"It is not an exclusivity play at all," Ryan wrote in an email to former PlayStation Europe boss Chris Deering. "They're thinking bigger than that.

Earlier this month, the developer confirmed the game would be moving to a third-party studio so BioWare can focus its efforts on the forthcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and future Mass Effect game.


Fans have since been concerned about the future of The Old Republic, but a new forum post from executive producer Keith Kanneg lays out the future of the game, and notes BioWare is currently helping with "planning for 2024 and 2025".

ORIGINAL STORY 10.11pm: Following the shock cancellation of this year's E3 back in March, new details shared by the Los Angeles City Tourism Department suggest the games industry trade show won't be making a comeback anytime soon, with shows scheduled for 2024 and 2025 now also seemingly cancelled.


As spotted by Restera, the Entertainment Software Association, which owns E3, had initially booked the Los Angeles Convention Centre for the weeks beginning 11th June 2024 and 3rd June 2025 - dates shared as part of a Los Angeles City Tourism Department report last October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why, it's horse, of course! As widely expected thanks to a few cheeky leaks earlier this week, The Sims 4 is ushering in a new age of the equine for its next paid expansion; Horse Ranch, as the release is known, arrives on 20th July for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


Horse Ranch's primary focus is Chestnut Ridge, a new rustic prairie world inspired by the American West. Here, players can live out an idyllic life - either in a traditional country cabin or in something with a few more mod cons - caring for mini goats, mini sheep, and, of course, horses, which can be rescued, bred, purchased, customised, and raised from foals.


Sims not afraid to get their hands dirty have plenty of options on the ranch, from mucking out horse beds to harvesting prairie grass for the animal feeder, and it's even possible to brew moonsh... sorry, Nectar, by smashing up fruit and veg then ageing the results on Nectar racks ready for sale. There's also sheep shearing, goat milking, and other animal interactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking during today's FTC hearing, Bethesda's Pete Hines has confirmed the company's upcoming Indiana Jones game will be exclusive to Xbox and PC, with the court being told a multi-console contract was amended following the company's acquisition by Microsoft.


Bethesda announced its Indiana Jones game back in January 2021, confirming it was being developed by Wolfenstein studio MachineGames. However, it failed to make mention of the platforms it would target, a notable omission at the time given Microsoft's then-impending $7.5bn USD acquisition of Bethesda and Zenimax.


Little has been heard of the game since that initial reveal, but it's now burst back into the spotlight in something of an unexpected way - during a witness testimony from Bethesda's head of global publishing Pete Hines, as part of US antitrust agency the FTC's court proceedings to secure an injunction to block Microsoft's $69bn Activision Blizzard deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just three years after its much-heralded arrival, Activision is pulling the plug on the original Call of Duty: Warzone. The free-to-play battle royale shooter set to go offline on 21st September.


Call of Duty: Warzone launched along Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2020, but was renamed Warzone Caldera after the arrival of its similarly styled successor, Warzone 2.0, last November.


Warzone Caldera has remained available in the months since then - meaning players have been able to continue using real-money purchases including skins and weapons unavailable in 2.0 - but now Activision has signalled the end is in sight for the original experience, warning that all progression, inventories, and online services will "expire" in September.

As part of a (heavily redacted) court filing intended to supplement the five-day case, Microsoft has once again attempted to portray itself the underdog in the console market.

For Nintendo, yesterday's online extravaganza acted like a shot of adrenaline to Switch's aging heart. There had been questions around how much Nintendo might still have for Switch, post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Now we have answers - and a release schedule busier than either Microsoft or Sony's for the remainder of 2023. Switch 2 certainly now feels even longer away.
Microsoft, meanwhile, took advantage of the Elephant Mario in the room to announce it's long-suspected price rises for Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Series X. It was an oppurtune moment for Microsoft to deliver the bad news, with the value of Game Pass demonstrated last week at its well-receieved Xbox Game Showcase. Still, was it really necessary? Or could it just get away with it because PlayStation blinked first? Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch has launched a new Hype Chat feature to allow viewers pay to have messages pinned at the top of the chat window.


The main aim is to provide a new way for viewer messages to stand out in a busy, fast moving chat, as well as an additional method for streamers to make money.


Messages can be purchased from $1 to $500 (with streamers able to set a minimum up to $100) and the duration, character count, and visual design of the pin will depend on the amount spent. Twitch will take a 30 percent cut of revenue earned.

At the beginning of this year, CCP Games announced its year-long roadmap for the game, where it stated its aim to launch Excel integration in May for Omega subscribers.

The Excel add-in is now free to use for all players, after launching yesterday. Eve's API is used to import player data, meaning no programming knowledge is required.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Past Within, developer Rusty Lake's wonderfully sinister time-travelling co-op puzzler, is ready to make the jump to a new platform, and will be launching for Switch on 6th July.


The Past Within is the latest in a series that has so far spanned 15 loosely interconnected games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banners, with another one - the recently announced Underground Blossom - expected to arrive on PC later this year.


Like its predecessors, The Past Within delivers a deliciously surreal mix of casual point-and-click puzzling and room escape action, albeit this time given a devious co-operative twist.

        <updated>2023-06-22T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Action roguelike Midautumn is named after the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the most important events of the calendar for many countries in Asia. It's a celebration of the full moon, usually falling in September or October, though traditions vary between countries. For me, it's a time of year I'll always associate with the mooncakes my grandma shares with us. For Midautumn developer Sherveen Uduwana, it brings back memories of attending these festivals as a child, and the comfort of lanterns and fireworks floating in the dark night sky.


Available in demo form during LudoNarraCon last month, Midautumn's blend of thematic storytelling and action mechanics immediately caught my eye - as well as its name. Still, Uduwana is aware Midautumn's title - and the experiences within Asian diaspora communities that inspired him - won't immediately feel familiar to many others. "I think a lot of folks I was pitching it to were like, why is it called Midautumn?" Uduwana tells me, adding that he settled on the name very early on. "There's a specific type of person who, when they find out the game is called Midautumn, gets very excited."


Uduwana tried pitching the game in a traditional way to secure funding, but the culture gap - and then, more significantly, the pandemic and the wave of anti-Asian sentiment surrounding it - caused him to opt for a more indie development approach instead. "That galvanised me to just be like, I'm just gonna message people and we'll try and make it," he says. "I was tired of having to explain why people would relate to it, or why it would be something that would be exciting for folks. A lot of people in those positions of power are just not really tuned into those specific communities."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roblox, the hugely-popular game platform used by millions of younger players, has introduced a 17+ age category for experiences aimed at older audiences. 


Current categories exist for All Ages, 9+ and 13+, and Roblox has traditionally been seen as a place popular for children to play. 


But Roblox's audience is growing older - a natural step as the game matures in age and retains players as it does so - and 38 percent of Roblox's most active users were 17 and older in 2022, Roblox has said, making it the game's fastest-growing age group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has said that Sony would no longer be able to share details of its upcoming console hardware with Call of Duty maker Activision, if Microsoft's proposed $68.7bn buyout was approved by regulators.


Speaking to the US Federal Trade Commission, which is currently involved in legal proceedings to block the deal, Ryan said Sony "simply could not run the risk of a company that was owned by a direct competitor having access to that information".


Ryan's comments date from April this year, when the FTC questioned the PlayStation CEO on statements submitted by Sony designed to give its perspective on the deal. Chief among those is the worry by Sony that its game development processes would be interrupted as it "could no longer share confidential details about its next console in development".

This Friday more specifically marks 32 years since Sonic's western debut on Sega Mega Drive, which technically (if I have my hedgehog lore right) means he'll be celebrating his 47th birthday given his age in the first game. So before his back gives out completely, Sega will presumably be keen to shove as many announcement out as possible.


Friday's Sonic Central, then, is promising a "sneak peek of some of our upcoming projects, partnerships, and events happening in 2023".

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will increase from £10.99/€12.99/$14.99 USD a month to £12.99/€14.99/$16.99, while Game Pass for Console rises from £7.99/€9.99/$8.99 a month to £8.99/€10.99/$10.99. Xbox Game Pass for PC will be unaffected.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The computer security research community regularly tackles ethical questions. The field of ethics / moral philosophy has for centuries considered what it means to be &#8220;morally good&#8221; or at least &#8220;morally allowed / acceptable.&#8221; Among philosophy&#8217;s contributions are (1) frameworks for evaluating the morality of actions&#8212;including the well-established consequentialist and deontological frameworks&#8212;and (2) scenarios (like trolley problems) featuring moral dilemmas that can facilitate discussion about and intellectual inquiry into different perspectives on moral reasoning and decision-making. In a classic trolley problem, consequentialist and deontological analyses may render different opinions. In this research, we explicitly make and explore connections between moral questions in computer security research and ethics / moral philosophy through the creation and analysis of trolley problem-like computer security-themed moral dilemmas and, in doing so, we seek to contribute to conversations among security researchers about the morality of security research-related decisions. We explicitly do not seek to define what is morally right or wrong, nor do we argue for one framework over another. Indeed, the consequentialist and deontological frameworks that we center, in addition to coming to different conclusions for our scenarios, have significant limitations. Instead, by offering our scenarios and by comparing two different approaches to ethics, we strive to contribute to how the computer security research field considers and converses about ethical questions, especially when there are different perspectives on what is morally right or acceptable. Our vision is for this work to be broadly useful to the computer security community, including to researchers as they embark on (or choose not to embark on), conduct, and write about their research, to program committees as they evaluate submissions, and to educators as they teach about computer security and ethics...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

But after today's Nintendo Direct we have a much clearer picture of what's still to come, with a look at Pikmin 4 headlining the showcase, plus reveals of a Super Mario RPG remake and a brand new 2D Mario game.


First, though, Nintendo showed a fresh look at the forthcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC heading to Switch later this year.

Wave five will arrive this summer, complete with a new course known as Squeaky Clean Sprint. 


From what we can see in the trailer, this course looks to be taking us around a sud-filled bathroom, with plenty of bubbles and bottles to negotiate. It will be joined by another seven courses, which are yet to be announced.

At first glance, Super Mario Bros. Wonder's presentation is all very New Super Mario, with its crisp, clean lines - albeit this time slightly stylised - and familiar Mario motifs. But then, midway through its announcement trailer, Mario encounters a new power-up and things get weird.


Warp pipes come alive in wiggly choreography, heaving and bending all over the place; spherical cows come tumbling in; Mario - and the world around him - gets a new stretchy, silhouetted look, and here come mega-herds of adorable sheep!

Several developers have flirted with this new technology, with the likes of Ubisoft announcing its Ghostwriter AI tool earlier this year. Meanwhile, the High on Life team used AI to create video game voice dialogue.


Last week, I had the opportunity to chat with voice actors Jennifer Hale and David Hayter about their upcoming release, Synapse, and during this conversation, the topic of AI came up.


"I have been staying on top of it," Hale assured me when I asked about the actors' personal take on the matter. "And the number one thing I want to say to everybody out there is: Stay out of fear. Stay in action."

The first Pikmin introduced the world to Captain Olimar and his titular half-plant, half-animal pals back on GameCube in 2001. A sequel followed in 2004, expanding on the original's real-time strategy style puzzling with new Pikmin, cave exploration, and more.


Since then, both titles have received gentle updates for Wii, introducing a pointer-style control system. However, it's not entirely clear which editions of Pikmin 1 & 2 are coming to Switch, with Nintendo only referring to them as "HD versions".

She then magically changed from her standard pink dress into something a little more dazzling, and the trailer ends.

Earlier this month, the FTC succeeded in getting a temporary ban placed on Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout bid. Now, ahead of an upcoming hearing regarding the agency's request for a preliminary injunction, the FTC has submitted further documentation on the matter.


In a new and heavily redacted filing, the FTC has refered back to Microsoft's acquisition of ZeniMax and Bethesda. The company stated Microsoft's decision to make ZeniMax games exclusive is "powerful evidence of incentive to foreclosure".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has released another patch for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor across PC and consoles. 


This patch addresses a variety of issues, including fixes for crashes and such. Your standard update fare. Additionally, this patch includes a fix for bounty hunting progression and introduces improved blaster handling.


However, the patch note that really caught my attention - "The training dummy on Jedha was sneaking around. It has now been immobilised". Sorry buddy, today marks the end of your sneaking adventures. You shall now remain tethered in place for all our Jedi training needs.

However, plenty of fans have been positively clamouring for their heavily rumoured arrival - and it looks like EA has finally relented, teasing they'll be coming very soon.


The Sims 4 developer Maxis has been on something of a fan-pleasing crusade of late; last year marked the long-awaited return of werewolves, for instance, alongside more robust options for Sims teens, while 2023 has bought babies back in a big way.

Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope received an extremely positive critical reception when it launched last October, with many praising the smart refinements it bought its predecessor's already wonderfully engaging strategic core.


Its commercial reception was far more muted, however; in an emergency investor call held at the start of the year to share news of its considerably lower-than- expected earnings, Ubisoft admitted it had been "surprised" by Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope's "underperformance in the final weeks of 2022 and early January".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has quietly updated its Final Fantasy racer Chocobo GP on Switch as a complete package.


Back in December, the company announced an end to "large scale updates" for the game nine months after its release. This included the removal of its in-game mythril shop (in January) used for microtransactions.



The game has an updated release date in the eShop (31st May 2023 in the UK store), seemingly related to the Chocobo GP Lite version of the game that no longer exists.

Blood in Baldur's Gate is a murder mystery which sets players the task of finding out who has killed an elf. The game takes place on a map of the lower part of Baldur's Gate, where players can select locations to visit and investigate.

Each day, players can vote on where to head next and whichever location gets the most votes will be made available. The game updates every weekday, and Larian has stated the game will run for the next three weeks.

This includes the game's split-screen multiplayer mode - a long-standing feature of the series since Pikmin 2 - and what looks like the ability for a second player to aid you in the game's main campaign via some kind of targeting reticule.


Environments shown off here appear to include the interior of a house - a dramatic departure for the series which has so far stayed outside (or underground). And yes, spoilers for Pikmin 1, the series is indeed set on Earth.

Discussing the show with CBC, Keighley acknowledged the all-male line-up on stage had been "a fair flag" for criticism, even if this had not originally been the intent. 


This is Us actress Melanie Liburd, who stars in Alan Wake 2 as its new co-protagonist, had been due to appear at one point, Keighley said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Next Fest, Valve's semi-regular celebration of gaming things to come, is back for another week of developer chats, livestreams, and an intimidating stack of "hundreds" of demos likely to thwart even the most committed completionist.


Proceedings are now firmly underway, continuing until next Monday 26th June, and Valve has provided a full list of available demos and livestreams for those eager to dive right in. But should decision paralysis strike, you'll find a few potentially promising places to start - based on some of the games Eurogamer has been harbouring mounting excitement for in recent times - below.


The list is far from exhaustive, of course, and all the games I've included are largely known quantities - it'll take a lot more poking around Valve's subterranean depths before Steam Next Fest's latest batch of hidden gems reveals itself. But in the meantime, while the poking continues, perhaps the following will provide some initial inspiration - and if anything catches your eye as you do your own deeper delving, feel free to share in the comments.

The glitch is relatively simple and requires a couple of weapons, some raw meat, and at least 57 Zonaite. It should be replicable in versions of the game up to 1.1.2, which is the version I tested it on and can confirm it works.

If you want a video guide to follow, the earliest video I can find of the glitch is from YouTube channel No Hypothesis. YouTuber Austin John Plays has a thorough guide too, in which he notes where things could go wrong.

Cavill was speaking at Netflix's Global Fan Event, Tudum over the weekend. There, the actor was joined on stage by fellow Witcher stars Freya Allan, Anya Chalotra, and Joey Batey to discuss the show's upcoming third season, which will apparently feature "a very shocking death". Also, those of us who have not read the books are going to be "blown away" by season three's "big bad". 


But, of course, what most people wanted to hear about was Cavill's departure from the show, something he announced towards the end of last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has revealed that the "significant majority" of players have yet to complete Diablo 4. 

That's according to Diablo 4's game director, Joe Shely, who confirmed on a recent fireside chat that whilst it may feel as though players are rocketing through the story campaign, the truth is that most players are taking their time, albeit "playing through content much more quickly".

"The significant majority of our players haven't finished the game yet," Shely said in the livestreamed discussion. "But many of the people who are watching this stream, and our dedicated players, play through content much more quickly and have been experiencing this situation with the dungeons."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The film studio behind the Super Mario Bros. Movie has moved to shut down reports it is making a Legend of Zelda film next.

Earlier this month, it was reported that animation studio Illumination was on the cusp of finalising a "big deal" with Nintendo to adapt its Legend of Zelda series. However, Illumination's CEO has now spoken out to damp down fan expectation.


Speaking to The Wrap, Chris Meledandri - who founded Illumination back in 2007 - said he didn't know where this Legend of Zelda report came from.

The original Moving Out arrived back in 2020, reimagining the process of furniture removals in much the same chaotic way Overcooked reimagined culinary creation. And while the end result wasn't "quite as good" as its obvious inspiration, as Eurogamer's Christian Donlan suggested in his review at the time, it was "still very special".


A extremely solid foundation, then, for more to come, and Moving Out 2 builds on the original by whisking the Furniture Arrangement and Relocation Technicians (F.A.R.Ts) "beyond the realms of their dimension" and into a succession of "wildly different" universes.

Not much has been heard from Houser since his departure from Rockstar following an "extended break", but rumblings of a return emerged last year when it was discovered he'd registered companies Absurd Ventures and Absurd Ventures in Games in both the US and UK.


And now, Houser's new project has been officially revealed, with Absurd Ventures being described as a media company with a focus on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium".

Booty shared the news in conversation with Axios, revealing all 23 of Microsoft's internal Xbox studios - aside from those specifically working on support for ongoing games like Minecraft and Sea of Thieves - have now "moved on to Gen 9". 


Despite that shift in focus, Booty says the company still plans to "maintain support" for Xbox One by making its Gen 9 titles - that is, games designed specifically for Xbox Series X/S - playable on the older platform via its cloud streaming technology.

The first Guacamelee (technically styled Guacamelee!, but the exclamation mark is a bit much), released in 2013, serving up a colourful mix of wrestling-inspired brawling and non-linear exploratory action, in which protagonist Juan Aguacate, suddenly infused with luchador powers, set out across a fantasy world inspired traditional Mexican culture and folklore to rescue El Presidente's kidnapped daughter.


"Like the best luchadores in the business," Eurogamer's Christian Donlan wrote at the time of its release, "Guacamelee has real heart and a blazing desire to put on a good show."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A logo seemingly pointing to an unannounced remaster of Square Enix's sci-fi action-RPG sequel Star Ocean: The Second Story has been discovered on the publisher's website.


The unassuming asset in question, found squirrelled away on Square Enix's support site (and which you can peruse at your leisure over on RPGSite), features a logo for a presumably unannounced title going by the name Star Ocean: The Second Story R.


While Square is yet to utter the name publicly, it's not hard to conclude it references an unannounced remaster, given it uses the same naming convention as Star Ocean: First Departure R. That game, which released for Switch and PlayStation in 2019, was a remaster of 1998 PlayStation Portable game Star Ocean: First Departure (itself a remaster of the 1996 Super Famicom original), introducing the likes of difficulty rebalancing and new character art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has nerfed dungeons in Diablo 4 to prevent players from XP farming.


Its latest hotfix, from 12th June, makes "further adjustments to elite monster density in dungeons".


A developer note adds: "We are standardising the density of elite monsters that spawn in dungeons to ensure that no particular dungeon is clearly more efficient to run through than others."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released, players have been flexing their creative muscles by building a host of weird and wacky designs. This has included mechs, trucks, tanks and Korok torture devices. Someone even built a pilotable T-rex, because why not.


A month on, however, these in-game designs have evolved even further, and we are seeing Zonai-crafted orchestras and functioning calculators turn up in the game. 


As a quick reminder, Link's new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects to create something completely new and unique.

Aired at 5am UK time, the 11-minute video offers little in the way of actual updates amongst its silliness. We get another trailer for the upcoming Shadows of the Damned Remastered and, right at the end, the sneakiest of peeks at what's next from renowned game maker Suda51.


Looking closely at the gameplay footage (which Suda51 pretends to block to stop us seeing more), there's a UI which shows health, blood and "emerald flowsion". One of the weapons equipped is named "Brynhildr".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times is beta testing a game called Connections which has gained attention for its similarities to a round featured in BBC2 quiz show Only Connect.


In both games, players are shown 16 clues which must be categorised into four groups of four. Once a category is correctly identified, the clues are grouped together at the top of the board and asasigned a colour.


The only notable difference is that Connections refreshes each day and players can only make four mistakes (akin to Wordle), whilst in the Connecting Wall (as it's known on Only Connect) players must solve the wall in two and a half minutes. Connecting Wall players have unlimited guesses until they've found two categories, after which they are only given three incorrect attempts.

This update sees the arrival of a redesigned in-game overlay, complete with new features, a notes function, pinnable in-game windows and improvements to notifications.


The ability to pin windows from the overlay means they appear on top of a game while you are still playing. This feature, the company has said, is available for Notes, Guides, Discussions, Achievements, and the web browser, so  is ideal for those "multi-tasking maniacs who love to have a movie on in the background while they game".

Speaking with Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation's head of subscriptions Nick Maguire said putting games on to the service "a bit later in the life cycle" is working for Sony. Therefore, this will "continue to be [its] strategy moving forward."


"We're happy with our strategy," Maguire told the publication. "Putting games in a bit later in the life cycle has meant that we can reach more customers 12, 18, 24 months after they have released."

When Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth was revealed at last week's Xbox Games Showcase, many (myself included) believed it was a completely new game being announced in the series, and not the sequel to 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon. 

However, following subtle rewording of its marketing for the game, RGG Studio and publisher Sega explained that Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is actually the title for Like a Dragon 8, which was initially announced under that name in September last year.

The test is open to Xbox Series X/S and PS5 players in North America, Latin America, Brazil, and Europe, but places are limited. Participants will be chosen at random from those who've registered on the Warner Bros. website, and registration is still open if you want to get involved.

Just when it looked like it would be all hands on deck until the arrival of Sea of Thieves' hugely anticipated (by me, I am the huge anticipant) Monkey Island crossover, developer Rare has announced it'll be reviving the multiplayer pirate game's limited-time Adventure series next week after a three-month absence.


Sea of Thieves' Adventures were introduced early last year in an effort to create meatier, more interesting monthly content drops, with the idea being each would form a playable instalment in an ongoing narrative. It's been fun following along, even if their quality has varied wildly (and even if they resulted in the sacrifice of moustachioed seahunk Arthur Pendragon, which is a crime I will never forgive), but then Rare suddenly announced it would be temporarily "hitting the pause button" on Adventures back in March.


Whatever the reason for the pause (presumably the impending arrival of a certain G-brush), Rare is finally ready to resume monthly Adventures, starting with next week's A Dark Deception, which runs from Thursday, 22nd June to Thursday, 6th July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People Can Fly, the studio behind Bullestorm and Ourtriders, has formally signed a work-for-hire agreement with Microsoft to develop a new project based on one of the Xbox maker's IP.


The announcement come via a statement posted to Polish financial site Interia Biznes, in which People Can Fly notes the game, which has been given the codename Project Maverick, will be fully funded by Microsoft with a budget of $30m-50m.


As to what the mystery project could be, the most obvious guess would be some form of new entry in the Gears of War series given the studio's previous connections with the franchise - it co-developed Gears of War: Judgment alongside its previous owner Epic Games in 2013, and was responsible for the Windows port of the original Gears of War prior to that.

"After the island's foolish king develops a remedy that ends up turning the population into monstrous creatures," the official announcement explains, "prophecies depicting a flame-headed hero begin to appear. As it so happens this beheaded hero is real, but saving a kingdom isn't on his schedule and he just wants to be left alone."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a year since Sony relaunched its PlayStation Plus subscription service with multiple tiers, and today there's word of an upcoming new feature: PS5 game streaming.


There's no release date as yet, just word that Sony is "testing" the technology for select PS5 titles, including those in the subscription's game catalogue, and others you may own. 


And to be clear, this will be a Premium tier benefit - so you won't get it if you're on regular old PlayStation Plus Essential or Extra.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I liked the look of Last Train Home when it got its unveiling this week during not-E3. It's a wintery period piece from Czech studio Ashborne Games, based on real events following World War 1. 


With the Great War over, you command a legion of Czech soldiers on a train bound for home via the Trans-Siberian railway. Their aim is to get back to the newly-created republic, but along the way there's trouble - the Russian Civil War.


Real-time battles are interspersed with management of your soldiers while aboard the train - which can of course be upgraded as you journey through Siberia - making sure your units are in good health and well fed.

"We wanted to create something that really resonated with a lot of people," Yoshida said previously. "And when we saw how Game of Thrones, and before that the Song of Ice and Fire series, has really resonated with players, we knew that this was something that we wanted to do as well."


The development team were required to watch the Game of Thrones Blu-ray boxset in order to keep the series' style front-of-mind - something that is now apparent more than ever. Did George RR Martin secretly pop over to the Square Enix office while writing lore sheets for Elden Ring?

A new trailer gives a look at the various ghost hunting tools that will be in our arsenal, including ouija boards, crucifixes and those blacklight glow stick things that I am sure have a proper name but I can't think of it right now. It is all suitably spooky, as you can see for yourself below.

"We've had some fun, but we wanted to make sure it felt authentic to the gothic, dark themes we had. And because of that, there's no secret level in Diablo 4 that people might be looking for, as per previous games."

The FTC had previously set its own date for the deal to be debated by an internal administrative judge on 2nd August - after Microsoft's own deadline to complete the merger on 18th July expires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest's live showcase might have struggled to consistently entertain with its saggy middle and excessive runtime, but the overall season-wide event has apparently already done what it needed to - producer Geoff Keighley has now confirmed Summer Game Fest will return next year, live showcase and all.


Summer Game Fest is currently in its fourth consecutive year - having initially started amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as a response to major in-person gaming events being shut down - and 2023's offering has been bigger than ever.


It was, of course, originally expected to have some competition from the returning E3 this year, but after that show's cancellation, Summer Game Fest swelled to fill the gap, hoovering up a number of publisher showcases and events under the Summer Game Fest banner.

PowerWash Simulator's SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack was announced back in May but, beyond its Bikini Bottom setting, developer FuturLab didn't give much away.


Now, though, with a release in sight, the studio is finally ready to share more, confirming its Spongebob DLC will feature a mini campaign split across six new maps: Conch Street, The Bikini Bottom Bus, The Krusty Krab, The Patty Wagon, The Invisible Boatmobile, and The Mermalair.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long old wait for developer Slow Bros' gorgeous stop-motion-style space adventure Harold Halibut - but now, some seven years after its initial reveal, an end is in almost sight, with its Xbox, PlayStation, and PC release set for "early" next year.


Harold Halibut tells the story of a young lab assistant (the Harold of the title) forced to live his life onboard the Fedora, a city sized spaceship still submerged beneath an alien ocean 250 years after it fled Earth to preserve the human race.


While some of its inhabitants have reconciled themselves to a life on the sunken ship, others still works tirelessly to find a way to leave the planet and reach a new, dryer home. Harold's story lies somewhere between all that, told in absolutely sumptuous style, part fully voiced stop-motion movie, part narrative-driven adventure.

The Lamplighters League unfolds in an alternative version of the 1930s, where players - taking control of the titular organisation's gang of misfits and scoundrels - travel the world in an effort to thwart the Banished Court cult's nefarious schemes.


It's an adventure that'll swoop from dockyards and other urban corners to far more exotic locales, including deserts and jungles. Here, players must battle the Banished Court's army using a mix of real-time infiltration, stealth, turn-based tactical combat, and team management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tango Gameworks' sublime rhythm-action adventure Hi-Fi Rush is getting a great bit dollop of free new content on 5th July, including two new modes, new photo mode features, and more.


Everything included in Hi-Fi Rush's new Arcade Challenge update (as it's officially known) will only be available after beating the base game. Once that's done, a new arcade cabinet is added to the hideout, unlocking the new BPM Rush and Power up! Tower up! modes.


BPM Rush presents players with a series of encounters where the beat gets faster and faster as enemies are defeated, gradually rising all the way up to 200BPM. Tango notes that while this new addition is really designed for players in search of a tougher challenge, it'll actually feature an Easy and Casual difficulty setting too so everyone can give it a try.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed heavy metal rhythm shooter Metal: Hellsinger is taking a tilt toward pop in its new Essential Hits Pack DLC, which launches today on Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


Metal: Hellsinger's FPS action, if you've not yet made its acquaintance, sees players traversing eight musically infused Hells, armed with a blade and an appropriately devastating assortment of guns. The twist, though, is enemies take way more damage when an attack lands on the beat, turning its demon slaughter into wonderfully satisfying dance of bullets and steel.


To date, all music in Metal: Hellsinger and its earlier DLC has been firmly in the realm of heavy metal and written specifically for the game. However, its newly revealed Essential Hits Pack DLC sets its sights on a different crowd, taking things in a poppier direction with eight licensed tracks that can replace the base game's existing tunes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're back to wrap up the end of a tiring but intriguing week of Summer Game Fest and not-E3 announcements, which offered us the usual mixed bag of presentations, CG trailers, and the occaisonal musical interlude.

What were our favourites? There was a real variety of things on offer, from Dont Nod's Jusant and Compulsion's stylish-looking South of Midnight to blockbusters like Star Wars Outlaws and Fable. And then, of course, there was the inescapable Starfield - which after nearly a full hour deep dive I still feel like we've only seen a small portion.
Microsoft did well, I thought. Ubisoft did pretty good. Capcom... put in an appearance to delay Pragmata. But what were our favourite games on offer, and how convinced were we by Todd Howard's marketing spiel? Joining me to discuss all that are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

But while Nix is adorable and I've taken to calling him my land axolotl, the character that really caught the internet's attention was a certain droid commando, ND-5. Twitter, Tumblr, I've seen you.
The reactions to ND-5 I've seen are mostly "friends, please don't be horny for the Star Wars droid" or "friends, I am horny for the Star Wars droid". You either get it or you don't. So please, let me at least try to explain why the internet is horny for the Star Wars droid.

Speaking via an investor call held in the wake of today's announcement that it would restructure the company, Embracer's newly-promoted interim exec Matthew Karch said the business must now prioritise pumping out Lord of the Rings projects ahead of other game ideas which might not perform as well. 


"We own Lord of the Rings, and we know we need to be exploiting Lord of the Rings in a very significant fashion and turning that into one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world," Karch said. "And that's obviously something we're going to be doing.

Booty appeared on the Giant Bomb podcast with Xbox boss Phil Spencer to discuss the Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct.


"We have an awful lot of people internally playing it," said Booty. "Working with Todd and the team, I see bug counts and just by the numbers, if it shipped today, this would have the fewest bugs that any game from Bethesda has ever shipped with."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioWare has removed a bizarre statue of Mass Effect's dying Commander Shepard from its online store, following fan confusion and upset.
The statue appeared on the BioWare Gear Store yesterday, and features (yes, you guessed it) the dead female body of Commander Shepard floating around in space as seen in the opening to Mass Effect 2. The statue was priced at $135 and its store page stated only 2000 would be available worldwide.
Needless to say, a statue suddenly being sold that depicts a dying character is a bit odd to begin with. The posing of FemShep is also a bit much - why the slightly arched back? Out of context, it looks a bit like Shepard's death is being sexualised and fetishised. And why only FemShep? What about if I want a statue of male Shepard limply floating about?

These story missions will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Gothenburg, with each location featuring "massive maps" and "complex objectives". Players will find themselves taking on the series' Null Sector group, with the story set to continue in future seasons of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer has announced a "comprehensive restructuring program" which will result in studio closures, project cancellations and job losses.


The Swedish umbrella company has grown enormously through acquisitions over the past five years, and now owns a swathe of studios such as Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics, Borderlands maker Gearbox, rights to franchises such as The Lord of the Rings, and an array of other publishers such as Plaion, Saber and THQ Nordic.


But while amassing its empire, Embracer is yet to see a big return. Last year's big bet, its Saints Row reboot, was a critical and commercial failure. More recently, the company suffered a body blow when a major unannounced $2bn deal fell through, prompting its shares to plummet by an eye-watering 40 percent.

Ghost Trick, if you're unfamiliar, comes from Ace Attorney designer Shu Takumi and follows the adventures of Sissel, a sharp-dressing amnesiac who's surprised to wake up extremely and unequivocally dead at the start of the game.


On the plus side, Sissel's quickly learns his newfound spirit form grants him the ability to possess inanimate objects, enabling him to influence events and, in gameplay terms, progress to the next portion of Ghost Trick's wonderfully told story.

The mysterious project was first announced with a bizarre teaser back in 2020, when it was set for a futuristic-sounding 2022 launch. A year later, that release date was pushed back to 2023. And now, in 2023, it has been further delayed - this time, to a year unknown.


Tonight, during the Capcom Showcase, the publisher confirmed we'd need to wait longer once more - though we did get another teaser beforehand. You can watch that below:

Redfall released to a less-than-stellar reception back in May, with Digital Foundry calling the Xbox version a "sad tale of unfulfilled potential and profound technical issues", while its PC counterpart was so hampered by poor performance, technical problems, and bugs, Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia said there was the sense it "just isn't finished".


Launch was bad enough that Xbox boss Phil Spencer took the step of apologising to players, admitting, "We let a lot of people down this week", leaving many to wonder how - and if - Arkane Austin could turn things around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly set to file an injunction with a federal court in an effort to temporarily halt Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


The FTC sued to block Microsoft's proposed deal back in December, claiming it would allow the company to suppress its games industry competition. The hearing for that case - which will be deliberated by the FTC's own internal administrative law judge - is set for 2nd August, after Microsoft's 18th July merger deadline expires.


As reported by CNBC, citing a source familiar with the matter, the FTC is now taking steps to prevent Microsoft's Activision Blizzard deal from going ahead before its internal hearing can take place, by filing for an injunction with a US District Court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XDefiant, Ubisoft's upcoming Tom-Clancy-inspired free-to-play shooter, is holding its first Open Session test later this month on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.


XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division - was initially announced as Tom Clancy's XDefiant back in 2021, but Ubisoft chose to drop the Tom Clancy branding after criticism from fans that felt its flamboyant action strayed too far from the franchise's more serious military themes and formula.


Development has quietly continued since then, with Ubisoft occasionally opening XDefiant up to registered "insiders" to canvas feedback, and a recent closed beta finally brought the game into the hands of a much broader audience, with over 1m players ultimately getting to spend some time with its first-person shooting action.

We began with a look at Assassin's Creed Nexus, which is due to launch for Meta Quest 2. Tonight provided our first real detail of the game, including the fact it will star three of the series' best-loved protagonists: Ezio, Kassandra and Connor.


Nexus will boast a "full single-player campaign", Ubisoft said, with an Abstergo-set modern day threat revolving around the evil tech company trying to use people's memories to sway their behaviour - and even their voting preferences. It's perhaps a bold choice of narrative for a game set to be played on Mark Zuckerburg-branded hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft's delayed movie tie-in from The Division developer Massive Entertainment, will release on 7th December. 


Accompanying this news, Ubisoft shared a gameplay overview trailer for the upcoming release. It transports us to the franchise's never-before-seen Western Frontier, and covers things such as skill upgrades, mounts (you will be able to tame your own banshee) and introduces some of the game's new Na'vi clans. 


It all looks rather Far Cry (our Na'vi has weapons training) with a dash of Horizon Forbidden West, if you ask me, but I will let you judge for yourself below.

Shadow Gambit's top-down tactical action - which should be immediately familiar to fans of Mimimi Games' previous titles - unfolds in a "dynamic, immersive sandbox" given an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. It sees players climbing board their living ghost ship, The Red Marley, to explore the Caribbean in an alternative version of the Golden Age of Piracy.


As they set out in search of the legendary Captain Mordechai's lost treasure, with the Inquisition of the Burning Maiden in pursuit, they'll gradually acquire a crew of cursed pirates with supernatural powers that can be assembled into teams for use in missions around the world.

We likely know the full schedule for tonight, with two just-revealed titles set to get a more thorough showing. Those, of course, are Star Wars Outlaws from Division studio Massive, unveiled last night at Xbox Games Showcase, and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which we got a glimpse of at Summer Game Fest. 


It's a Ubisoft show, so there'll be some Assassin's Creed. We're looking forward to seeing more of the upcoming back-to-basics Mirage, and potentially some of VR game Nexus and Ancient China-set mobile entry Jade. Then there's likely to be Forza Horizon-like The Crew Motorfest, plus the latest release date for Skull and Bones.

Hazel is a Weaver, a "magical mender of broken bonds and spirits". Compulsion has described her as "outwardly confident, wisecracking, and actively on the hunt". Hazel is also Black, something that narrative producer and creative specialist James Lewis lamented is "unfortunately... still pretty unique for video games". 


Thankfully, the South of Midnight developer has ensured its Black heroine was created by Black women and women of colour, calling this inclusion "key for understanding and writing Hazel's voice."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14889">New research</a> suggests that AIs can produce perfectly secure steganographic images:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Steganography is the practice of encoding secret information into innocuous content in such a manner that an adversarial third party would not realize that there is hidden meaning. While this problem has classically been studied in security literature, recent advances in generative models have led to a shared interest among security and machine learning researchers in developing scalable steganography techniques. In this work, we show that a steganography procedure is perfectly secure under Cachin (1998)&#8217;s information theoretic-model of steganography if and only if it is induced by a coupling. Furthermore, we show that, among perfectly secure procedures, a procedure is maximally efficient if and only if it is induced by a minimum entropy coupling. These insights yield what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography algorithms to achieve perfect security guarantees with non-trivial efficiency; additionally, these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical validation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three modern baselines&#8212;arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping&#8212;using GPT-2, WaveRNN, and Image Transformer as communication channels. We find that the minimum entropy coupling-based approach achieves superior encoding efficiency, despite its stronger security constraints. In aggregate, these results suggest that it may be natural to view information-theoretic steganography through the lens of minimum entropy coupling...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Microsoft Flight Simulator head Jorg Neumann initially spoke of the studio's plans to support the 2020 version of the sim for a decade back in 2019, a year prior to its release, and it's a stance that's been reiterated intermittently ever since. As such, there was much confusion among fans following last night's Xbox Games Showcase reveal of a standalone sequel for 2024 - particularly as Neumann had already hinted at some of its flagship new features, including cargo delivery jobs, in relation to the current sim.


Now though, in an effort to quell confusion and de-escalate mounting controversy, Neumann has offered clarification on continued support for the 2020 release in a FAQ posted on the Flight Simulator website, beginning with the reiteration that Flight Simulator 2024 is a "standalone simulator and the next-generation sequel" and not an update for the existing game.

Ebenezer Scrooge and the Invisible World is a side-scrolling platform adventure with something of a Doctor Who Christmas special to it, while the art style gives me vibes of Forgotton Anne. 


Scrooge - acting here as the protagonist and good guy - must jump and fight his way across London to fight wealthy industrialist Caspar Malthus, a press release reveals, using "a team of spectral allies" to fight Malthus' own private guard.

The games can be found by visiting Capcom Town, a website set up specifically for the anniversary and which was first teased back in March.

The site acts as a hub for all the different franchises Capcom owns, and you can hover over all the pins to find links to websites for each. There's also plenty of Capcom's most famous characters dotted around - I'm particularly enjoying watching Jill Valentine strolling around in horror as she's followed by Nemesis and his huge rocket launcher.

The team has dubbed this stage as "chaotic", and I can understand why. This level will see players coming face to face with "seemingly endless corridors, flying paintings" and, my personal favourite, "a gameshow-like spinning wheel that triggers random events". 


There is also a new pick up known as GoldFinger, and if you didn't read that and immediately start singing Shirley Bassey then, I am sorry, but I am not sure we can remain friends. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.

This is the project previously referred to internally as Project Belfry, and was revealed in the Xbox Games Showcase last night as coming from both Stoic and Xbox Game Studios. The suggestion is it won't be coming to other consoles. 


After some new apocalypse razes humanity's cities, survivors accumulate in the Belfry, a towering windmill that looks like something from the Moomins.

On Xbox Series X, it will run at 4K resolution. On Xbox Series S, it will run at 1440p. 


Speaking to IGN, Howard said Starfield sometimes ran at 60fps in development on console, but that Bethesda had taken the decision to lock its framerate because "we prefer the consistency".


"I think it'll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for," Howard said. "Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen."

In a post-event roundtable in Los Angeles attended by Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell, Booty said that Microsoft's output was entering a new era.


"We had some gaps last year, but I think we've turned the corner coming into 2023," Booty said. "[I] feel very good about launching Hi-Fi Rush, we have Minecraft Legends out there which is doing well, we have Age of Empires continuing to come to console... and then as we saw today, this fall we have Forza Motorsport and Starfield."

This particular Sleeper has been hiding out in the Starward Belt at the edge of the Helion System, and, having rewritten their own code in an effort to escape servitude, is now on the run with a malfunctioning body, a bounty on their head, and no memory of their past.

There were the steampunk machines, the gleaming statues and overhead skyrails, the alternate history Americana. The first-person visuals and chunky golden guns didn't help things either. 


But no, this is the completely legally distinct Clockwork Revolution, from Wasteland 3 developer InXile Entertainment, and this "vibrant steam-powered metropolis" is named Avalon.

Publisher Paradox Interactive officially unveiled the sequel back in March, calling it a "revolutionary" spin on the acclaimed 2015 original and the "most open-ended city-building sandbox on the planet". Other than talk of a "fully-realised transport and economy systems", however, specifics remained pretty thin.


Courtesy of tonight's Xbox Games Showcase, though, we've now had our first proper look at Cities: Skylines 2 in action, with Colossal Order showing off a sequel that notably ramps up the realism, in terms of visuals at least.

CDPR describes Phantom Liberty as a "spy-thriller", with Reeves telling us to expect "twists, secrets and plenty of stuff to do". Here is the official trailer for Cyberpunk 2077's expansion.

Anyway, continuing this theme, Life is Strange developer Don't Nod's new Jusant looks absolutely stellar.


It's a sci-fi climbing game, by the looks of it, in which a young hero climbs endless mountain walls with a funny little creature for company. There looks to be puzzling, interaction with mountain communities, a range of surfaces to climb on, and a sprinkling of futuristic stuff. And at one point you ride a mushroom.


The sense of place - and the lighting, cor - is just wonderful. And the game's due out in 2023. Cannot wait for this one.

The video announced that after Appalachia had welcomed 15 million dwellers, Atlantic City beckons. New Jersey's pleasure city was invoked with a lot of gambling imagery and a neat riff on one of Springsteen's greatest songs, which I enjoyed at least.


Not much else to say at the moment, but the game is "coming soon". If you get a chance, do dust off Nebraska, which is one of the Boss' finest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Like a Dragon game has just been announced at Xbox Games Showcase. This time, starring Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga called Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. 
I'm not sure what's happening, neither is Ichiban, but the trailer and title of the game are exactly the kind of frivolous fun we've come to expect from the Like a Dragon series. The trailer shows a very naked Ichiban waking up on a beach somewhere in America. I don't know either, pals.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is slated for an early 2024 release on Xbox and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years of furiously willing it into existence has paid off! Monkey Island is finally FINALLY coming to Sea of Thieves in a major story crossover starting on 20th July this year.


It's not a complete surprise, of course; Rare first teased a Monkey Island crossover for Sea of Thieves back in 2021, tucked in a tiny corner of the game's Pirates of the Caribbean adventure. And now self-proclaimed mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood and friends will be getting similar treatment across three brand-new Tall Tales.


Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island - as the crossover is officially known - begins on Mêlée Island, where Threepwood is inexplicably receiving adulation from his peers. What follows is a "love-letter to the classic adventure game" that'll feature a host of familiar faces, including Murray, LeChuck, and more.

It's like Asobo sat down and brainstormed every use for a plane that's not just flying from A to B, and worked to put it in Microsoft Flight Sim. The list is frankly astonishing, and includes:


Aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, air ambulance, crop dusting, mountain rescue, skydive aviation, aerial construction, cargo transport, VIP charter service, air racing, glider pilot, scientific research, low altitude training, experimental trips, executive transport service, airship tours and hot air balloon trips.

The developer behind Spiritfarer and Sundered has been working on 33 Immortals, a top-down action-RPG roguelite with a delicate hand-painted art style and co-op for 33 players. What?!


It looks like a fascinating piece of work, with a delicate, rather serious tone, sonorous choral music, and delicate animation. But also: 33 players in an action-RPG! Based on a bit of gameplay, 33 Immortals won't scrimp when it comes to throwing loads of enemies your way, and there was a lovely bullet hell element to some of the spells going off.


33 Immortals will be released in 2024 for Xbox X/S, and will appear day one on Game Pass.

A CGI trailer showed a bounty hunter-stuffed trailer starring a smuggler character named Kay. What we saw offered just a glimpse, but it was very, very Star Wars.


Cue scenes with Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters, people frozen in carbonite, and at least one Hutt.

"This is a brand new classic Sonic Game that's been developed," Iizuka-san said, via translator, "and in order to recreate that classic Sonic gameplay, we needed someone who understands the classic Sonic series and understands that gameplay format, in order to really execute well on the final product."
"And so we're working together, with Naoto Ohshima-san, who is the creator of Sonic the Hedgehog and was there at Sonic 1, creating and developing the game. We're working with Ooshima-san and his team at Arzest, they're leading development on the title and they're doing a great job of making a brand new classic Sonic game."

Exactly how soon, however, seems to depend on the ongoing writer's strike which has shutdown much of Hollywood.


"We're in the midst of this writers' strike, and so everything has been paused and on hold for the right reasons," Pratt told Entertainment Tonight.

The game's official website confirms there will be a disc-based version in Asia - though only for PlayStation consoles, allowing PS4 copies to be played on PS5 consoles with disc drives. For the game's PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S formats, "no physical edition will be released". 


Outside of Asia, the situation is less clear. Local versions of the official website for the UK and USA omit any mention of a physical release, and simply point to digital storefronts for the game on all formats - PC, PlayStation and Xbox.

Now, Ubisoft has revealed a further option that nods all the way back to Assassin's Creed 1 (which, I'm slightly alarmed to acknowledge, is now nearing its 16th birthday).


Where Mirage's colour palette is all golden sunrays and splashes of crimson, the original AC1 had a much bluer filter. To me, it pointed to the fact your historical adventures were all just a simulation - similar to the green palette employed in The Matrix films.

The bug, which Niantic previously told Eurogamer was an "unfortunate technical error", was eventually fixed by the developer only after fans worked to crowdsource data and diagnose the problem for themselves.


It was the latest in a string of issues which seem to regularly affect the hugely-successful mobile app, with the  release of Pokémon and the launch of in-game events frequently marred by some problem or other - particularly in early timezones such as New Zealand and Australia, where it is now a running joke in the game's community that players act as unofficial beta testers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blasphemous 2, the sequel to developer The Game Kitchen gorgeously grim 2019 action-platformer, finally has a release date and is heading to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC on 24th August this year.


Like its enormously enjoyable predecessor, Blasphemous 2 is part Metroidvania, part Souls-like, marrying a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling imagery.


Blasphemous 2 sees the return of pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One in an adventure set across a unfamiliar land - a labyrinthine new kingdom promising a "series of enchantingly grotesque landscapes", and ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

Released all the way back in 2013, Payday 2 sees teams of up to four players turning to a life of crime, embarking on a career of increasingly outlandish heists across Washington DC.


Payday 2's development officially ceased at the end of 2018, amid financial difficulties for Overkill's parent company Starbreeze, but the game recieved a surprise resurrection the following year, and updates of various sizes have continued to release since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to last night's Summer Game Fest opening livestream, which offered us a first look at new Sonic and Prince of Persia games, plus a mouth-watering glimpse at Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth.

What didn't we see? A little oddly, Square Enix decided not to showcase Final Fantasy 16 - the one which actually goes on sale in a couple of weeks. Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty was also missing, as was host Geoff Keighley's best pal Hideo Kojima. Once the conference concluded, discussion online focused on the lack of any women on stage, following appearances by a string of male developers - and also Nic Cage.
On the upside, no one unexpectedly walked on stage and got arrested. So, how do we feel about all that, and how would we rate the conference overall? Was it a satisfying alternative to E3? Or are we hoping for more now from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom over the coming days? Joining me to discuss all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

Nate, you see, is unemployed and lives with his parents, spending his time nestled in front of the television until he's sucked into a fantasy world inside the screen.

But those that stuck around post-Keighley were, as is fast becoming tradition, rewarded with another batch of intriguing indie titles, courtesy of this year's Day of the Devs stream - and if you missed it, the whole thing can be perused in one convenient, easily digestible round-up below.

Beastieball

Beastieball is a new RPG from Wishes Unlimited, the studio behind the acclaimed Wondersong and Chicory. This time around, the team is turning its attention to what looks something like Pokémon with its combat replaced by a strategic, turn-based take on volleyball. It sees players, in the role of a coach, touring the world and signing up Beasties they encounter to join their team and take on rivals in bouts of Beastieball. Loads of Beasties are promised, and they can all form friendships that'll create unique combos for use in matches. This one might still be a little way off, though - a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign launches soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 cult action adventure Shadows of the Damned is getting a remaster, developer Grasshopper Manufacture has announced. 


More details on the project - and further reveals - will come next week in a dedicated Grasshopper Direct livestream. Yes, another one. 


If you missed Shadows of the Damned at the time, it's a slightly silly demon shooter written by Goichi "Suda51" Suda, back from around the same time as Lollipop Chainsaw (a remaster of which was previously confirmed for launch this year).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the hubbub of the Summer Geoffs, Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have given a fresh look at Warhammer: Space Marine 2, showing of a slice of co-op campaign gameplay ahead of its arrival this "winter".


Announced during last year's The Game Awards, Space Marine 2 expands on the third-person shoot-and-slash template of the Relic Entertainment developed original, which released all the way back in 2011. It sees the return of the first game's protagonist, Captain Titus (albeit with a new voice actor), and a new threat in the form of the Tyranids.


One of Space Marine 2's big new features, not previously revealed, is the ability to play its main campaign either solo or in three-player co-op mode either with two friends of AI. And we've not been given a glimpse of that courtesy of its newly revealed Summer Game Fest trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horror movie legend John Carpenter is teaming up with Saber Interactive for Toxic Commando, a co-op FPS promising '80's vibes, action, humour, and horror' when it launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime next year.


Toxic Commando's action unfolds somewhere in the "near future", in a world where a failed experiment to harness the power of the Earth's core has unleashed an Eldritch abomination known as the Sludge God, intent on "turning soil to scum and the living to undead monsters".


Enter the Toxic Commandos, or, more specifically, up to four players, who'll each need to select a class to suit their playstyle. From there, it's a case of grabbing a weapon (firearms, grenades, even a katana), then tackling the mutant hordes on-foot or from behind the wheel of a vehicle.

Will Arnett, who is voicing Sweet Tooth in this adaptation, introduced the new trailer, which sees Anthony Mackie squaring off with the series' clown-faced killer in an arcade. Actually, maybe those are slot machines. 


It's all pretty awkward, if I am honest. Sweet Tooth pushes Mackie's John Doe up against a cabinet and makes him sing along with him as the two share back and forth quips. But, it is what it is, as you can see for yourself below.

A bunch of heroes investigate an ancient temple, Fishstick does the Lara Croft emote roll, there are vines that are also grind rails and rideable velociraptor mounts. It's basically everything you could want.


Then Optimus Prime turns up, things go wrong, and at the very end the big reveal is... Slone is back! SLONE IS BACK!

Brode described Conquest mode as "a great way to get a super competitive experience". The mode was announced recently, and seems to hinge on competing against the same opponent multiple times, draining their health with each win. It won't replace the standard game mode, but will provide another option.


Marvel Snap's a brilliant collectible card game for smartphones and PC. It's got some genuinely brilliant cards in it and loads of fascinating design ideas. Do check it out.

Sand Land's set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply. When lawlessness breaks out over rising water costs, a sheriff approaches some local demons to strike a bargain.


What this means from the game's reveal is an action game set in what looks like a large open world. Players explore in everything from hoverbikes to tanks and even on the backs of dinosaurs. There's elaborate futuristic weaponry and fast third-person combat. It's enlivened by lovely comic visual design and an art style that recalls things like Borderlands, with visible pen lines on characters and the landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If it's weird crossovers you want, how about Street Fighter obots smashing against killer dinos? Because that's what Capcom's offering in its newly announced Exoprimal collaboration.


Exoprimal is, of course, Capcom's new squad-based multiplayer shooter, in which teams of five, adorned in ridiculously over-the-top mech-style armour known as Exosuits, take on hordes of dinosaurs, from swarming raptors to marauding T. rexes.


And that's where Capcom's Street Fighter 6 collaboration comes in, with a bunch of familiar faces from the long-running franchise dropping into Exoprimal in the form of stylised Exosuits.

Along with the newly announced Prince of Persia game, we were swiftly treated to a look at Mortal Kombat 1. This included gameplay, so expect plenty of blood and gore. I am talking about decapitations, saws to the face, spinal cord removal. You know, kind of what you'd expect from the famously brutal fighter series. 


Here is that trailer. Maybe put any food you were eating to one side before diving in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gun Interactive has announced an end for Friday the 13th: The Game, confirming the asymmetrical multiplayer horror will be pulled from stores on 31st December this year, the same day its Friday the 13th licence officially expires.


Friday the 13th: The Game has been around since 2017, and, despite a rocky start, proved to be a solidly entertaining - and commercially successful - horror experience. Unfortunately, its development was forced to end prematurely in 2018 amid a lawsuit relating to the ownership of the Friday the 13th licence, and 2020 bought the news Gun would be decommissioning the game's dedicated servers, reverting to the peer-to-peer networking favoured at launch.


Since then, with no new content in development, Friday the 13th: The Game has largely remained out of the spotlight, but, now, Gun has confirmed - in a statement shared on Twitter - the game'll no longer be available to purchase, either digitally or physically, once its licence expires on 31st December 2023. There's some small solace for owners, however, in that the developer says the game will remain playable through "at least" 31st December 2024.

It begins at 8pm UK time (9pm CEST / 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT) and you can watch the stream here while we report live on what we see. I'm sure you know the drill by now, but this is a chance for us to follow the announcements together and talk about whether we're impressed by them. Will we be?
What is on the cards for tonight, then - what should we expect? Well, Geoff Keighley, obviously, because it's his show. But in terms of head-turning games: Ed Boon will be there to show Mortal Kombat 1, the franchise reboot, and Remedy's Sam Lake will be there to show more of Alan Wake 2.

In a minute-long video, Goldberg explained how excited she was to play Diablo 4, which she called her "favourite game" series, on her Apple computer, which she called her "favourite gaming system". 

"I know there's a lot of terrible things happening in the world, but what I'm about to tell you is not on any scale like that," Goldberg said. Indeed, it's not quite as grim as seeing Diablo 4's billboard advert against the backdrop of wildfires, or Activision Blizzard CCO Lulu Cheng Meservey assuring us the company has "no affiliation or partnership" with said natural disaster. But you know what they say - an Apple a day keeps the demons away. Or something like that.

Gaiden was first announced in September last year, when it was described as a more compact return to the action gameplay of previous games in the series. Plot-wise, the game will follow series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and explain what happened to him in the gap between Yakuza 6 and Like a Dragon 8.

Back in September, Gaiden was teased with a release date at some point this year. Now, it seems the game will launch in November, according to data scraped by website PS Deals (thanks, Gematsu).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Kojima Productions have released a new trailer for their Hideo Kojima documentary, which is said to promise a "creative journey into the mind of a video games icon".  


Known as Connecting Worlds, this documentary will provide us with a "rare insight" into Kojima's creative process, with the likes of Norman Reedus - currently working with Kojima on Death Stranding's sequel DS2 - and filmmaker Guillermo del Toro contributing to the upcoming production.


In a short trailer, which you can see below, Reedus likens working with Kojima to "stepping into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory with Willy Wonka".  Meanwhile, on screen text proclaims Kojima as being "widely regarded as the first auteur of video games". From what I can tell, this documentary will cover Kojima's experience founding Kojima Productions as well as his creative process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the summer heat is getting to you, here is something that will cool you down a bit - Lake, the cosy postal game, is getting a wintery and festive DLC.


Appropriately titled Season's Greetings, this DLC will act as a prequel taking place nine months before the main story of Lake. This time, players will take on the role of Thomas Weiss, father of Lake's protagonist Meredith Weiss, as he goes about his days delivering mail to the residents of Providence Oaks, while readying himself for a visit from his daughter. 


Lake developer Gamious promises more of the same cosy and relaxing gameplay in Season's Greetings, with the addition of new characters as well as some familiar faces. There will also be the chance to find answers to some of those lingering questions players still have from the main game - though the developer stopped short of spoiling any specifics. You can see a short trailer for Season's Greetings below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Horror, the Junji-Ito-inspired roguelike RPG from developer Paweł Koźmiński, leaves PC early access on 19th October and releases for PlayStation and Switch on the same day.


World of Horror initially launched into PC early access a little over three years ago, and its deliciously nasty tale of a seaside town beseiged by malevolent cosmic forces - which players must investigate over the course of five randomly selected mysteries each playthrough - has slowly expanded with new stories, events, and features since then.


If you've not yet hopped onboard World of Horror's early access, the whole thing plays out something like a 1-bit version of the board game Arkham Horror, albeit with Lovecraftian overtones traded for something closer to Junji Ito's distinct brand of the mundane run amok - so think high school terror, haunted bulletin board systems, and so on.

As its name suggests, Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine turns the spotlight on Super meat Boy villain Dr. Fetus who, this time around, is aiming to create the perfect clone of Meat Boy - a process requiring him to eliminate all the rubbish clones first.


And so enter the Mean Meat Machine, a terrifying contraption that sees malformed clones dropping in at the top and then falling en masse to the bottom, wending their way past an array of deadly devices as they go, including chainsaws, missiles, and lasers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ThroughLine Games, the studio behind the acclaimed Forgotton Anne, has unveiled Forgotlings, an equally gorgeous "spiritual sequel" that's just launched a Kickstarter campaign.


Forgotlings, like its predecessor, takes place in a "magical realm inhabited by things we have lost and forgotten", where sentient creatures - the Forgotlings - live in search of a purpose.


However, despite its shared universe, Forgotlings looks to be something of a new beginning in both story and gameplay terms. It casts players as Fig, a "gifted posing doll", thrust into a world caught in a conflict between five mighty tribes. Fig will need to unite each tribe to save the world from destruction at the hands of an "enigmatic Beast".

Dimension Shellshock promises to bring fans an "all-new adventure" introducing the Ninja Turtles' occasional ally Miyamoto Usagi, who originally made the jump from his own Usagi Yojimbo comicbook series into the turtles' world back in 1987.


Alongside its new playable character (the announcement trailer teases new playable "characters" but doesn't elaborate further), Dimension Shellshock also includes a mysterious new game mode, alternative colour palette options, plus new music composed by Tee Lopes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first major Counter-Strike 2 update has arrived since the game launched as a limited test in March, bringing with it a radical new loadout system, new buy mechanics and - finally! - a new map for testing purposes, Mirage. 
The loadout system has the potential to be the most disruptive change, as you can now choose five each of pistols, rifles and "mid-tier" (SMG/shotgun) weapons to take into a match. Previously, weapons like the silenced and unsilenced M4 were assigned to the same category, so you would have to go without one of them - but here, you could sacrifice one of the less-used rifles to have both options available. This change has been requested by players for a long time, and would also make it easier for developers Valve to add new weapons in the future, so it's a big win in my book. 
When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first appeared more than a decade ago, it sported a radial buy menu designed to mesh nicely to gamepad controls - after all, the game was originally intended to buy a console-focused iteration of the franchise. That menu has been replaced in the new Counter-Strike 2 update, in favour of a simpler grid-based buy menu that shows your teammate's purchases. Crucially, it's now possible to refund unused weapons, armour and grenades before buy time expires at the start of each round, saving you from the ignoble fate of spending all your hard-earned cash on a weapon you bought accidentally - always a pain given the importance of Counter-Strike's round-to-round economy system.

In an blog update today, the publisher acknowledged it had been a while since many pre-orders had been placed. Three years later, Bloodlines 2 still does not have a release date.


Paradox said it was still "dedicated to delivering" a great game, but that it was now updating its various editions and bonus content. "With the bonus content being updated, the prior physical edition offered items that are no longer representative of the game," it explained. As such, the publisher said it was offering refunds in order to "provide the best value".

While elder dragon Amatsu was originally supposed to bring Sunbreak's story to a close in April's Ver. 15 update, Capcom says it decided to squeeze one last surprise in for players after it identified a few additional features it wanted to include.


As such, Sunbreak owners will face a final, formidable challenge when tomorrow's free Title Update 6 (AKA Ver. 16) arrives, bringing the expansion's story to a close with a battle against the Primordial Malzeno, revealing more on its relationship with the Kingdom. The fight - which features new moves compared to the original version of Malzeno - will be available to hunters at Master Rank 10 and above, and includes materials needed to craft new weapons and armour.

As a quick reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release on PC back in March. However, in a bizarre series of events, it transpired that Fntastic had failed to trademark the game's name, which had since been contested by the company behind a calendar app. All traces of the game were subsequently removed from Steam.


Talking to WellPlayed, Fntastic has now provided a small update on this trademark debacle, stating it believes "power is in the truth".

That was all well and good, and because I don't know when to leave well enough alone, a few months later I wrote 17 More Ways to Run Containers on AWS. And now, since I don't know when to leave well enough alone and stop beating the greasy smear on the sidewalk where the horse used to be, I want to introduce the third article in this series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a week after its leap onto Mac, No Man's Sky is back with another update, this one ushering in a new limited-time expedition focusing on AI corruption and robotic uprisings - and promising hints at future updates and "a deeper story to come".


Expeditions, for those unfamiliar with No Man's Sky's ways, are something like Hello Games' stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges with some nifty rewards.


Its latest expedition, Singularity, which launches today, continues the story started in April's Interceptor update (the one with weird, corrupted worlds and strange Sentinel oddities), asking players to investigate curious robot heads delivering cryptic clues across the galaxy. Its events are said to be part of a longer narrative that'll play out as the year goes on.

The release date for Starbreeze's heist shooter sequel was spotted by Aggiornamenti Lumia, a Twitter account which regularly surfaces listings on the Microsoft Store before they are publicly visible. 


It's interesting timing for a Payday 3 launch date to appear - just a day before Summer Games Fest 2023 kicks off in earnest with an announcement-filled livestream. Other events from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom are also set to follow in the coming days.

This may seem obvious - after all, our own planet is of course a sphere (sorry Flat Earthers) - but when so many games present a flat map, it's easy to misinterpret.


Harrison Pink, senior quest designer on the game, shared this "tiny lore nugget" on Twitter.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Incident Response (IR) allows victim firms to detect, contain, and recover from security incidents. It should also help the wider community avoid similar attacks in the future. In pursuit of these goals, technical practitioners are increasingly influenced by stakeholders like cyber insurers and lawyers. This paper explores these impacts via a multi-stage, mixed methods research design that involved 69 expert interviews, data on commercial relationships, and an online validation workshop. The first stage of our study established 11 stylized facts that describe how cyber insurance sends work to a small numbers of IR firms, drives down the fee paid, and appoints lawyers to direct technical investigators. The second stage showed that lawyers when directing incident response often: introduce legalistic contractual and communication steps that slow-down incident response; advise IR practitioners not to write down remediation steps or to produce formal reports; and restrict access to any documents produced...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Angry Birds: Mystery Island will follow the escapades of three new hatchlings - Mia, Rosie, and Buddy. There is also a new foreign-exchange piglet, and his name is the rather brilliant Hamylton. 


According to a press release, these four "rambunctious tweens" receive an all expenses paid island getaway, but of course things are not going to go to plan. Rather than landing where they intended, they instead get unceremoniously catapulted onto an "uncharted island" (where I assume they will meet Nathan Drake).

Niantic will now return any Remote Raid Pass used on these bosses, and hold an additional "special event" to make up for the error.
Remote Raid Passes were recently nerfed by Niantic to make them less attractive for players to use, with a limit on the number of times they can be used per day and a more expensive price tag. The discovery that Remote Raid Passes were giving lower-than-expected Shiny odds left fans wondering whether this was yet another change by Niantic.

News of EA's plans were first reported by IGN, who claimed the publisher was currently considering shifting The Old Republic's development to Broadsword Online Games, a company run by former BioWare vice president and Mythic Entertainment co-founder Rob Denton, who previously worked on the Star Wars title in its early days.


Broadsword is no stranger to MMOs, of course - its other projects include ongoing work on Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot - and IGN reported EA had already signed a letter of intent with the studio, which would see The Old Republic deal finalised "as soon as this month".

The big news this time around is that the Forgotten Lands' mysterious pumpkin house, which has sat vacant amid gloomy woods since launch, will finally have an occupant as part of what Gameloft is calling Dreamlight Valley's "biggest story update yet".


To the surprise of no-one with at least a passing interest in Disney, its new occupant will be Cinderella's Fairy Godmother - who comes complete with her own set of Friendship Quests - with her arrival seemingly signalling a conclusion for Dreamlight Valley's first major story arc.

Planet Zoo's Arid Animal Pack marks the game's 15th DLC expansion since its launch at the end of 2019, and - as with all Animal Packs - is predominantly focused on expanding the game's wildlife roster, this time with eight new creature additions.


Purchasers get access to the single-humped dromedary camel, the African crested porcupine, the black rhino, the addax (today I learned what an addax is!), the Somali wild ass, the sand cat, the dama gazelle, and the desert horned viper, which appears as an exhibit animal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[343 Industries has shared more on Career Rank, Halo Infinite's previously teased new progression system, ahaed of its Season 4 arrival on 20th June.


Career Rank is described as a "larger progression system" that reflects players' time across the entirety of Halo Infinite's multiplayer modes, and is said to be similar to the progression systems found in Halo: Reach and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.


According to 343, Career Rank is tied to a player's Personal Score, meaning that while all multiplayer matches will help players rank up, better match performance means faster progress through its various tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Onyx.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard seems pretty chuffed with the response to Diablo 4, and is now trumpeting the fact that, not only have players cumulatively already racked up over 10,000 years of play time, Diablo 4 is also the company's "fastest-selling game of all time".


Blizzard is calculating those impressive-sounding play time figures based on the number of in-game hours players have accrued since 1st June, the date when Diablo 4 entered "early access" for those willing to pay extra for the privilege.


The company reckons over 93m hours of Diablo 4 have been played across the first four days, equating to over 10,000 years (actually more like 10,616 hours according to my calculator, but who am I to quibble maths?) - or, as Blizzard puts it, the equivalent of one person "playing 24 hours a day since the beginning of human civilisation".

Word that Epic might be preparing to bring a jungle biome to the latest iteration of Fortnite's map first came via leakers back in April. And a couple of recent official social media asset updates - including some art of a city bordered by vines - lent further credence to those reports.


But now, thanks to a new 8-second teaser shared on the official Fortnite Twitter feed, a jungle biome is a good as confirmed. Peer closely betwixt the lettering and a brisk flyover awaits, skiming over raging waters and lush, mist-shrouded tropical foliage before the camera comes to a halt in view of some squat stone ruins perched atop a cliffside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of rumour and speculation, Apple has unveiled its long-in-the-works augmented reality headset, Vision Pro, which is due to release "early next year" for $3,499 USD.


Vision Pro - which Apple is insisting on referring to as a "spatial computer" - is designed around the idea of staying "present and connected to others", whether at home or at work. Which, in more practical terms, means its entire 3D interface is built around experiencing apps and other media directly within a user's immediate environment, as viewed through its internal display.


Apps can been relocated and resized in the physical space using Apple's new VisionOS 3D interface, which is primarily controlled through a mix of voice commands, eye tracking, and hand tracking - although traditional keyboards and trackpads are compatible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extensive gameplay of Ubisoft's open-world racer The Crew Motorfest has appeared online just a week ahead of its planned appearance at the publisher's Ubisoft Forward showcase.


Ubisoft unveiled The Crew Motorfest for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC back in January with a 49-second trailer featuring a handful of "in-engine" cinematics. It's a live-service game themed around a "one-of-a-kind" motoring festival, promising "tailor-made races, themed events, and other unique challenges", all taking place on the scenic Hawaiian island of O'ahu.


Since that official announcement, Ubisoft has hosted several "insider programme" closed testing sessions for registered players, with the fourth phase currently underway. It's this latest closed test that appears to have generated the spate of new gameplay videos Ubisoft is currently playing copyright-strike whack-a-mole with online.

Well, you don't have to wonder any longer, thanks to a group of modders creating a Resident Evil 0 demake. The game was originally released in 2002 for the GameCube, and looks and plays similar to the HD Resident Evil remaster.

This demake for 0 does the opposite, however, and turns the game into a Resident Evil experience like that of the first three games on PlayStation 1. Footage of the project in action can be seen below, via El Rincon del Lobezno's YouTube channel, who is one of the modders involved in its creation.

Beginning at the end of last week, Square Enix has issued fresh comments on the game each day - thankfully remembering the project still exists, after nearly a year of no news.



The first comment confirmed a release date was being considered, while subsequent comments have noted that the game will have a "multifaceted world with a high degree of freedom" - which some fans are interpreting to mean "open world". Lastly, Square Enix has  clarified that yes, this game will in fact contain a story and characters. Who'd have thought?

However, I - and other fans - think we may have sussed it. Please note, there are some minor Tears of the Kingdom spoilers below.

Phantom Blade Zero was officially announced a couple of weeks ago at Sony's PlayStation Showcase, where it gained attention for its slick wuxia-influenced combat and Souls-esque vibes.

The plot follows Soul, an elite assassin for an organisation known as The Order, as he attempts to track the person who framed him for killing the The Order's patriarch on limited time. S-Game made the comments on what players can expect in its Discord server through a series of developer Q&As.

<blockquote><p>For decades, features have accumulated like cruft in new vehicles: a box here to control the antilock brakes, a module there to run the cruise control radar, and so on. Now engineers and designers are rationalizing the way they go about building new models, taking advantage of much more powerful hardware to consolidate all those discrete functions into a small number of domain controllers.</p>
<p>The behavior of new cars is increasingly defined by software, too. This is merely the progression of a trend that began at the end of the 1970s with the introduction of the first electronic engine control units; today, code controls a car&#8217;s engine and transmission (or its electric motors and battery pack), the steering, brakes, suspension, interior and exterior lighting, and more, depending on how new (and how expensive) it is.

Sony will study "various options" around streaming games, even using its AI agent GT Sophy to enhance cloud gaming, said Yoshida in an interview with the Financial Times.


"I think cloud itself is an amazing business model, but when it comes to games, the technical difficulties are high," said Yoshida. "So there will be challenges to cloud gaming, but we want to take on those challenges."

Ascension was one of the more mysterious projects announced alongside the news that Bloober Team was remaking Silent Hill 2, and there's not been much else said about it since, despite the release date originally pointing to early 2023.

Now, however, we've got an "official trailer" – which is more than we had last time – and confirmation that it's still on track to release at some point later this year.

However, it didn't take long for players to realise that one of the achievements – called "You Can't Be Too Prepared" – was proving difficult to complete, as it requires players to craft every item in the game at least once.

The update comes a decade after the game first debuted back in 2013, and means you no longer bruise your thumb as you spam the run button, tearing through Los Santos.

As spotted by TheGamer, that's not the only quality-of-life improvement making its debut, either. Rather than claim all of your destroyed vehicles from Mors Mutal Insurance individually, you'll now find an option to get it all over with at once. You can also add custom description tags in your garages to "help quickly locate your favourite rides", and believe it or not, snow is also making its long-awaited debut in Creator.

Fans and professional artists were immediately suspicious when the artwork was first revealed, with some providing a breakdown of why the image – reportedly designed by "professional hybrid concept artist" Oskar Manuel – looked as though it had been machine-generated.

CEO Wes Keltner broke the news on Twitter, offering a "friendly reminder" to players that despite their demands, Gun can't add just any character or location from the movie series' considerable back catalogue because it doesn't "have those rights". 

"Friendly reminder. We have the interactive rights to the 1974 film. We can't put characters or locations in from other [Texas Chain Saw] films because we don't have those rights," Keltner explained. "Demanding we add them is not how Hollywood works. Licensing in general is usually a total mess."

Whilst the team confirmed that the DLC plans would "not be moving forward", it did not offer an explanation as to why the content – which started out as a fan-made mod to restore content to the original game – had been scrapped. 

After thanking the KOTOR community for its "immense passion and support for the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series", Aspyr said: "Sadly, today we are announcing that the Restored Content DLC for the Nintendo Switch version of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 – The Sith Lords will not be moving forward for release"."
