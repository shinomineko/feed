We expect the brand new Third Party Security Audit of Kubernetes will be
published later this month (Oct 2022).
In preparation for that, let's look at the state of findings that were made
public as part of the last third party security audit of
2019
that was based on Kubernetes v1.13.4.
Motivation
Craig Ingram has graciously attempted over the years to keep track of the
status of the findings reported in the last audit in this issue:
kubernetes/kubernetes#81146.
This blog post will attempt to dive deeper into this, address any gaps
in tracking and become a point in time summary of the state of the
findings reported from 2019.

Players have reported unexpected server errors and difficulties joining Overwatch 2 games throughout the evening following today's free-to-play launch, with some claiming to be experiencing queues of as many as 40,000 other players.


An earlier tweet by Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra acknowledged today's server woes but gave no indication they might be the result of anything other that launch day teething troubles, only thanking players for their patience and pledging to "get [them] into the fun".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tequila Works, the developer behind the likes of the sublime Rime and intriguing VR murder-mystery The Invisible Hours, has confirmed its formerly Stadia-exclusive action-adventure Gylt will be going multiplatform next year.


Gylt, an enjoyably surreal horror yarn that follows the adventures of a young girl in search of her missing cousin, launched exclusively on Stadia back in 2019. And while Tequila Works did at one point suggest a multiplatform release might eventually be on the cards, it's remained resolutely Stadia-bound in the years since.


However, following last week's announcement that Google will be shutting down Stadia on 18th January next year - a move that prompted questions as to what might happen to the cloud gaming service's handful of remaining exclusives - Tequila Works has confirmed Gylt will finally be getting a multiplatform release some time in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt co-founder Marcin Iwiński has announced he'll be stepping down from his joint-CEO role - a position he's held at the company for nearly 30 years - before the end of 2022.


"I am beginning a brand-new personal chapter at CD Projekt," Iwiński wrote in a statement shared following the company's latest investor meeting, "as I will submit my candidacy for the role of Chairman of the Supervisory Board, leaving behind my joint-CEO role. By the end of 2022, I'll hand over my duties to my colleagues from the board."


"For me this is a huge moment," Iwiński continued. "I've been at CD Projekt for almost 30 years and I have seen it go from a handful of passion-driven rebels to an internationally recognised developer of story-driven role-playing games loved by millions globally. Back when Michał Kiciński and I founded the company, I don't think either of us would have been able to imagine this incredible journey, not even in our wildest dreams."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst has revealed Sony's first-party PlayStation releases will likely take "at least a year" to launch on PC, although live-service games might come sooner.


Sony initially confirmed it was exploring bringing its first-party PlayStation exclusives to PC in March 2020, announcing that Horizon Zero Dawn would lead the charge - although it said "releasing one first-party AAA title to PC doesn't necessarily mean that every game now will come to PC" and that it didn't have plans to follow Xbox's lead with day-and-date PC releases.


Since then, following the successful launch of Horizon Zero Dawn on PC, the number of titles joining the platform has continued to grow. Days Gone, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered have already made the jump, with Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Uncharted: The Legacy Collection, and Sackboy: A Big Adventure confirmed to be on the way.

Announcing the hold-up this afternoon, Sega said Relic Entertainment's real-time strategy threequel was currently "not quite up to our players' or our own high standards", with "bugs to squash, pixels to polish, gameplay to adjust and feedback to address". 


On that last point, Sega says developer Relic is continuing to react to community feedback on improvements to the game's dynamic campaign map, a stronger visual focus on "grit and details" during battles, an overhauled light system, plus tweaks to the HUD and UI.

Per The Washington Post, Activision Blizzard and the QA testers from Raven Software will now continue on with their negotiations to agree a collective bargaining agreement.
However, if the two parties can not settle upon an agreement, the NLRB can issue a complaint against Activision Blizzard. Another option would be for the NLRB to prosecute the case before a federal judge should the company refuse to settle, although this is deemed unlikely.

A jury has decided the companies must pay $3750 to Catherine Alexander, who designed tattoos for pro wrestler Randy Orton, after their likenesses appeared on Orton's character in WWE 2K16, 17 and 18.


Alexander had pushed for a higher amount, including a share of profits from the games, Reuters reported. Still, the decision appears to mark a landmark judgement that may affect future usage rights in other games in future.

In this article, we introduce Kueue,

Kueue leaves pod-level orchestration to existing stable components of Kubernetes.
Kueue natively supports the Kubernetes Job

Fans gathered earlier today to witness the final moments of Overwatch, recording the momentous occasion for posterity. Despite its place in the gaming pantheon, though, it met an unceremonious end, blinking out of existing with a simple "disconnected" message.


A few official lobby chat server messages did at least attempt to imbue the occasion with some import, telling players, "Even the best journeys end, but a new one is right around the corner. Thank you, heroes! See you October 4th!". A final message ahead of Overwatch 1's oblivion simply read, "See you on the other side".

This time, though, EA Motive is attempting to bolster the fear factor on modern systems with enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks including improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Since confirming a Dead Space remake was in the works last year, EA Motive has been unusually open about its development process, detailing the project's progress in a series of livestreams focusing on gameplay changes, audio, and art.

This project was dubbed Heroes of Hyrule, and would not have had Link as the main character. Rather, the Hylian hero would have turned up as an NPC. 


Per YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming, which got its hands on Retro Studios' original pitch, Heroes of Hyrule would have told the story of a magical book.

When Black launched in 2006 for PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, it promised to be Criterion's revolutionary take on the FPS genre - just as Burnout had won legions of fans for the studio's version of racing. 


The game recieved largely positive reviews, though early plans for a sequel never materialised. Some who worked on the game, including its namesake Stuart Black, later left to make Bodycount - a spiritual successor developed by Codemasters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-profile mod maker Lance McDonald has released footage of what looks to be a working PlayStation 5 exploit that leaves the console "jailbroken". 


McDonald's video appears to show custom code being read by a PS5 through an exploit in its online User Guide. Once run, the console is able to access debug settings and then install the infamous PT demo - which is, of course, no longer available under normal circumstances.


So, how bad is this for Sony? Well, for now, the use of this exploit is limited. Reportedly this method is still "fairly unstable" and offers "read/write access, but no execute" - so you could download the PT demo, for example, but not yet play it.

Kubernetes v1.25 introduces the support for user namespaces.
This is a major improvement for running secure workloads in
Kubernetes. Each pod will have access only to a limited subset of the
available UIDs and GIDs on the system, thus adding a new security
layer to protect from other pods running on the same system.
How does it work?
A process running on Linux can use up to 4294967296 different UIDs and
GIDs.
User namespaces is a Linux feature that allows mapping a set of users
in the container to different users in the host, thus restricting what
IDs a process can effectively use.
Furthermore, the capabilities granted in a new user namespace do not
apply in the host initial namespaces.
Why is it important?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A GTA 5 player who failed their in-game driving test is only using public transport to get around Los Santos. 

After failing their San Andreas driving test, redditor MotorDesigner reached out to the GTA subreddit for advice on the best way to get around the city without a car - legally, in other words, even though the concept is comically novel in any GTA game, of course.

Admittedly, the in-game driving test doesn't look too troublesome - questions include when it's permissible to run a red light, what the correct driving position is, and how best to drive when "getting serviced orally by a girl while driving" - MotorDesigner failed to meet the San Andreas Department of Motor Vehicles' low, low standards, and therefore cannot drive legally in the city.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard's chief compliance officer, Frances Townsend, is stepping down.

Bloomberg reports that Townsend - who also serves as executive vice president of corporate affairs - will step down ahead of Microsoft's billion pound deal to acquire Activision (if it goes through, of course).

Townsend will, however, remain with the company as an advisor to the board and CEO Bobby Kotick, although his future at the company is also in doubt if and when the acquisition goes through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese megacorp Tencent is reportedly "resetting its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategy" by focussing on "buying majority stakes mainly in overseas gaming companies".

According to Reuters, Tencent traditionally acquired minority stakes and was content with being a "passive financial investor", but it is now "aggressively seeking to own majority or even controlling stakes in overseas targets", chiefly in the "core gaming sector". Metaverse assets are also reportedly of interest to Tencent. 

Citing "four people with direct knowledge of the matter", Reuters adds that the shift in Tencent's M&A strategy "comes as the world's number one gaming firm by revenue is counting on global markets for its future growth, which requires a strong portfolio of chart-topping games" and follows regulatory issues in its home country.

In a series of messages shared on Twitter, Dandy @ 6.2 –  who clarifies that they are "not a victim in this" but is "speaking out for a friend who IS a victim who otherwise felt like she had no voice" – posts a number of incriminating messages that intimate that despite reporting him, the alleged "sex pest" known as Charcoal Salamander had yet to be stripped of his "admin" role on the server. 

"So who else knew that the Phasmophobia devs are housing a sex pest in their official discord by keeping him admin and refusing to take any claims against him seriously because I sure do now," tweeted Dandy @ 6.2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little over six months after its big reveal, World of Warcraft's Dragonflight expansion has been given a release date, with its launch now officially scheduled for 28th November this year.


As detailed back in April, Dragonflight's first major addition is a new location known as the Dragon Isles, the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind. This, in turn, brings four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, the expansive Ohn'ahran Plains, the frozen Azure Span, and the majestic Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also introduces a new playable race-class hybrid (a first for WoW) known as the Dracthyr Evokers, which can switch between human and draconic forms. Depending on a player's chosen class specialisations, its focus is either damage dealing or healing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google is shutting down Stadia, with the beleaguered cloud gaming service set to remain live for players until 18th January 2023.


Stadia's misfortunes are, of course, well-documented; despite initial praise for the service's streaming capabilities at launch in 2019, a slow, problematic roll-out meant Google failed to capitalise on initial consumer interest. The extent of Stadia's failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.

Immutable fields can be found in a few places in the built-in Kubernetes types.
For example, you can't change the .metadata.name of an object. Specific objects

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret we're big fans of PowerWash Simulator here at Eurogamer which, for me, makes this hour-long development deep dive video something of a must-watch. 


I've often wondered while playing whether certain objects auto-complete faster than others. If you're yet to try PowerWash yourself, it's worth knowing the game will, after you clean a certain amount of surface area, auto-complete the rest of the object in question. (This also provides a nice 'ding' sound.)


This subject is one of many covered in the developer video, which is ostensibly about how levels in the game are created but also delves into thoughts on dirt design, parkour, and the game's lack of fall damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yves Guillemot, boss and co-founder of Ubisoft, has raised eyebrows for his comments on the need for "a little friction" in game development. 


Discussing his company's troubles with harassment and workplace toxicity, as highlighted by a number of employees since the summer of 2020, Guillemot told La Presse that Ubisoft had been "progressing at a good pace" in dealing with its issues - but that "creating a video game is not easy" and sometimes created "a lot of tension". 


"Techniques must be put in place to ensure that everyone succeeds in finding their place," Guillemot continued, now discussing the games industry in general. "To create, you need a little friction, because everyone has to succeed in getting their idea across. It's a job that brings a lot of rewards when you succeed, but it's difficult."

This trailer didn't have any real dialogue between the characters (there were plenty of tense looks and some furtive Shh-ing), but it still offered an evocative picture of the world that HBO has created for its TV audience. You can see this trailer for yourself below. 


Right off the bat, it is clear HBO has taken this adaptation seriously, with several scenes looking like they have been pulled straight from Naughty Dog's video game series. There is a lot to unpack in the minute and half or so of footage, so let's dive on in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early access roguelike Darkest Dungeon 2 is getting a major update which reworks the game's progression system - and also resets some player stats, developer Red Hook Games has warned.


The Altar of Hope update adds a new type of reward - Candles of Hope - which you can earn and then spend on various attributes which should make future missions safer for your party.


As you'd expect, the bigger the danger, the bigger reward in terms of Candles bagged at the end. Missions will offer more Candles the further you manage to progress, but suffer a wipe and you'll see your Candle hoard penalised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactics Ogre Reborn producer Hiroaki Kato didn't consider the HD-2D style for the remake, despite its use in this year's Triangle Strategy and Live A Live.


Speaking to IGN, Kato admitted he likes the style but the 2D pixel art of the original has been retained instead.


"No, we didn't think about making it HD-2D," he said. "We kind of played with the idea of making it 3D, but what we were really thinking about was, 'What are the major parts about this game that are really appealing to everybody?' And in the 2D original, it was really well done pixel art, so we realised that we couldn't have a Tactics Ogre game without this really high-quality, awesome looking 2D pixel art. So to bring that sort of resolution and that sort of fidelity to new hardware and new technology was a lot of effort. But yeah, I think we did it."

This will include fart bombs (of course) and a move called "Meeseeks and Destroys" which summons a meeseek that will then attack by running forward and deploying an uppercut or by wielding a golfclub. Lastly, Rick will be able to aim and place two portals thanks to his "Basrick Portal Theory" move.

DICE has taken the decision "to competely remove certain sections of the map" which it has decided broke the game's "flow" or were simply "too far away".

Their latest mod is Trombone Champ, the surprise Steam hit of last week.

Raicuparta shared a video of himself attempting Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in VR. The display inside the headset shows a first-person view of the titular Trombone Champ and the gameplay screen is projected in front of you. The game is played with motion controls, meaning you have to extend and retract your arm instead of moving a mouse back and forth for the correct notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ever-expanding world of Assassin's Creed Valhalla will receive one of its final major updates tomorrow, as it adds a final set of puzzle tombs via patch 1.6.1. 


This activity was originally added to the game earlier this year, and adds a new storyline expanding upon the series' mysterious precursor Isu race, doled out by exploring a string of fun puzzle dungeons. 


It also allows for Eivor to come face-to-face with a series of British figures from history before her time - such as the ancient queen of the Iceni, Boudicca. Fans have some interesting theories on who may pop up in this concluding set of dungeons (including someone perhaps more from Assassin's Creed lore than actual history itself).

These latter charges likely refer to the teen's previous run-in with police over hacking charges - when they were suspected of breaching both Microsoft and Samsung earlier in the year.

But what if you were to throw a load of zombie-like monsters into this experience, and then proceed to turn out the lights, leaving the exit near impossible to find? Well, one developer has decided to answer that question in its upcoming game: The Store is closed.


The Store is Closed is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games' The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy (thanks, PCGamesN).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new PC mod is replacing the face and voice of a Judgment character whose original likeness was unceremoniously pulled several years ago following a drugs arrest.

Originally, the character model and voice for Judgement character Kyohei Hamura was based upon Japanese musician and actor Pierre Taki. Shortly after his drugs arrest, however, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios scrambled to replace him with the voice and likeness of Japanese actor Miou Tanaka instead.

Modder Timo 654, however, has brought Taki back to life - so to speak - by meticulously restoring the original voice lines and likeness.

Whilst we've yet to hear of a definitive date, creator Yoko Taro was at least able to confirm the release window during Aniplex Online Fest, which took place over the weekend.

Interestingly, Taro also revealed that due to the differences between storytelling via games and traditional mediums - and despite Aniplex's hopes of a faithful retelling of the game - the anime's story will differ.

According to SteamDB, the beta is currently sporting more concurrent players than Team Fortress 2, Destiny 2, GTA 5, and even Cyberpunk 2077, which has seen a boost in its own player numbers recently, too. 

With an all-time concurrent peak of 168,330 players (at the time of writing, anyway; it's been increasing steadily all weekend), that means it's already beaten the concurrent records for games like Left 4 Dead 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, The Division, FIFA 22, and Borderlands 2.

Bandai Namco was originally forced to shutter the PC PvP servers for all Dark Souls games back in January following "reports of an issue with online servers". Although the publisher described the situation as "temporary", it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3's servers finally coming back online at the end of August… and going down again earlier this week.

On 21st September, Bandai Namco said "there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls 3 online play via the Steam platform" and revealed that it was "investigating the source of the problem", but the servers remained offline for several days.

This range consists of a Sly plushy (seen in the header image), a print of some anniversary artwork by the original Sly Cooper's art director Dev Madan and an anniversary T-shirt.


The artwork is certainly an impressive collection of nostalgia for Sly Cooper fans. Madan has rammed it full of references and Easter eggs from the last 20 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh batch of freebies has arrived on the Epic Games Store, with this week's offerings coming in the form of dinosaur survival adventure Ark: Survival Evolved and the video game adaptation of acclaimed board game Gloomhaven.


This isn't Ark: Survival Evolved's first outing as an Epic freebie - it was given away in June 2020 - but if you're a survival fan who hasn't yet given it a look, it's still probably worth checking out.


Released back in August 2017 after several years in early access, Ark's base game offers a broadly compelling (if rather rickety) blend of dinosaur taming and breeding, base building, and survival meter management, all in service of massive-scale tribal warfare - unless you opt to join a PvE server, in which case your most terrifying foe is usually a pillar. Subsequent expansions, not included with Epic's freebie, have upped the sci-fi and fantasy factor, which, if you enjoy the base game's rhythms, you might find more to your taste.

Creative director Davide Soliani was initially told Rabbids were not to speak by Ubisoft. However, thanks to some creative manipulation of the rules and a successful bid by Soliani to "gain trust" from Ubisoft, Mario and his Rabbid companions will now talk during their upcoming escapades (thanks, IGN).


Let's rewind back to the start to understand how this all came about.

Last night, I finished Return to Monkey Island. It was an amazing moment for me, and as I sat watching the credits roll with my heart feeling pleasantly full I saw a name make its way up the screen that I did not expect to see there - Neil Druckmann.


"Neil Druckmann?" my mind tried to compute, as my lips verbalised my amazement. Surely not the Neil Druckmann whose Ellie and Joel can be heard cussing left, right and centre in a game that is definitely not for children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seven new patent filings from Destiny developer Bungie have been unearthed, predominantly all linked to virtual controls on touch-enabled devices, lending further credence to reports earlier this year that it had a Destiny mobile game in the works.


Those reports first surfaced back in July, when The Game Post, citing a source with knowledge of Chinese mobile developer NetEase's plans, claimed the company was collaborating with Bungie to bring a completely new instalment in the Destiny series to mobile - a project said to have already been in development for several years.


It's in this context that the seven newly unearthed Bungie patents (as spotted by The Game Post) prove particularly interesting. Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an 'isometric/top-down' perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google's Arts and Culture team has created a cute Zelda-like adventure for those looking to further their education on ancient Mesoamerica.


Known as The Descent on the Serpent, this game was made in collaboration with Mexico's National Museum of Anthropology (thanks, The Verge). It starts off with the player visiting a museum. However, out of nowhere, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, Tezcatlipoca, rushes in and steals an artefact on display. 


This clearly can't be good news, and soon a talking statue, which is also on display at the museum, asks for your help returning the artefact  before the equinox happens. Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do "love exploring". The talking statue then swiftly transports you back in time to ancient Mesoamerica where you need to find 20 icons to return to the city of Chichen Itza.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GTA Forum, where this week's Grand Theft Auto leaks occurred, has suggested the leak may have been the work of more than one person.


The initial leaker is known as Teapot and used the account @teapotuberhacker, but the forum believes another user, with the moniker Lily, also had access to this account.


It’s unclear whether this second user has access to any hacked material, though the forum believes this is not the case.

In Kubernetes 1.25, Validation rules for CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) have graduated to Beta!
Validation rules make it possible to declare how custom resources are validated using the Common Expression Language (CEL). For example:
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
 ...
 openAPIV3Schema:
 type: object
 properties:
 spec:
 type: object
 x-kubernetes-validations:
 - rule: "self.minReplicas <= self.replicas && self.replicas <= self.maxReplicas"
 message: "replicas should be in the range minReplicas..maxReplicas."
 properties:
 replicas:
 type: integer
 ...


Validation rules support a wide range of use cases. To get a sense of some of the capabilities, let's look at a few examples:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we're discussing video game leaks, following last weekend's devastating hack of Rockstar Games which saw almost an hour of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage spilled onto the internet and promptly dissected by the masses.


The sheer fact Rockstar had been hacked in this manner was itself shocking - but the damage felt worse due to the negative comments this work-in-progress content then received. The hack has robbed Rockstar of its oppurtunity to show the game on its own terms - and for what benefit? We discuss.

After that, we turn our attention to the YouTuber who accidentally outed themselves as being behind an "insider" Twitter account after posting under-wraps information they had been given by Ubisoft. Join Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan for their thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Microsoft starts to feel more heat from regulatory bodies over its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, CEO Satya Nadella has said he's "very confident” the deal will go through.


Governmental scrutiny of Microsoft's acquisition has grown in recent weeks, with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority announcing it was moving to a more in-depth "phase 2" of its investigation, having determined the acquisition would give rise to the "realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services."


Sony, too, has grown increasingly vocal over the proposed deal, particularly as it pertains to potential console exclusivity around the likes of Call of Duty. Early this month, for instance, PlayStation head Jim Ryan called Microsoft's reassurances that the hugely popular shooter would remain on PS5 post-acquisition "inadequate".

Bloody Ties - the first of two bits of story DLC currently confirmed as part of Dying Light 2's five year journey of post-launch support - takes players to The Carnage Hall, an old opera house said to be the "epicentre of death, wealth and absolute splendour". Here, they'll find "challenges and quests, surprising new weapon types, character interactions, and discoveries to uncover."


This initial bit of story DLC was originally expected to launch in June but was delayed to September for additional development. That date then slipped again, with Techland announcing a 13th October release date as August came to an end.

Grand Theft Auto IV - Definitive Edition is a project which complied a number of mods which aimed to enhance and update the game to run on modern PCs (thanks, PC Gamer). 


The game was last updated by Rockstar in 2020, when the developer removed the archaic Games for Windows Live DRM after it was shut down by Microsoft. However, this also had the unfortunate effect of disabling access to online multiplayer and leaderboards, which were run through the GFWL backend.

If you're yet to try it, Spiritfarer is a memorable and moving adventure game where you shepard a crew of lost souls into the after life, while slowly upgrading your boat.


In a nutshell, it's a "cosy management game about dying", and one of my favourite games from 2020. If this news means more people get to play it - all the better!

The report, which has been carefully scanned and uploaded here, includes the standard yearly company round-up, plus some accompanying images of Nintendo's star roster and various consoles including the Nintendo 64 and the destined for failure Virtual Boy.

Ahead of these releases, its developer has shared some behind the scenes titbits about the game's manual, including how a real one was made to ensure authenticity within the game


Sharing on the PlayStation Blog, Tunic's lead developer Andrew Shouldice expressed his love for old-school game's manuals. "The more I thought about it though, the more I realised that my love for this kind of mystery came not just from the games, but from the manuals they were packaged with," Shouldice wrote, stating he would "pore over these documents endlessly".


Such was Shouldice's love for these manuals, he decided to incorporate one into Tunic's gameplay. In this case, the player picks up pages for the manual as they make their way through the game's mysterious word. These are then pieced together, allowing the player to uncover more of Tunic's many (many) secrets.

At the top end, the RTX 4090 will cost an eye-watering $1599. The RTX 4080 16GB will cost $1199, while the RTX 4080 12GB will cost $899.


Many had hoped for lower prices - but, according to Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, these costs reflect a world where Moore's law - where performance is doubled for half the price every two years - is now "dead".

What we're getting is a DLC package known as the Winters Expansion, which will include a third-person mode for the base game, a rework of the Mercenaries Mode which will introduce new playable characters such as Lady Dimitrescu, and the new story-based chapter known as Shadows of Rose.


Shadows of Rose will put Ethan Winters' daughter into the spotlight as she makes her way through the  consciousness of the Megamycete. This, Capcom has said, will conclude the Winters family story. However, Rose was not always going to be the focus of this story DLC. Instead, Capcom also had ideas for a Chris Redfield focused expansion.

Furthermore, multiplayer and touchscreen support are reportedly being added to all previous Switch instalments at the same time.


Picross S8, as this newest entry is known, follows the same familiar formula as its predecessors - each stage requiring players to complete a picture on a grid by solving numerical clues indicating which squares must be filled in - but adds a bit of spice to proceedings by letting four players put their heads together to tackle each challenge.


According to the official Picross website, it's local multiplayer only (the trailer suggests there's a score-based component despite everyone working co-operatively to complete the same puzzle), and each player will need their own controller to participate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearbox has called the release of Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands a "great victory" for the studio, saying its success means it "now clearly [has] a new franchise on its hands", with more "experiences" already in development.


Tiny Tina's Wonderlands released back in March, taking the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2's much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep and building it out into a full-length game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


It was generally well-received by critics on release - Eurogamer called it "endearing" despite its "hodgepodge design" - and it's apparently been enough of a commercial success that Gearbox is now eager to do more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A month after Dark Souls 3's Steam servers were finally bought online following more than seven months of downtime, they're offline again, with publisher Bandai Namco confirming it's currently "investigating" the issue.


The Dark Souls server woes began in January, when Bandai Namco was forced to disable servers for all Dark Souls games following reports of serious security concerns. Although the publisher described the situation as 'temporary' at the time, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3's servers finally coming back online at the end of August.


Unfortunately, the celebrations have been short-lived, and the game's PvP servers are, as of yesterday, once again unavailable, preventing players from accessing any of its online features.

Customisation options for the Elite Wireless Controller Series 2's Xbox button can be found in the latest version of the Xbox Accessories app on console and PC while a controller is connected. Here, users can visit the Colour tab to tinker with the Xbox button's brightness, or use the menu sliders to pick one out of a possible 16 million hues.


In addition to button customisation, September's Xbox update brings a revamp to the 'My games and apps' Full library view on consoles, streamlining access to all games available to install and play. Furthermore, 'All games' now displays every title a user has access to, including those on Game Pass, EA Access, and those claimed via Games with Gold.

The claim follows months of legal back and forth between cheat seller AimJunkies and Destiny developer Bungie, which has seen the former accused of both trademark and copyright infringement. 


AimJunkies has previously attempted to shrug off these claims, but has now gone one further. As reported by Torrentfreak, the cheat seller has now launched a countersuit which alleges Bungie accessed its computers for anti-cheat purposes via "clandestine surveillance" - effectively, that Bungie hacked it.

Call of the Sea - which initially launched for PC and consoles at the tail-end of 2020 - tells the story of Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One's Cissy Jones), as she investigates a beautiful South Pacific island, circa 1934, in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a captivating, often ingenious blend of story, exploration, and puzzling that successfully hits some powerful emotional beats even as it tips gently into cosmic weirdness.

Wingefors, whose company owns Saints Row developer Volition, acknowledged that views on the series' reboot had been "polarised" following its bug-laced release - in Eurogamer's Saints Row review, Vikki Blake noted that its 'Unto the Breach' mission was unplayable for her.


"There are a lot of things that could be said and details around it. I'm happy to see a lot of gamers and fans happy. At the same time I'm a bit sad to see fans also not happy," Lars told investors (via Axios' Stephen Totilo).

In a detailed blog post, Nvidia stated that "full ray tracing" will mean every level will be transformed. Light will now bounce around the settings, and "be affected by the scene's geometry and materials". Meanwhile, where shadows are being cast, these will be "pixel perfect".


"Portal's unique selling point is the ability to take anything through a portal, and see through them, something that hadn't been done before its release," Nvidia elaborated. "With ray tracing, light can pass through portals, too. Even the light from the moving High Energy Pellets will cast through portals, causing shadows to shift in step." You can see a little preview of Portal with RTX below.

"Investigations found there was no evidence substantiating the allegations of this former employee who resigned in 2019. We stand against all forms of harassment and take any allegation extremely seriously. We support those who have concerns they wish to raise. We therefore took the necessary time to thoroughly investigate allegations at Rocksteady Studios with the utmost integrity. 
"An external, independent law firm conducted a full and thorough investigation, including interviewing current and former employees, not only researching past allegations, but also examining the current culture of the studio. Furthermore, a Warner Bros. Discovery (then Warner Media) People Relations team, independent of the games division, diligently researched and investigated any allegations raised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New footage filmed on the show floor of E3 1999 has been posted on YouTube, and gives us one of the closest looks yet at the cut "Perfect Head" feature from N64 gem Perfect Dark.

Perfect Head would have allowed players to scan a face into the game using the camera on a Game Boy, which could then be mapped onto a multiplayer character's head. The feature was complete and functional, but was removed from the game for its release. 

In an 2020 interview conducted by our own Wesley Yin-Poole, several of the developers revealed it had been removed at Nintendo's request due to the recent Columbine High School massacre and concerns over the feature's potential uses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new and detailed report by Bloomberg has highlighted the numbers of children who stream on Twitch, and the number of accounts linked to adult predators who follow and interact with them.


Research includes various examples of children being asked by adult users to engage in explicit or inappropriate activities and perform dances or "dares" while live-streaming. After said streams have ended, the recordings are often viewed by hundreds of other accounts - far more than expected for small channels their size.


The report suggests this is due to "hundreds" of accounts believed to be used by predators, which have collated follower lists each with "more than 1000 kids on their following lists".

The highlight here is Infinity Ward's explanation for Modern Warfare 2's divisive mini-map, which has come under fire from some players for failing to provide enough information on enemy players.


Unlike some previous Call of Duty games, Modern Warfare 2's mini-map only shows enemy player dots when a UAV is active. This means it does not display red dots when enemy players sprint or fire their weapons.

<blockquote><p>Maybe you heard about the truly insane false-start controversy in track and field? Devon Allen&#8212;a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles&#8212;was disqualified from the 110-meter hurdles at the World Athletics Championships a few weeks ago for a false start.</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: World Athletics has determined that it is not possible for someone to push off the block within a tenth of a second of the gun without false starting. They have science that shows it is beyond human capabilities to react that fast. Of course there are those (I&#8217;m among them) who would tell you that&#8217;s nonsense, that&#8217;s pseudoscience, there&#8217;s no way that they can limit human capabilities like that.

Developer Rusty Lake has released 14 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner to date - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - each delivering a deliciously surreal, narratively interconnected slice of casual point-and-click puzzling with a room escape slant.


The Past Within is Rusty Lake's first attempt at a co-operative adventure, expanding the series' familiar formula, both spacially and temporally, as two players work together across different timelines - one located in the past, the other in the future - to solve the mysteries surrounding recurring series character Albert Vanderboom.

On seeing this leaked footage, some corners of the internet decided to use it as ammunition to criticise Rockstar's unfinished work.


"If you knew how game development goes, you'd know that visuals are one of the first things done. This game is four years into planning and development. What you see is almost exactly what you will get. The next year is mission coding and debugging. All backend stuff. It does look ass," claimed one Twitter user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch has updated its regulations on gambling on the streaming platform, following an outcry from streamers.


The new policy prohibits streaming of gambling sites that include slots, roulette, or dice games that aren't licensed in the US or "other jurisdictions that provide sufficient consumer protection" from 18th October.


This follows strike threats from some of the biggest Twitch streamers after former Team Liquid member ItsSliker admitted to have scammed viewers and fellow streamers out of $200k to fund his gambling addiction.

Allen gained brief internet fame by leaking details of Ubisoft's various Assassin's Creed announcements - details which he had been given by Ubisoft itself to prepare content while under embargo.


But his identity as "TheRealInsider" was exposed over the weekend, when Allen replied to a tweet from a fan from his main account instead. Allen then swiftly deleted the tweet, the insider account, and subsequently issued a brief Twitter statement saying sorry.

Kubernetes v1.25, released earlier this month, introduced a new feature
that lets your cluster expand storage volumes, even when access to those
volumes requires a secret (for example: a credential for accessing a SAN fabric)
to perform node expand operation. This new behavior is in alpha and you
must enable a feature gate (CSINodeExpandSecret) to make use of it.
You must also be using CSI
storage; this change isn't relevant to storage drivers that are built in to Kubernetes.
To turn on this new, alpha feature, you enable the CSINodeExpandSecret feature
gate for the kube-apiserver and kubelet, which turns on a mechanism to send secretRef

the same to perfor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Citizen, the controversial space sim from developer Cloud Imperium Games, has now raised more than half a billion dollars in funding from backers.


Star Citizen's exceedingly lengthy development is well-documented, with the game still in alpha over a decade after production began. And while it's attracted some private funding in that time, the overwhelming bulk has come via crowdfunding, beginning with a successful $2m USD Kickstarter in 2012 and ballooning from there.


As of today, Star Citizen has amassed $500,075,150 USD in crowdfunding from a total of 4,096,384 backers, according to the official Roberts Space Industries website. Its previous major milestone of $400m USD raised was reached last November, meaning it's taken a further ten months to accrue an additional $100m.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has announced it will be raising its App Store prices in multiple territories - including every country that uses the euro, but excluding the UK at present - starting on 5th October.


As per an update shared with developers, which did not provide an explanation for the impending price hike, Apple said the move will impact all tiers of its App Store pricing chart in the following areas: Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, Vietnam, and all territories that use the euro currency. 


When the pricing changes come into effect on 5th October, App Store items previously priced at €0.99 will, for instance, increase to €1.19, while apps formerly costing €9.99 will rise to €11.99. App Store developers who offer subscriptions will, however, have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.

Hints of an impending crossover with the award-winning Apple TV+ comedy series first emerged last week, when a listing for AFC Richmond - the fictional London team managed by Ted Lasso in the show - briefly appeared on EA's FIFA ratings database  before being removed.


That might have been the end of it, but now the official Ted Lasso Twitter account has shared an image showing what appears to be Ted Lasso actor Jason Sudeikis, albeit from behind, ensconced in the FIFA team's facial capture rig - used to digitise the real-world likeness of players (and, for the first time this year, managers) for use in-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, Nvidia finally revealed the new RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 video cards, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. We've been hands-on with the RTX 4090 for the last few days and we're hard at work on content focusing on the firm's latest AI-based frame generation technology - DLSS 3.
First impressions on the RTX 4090 itself though? It's easily one of the biggest gen-on-gen increases in performance we've seen, even based on limited testing. 4K gaming for higher refresh rate monitors and TVs is not a problem on most modern titles - and by extension, 8K at 60fps is now viable if you're one of the crazy few (like me) that actually has an 8K TV. Combine that increase in performance with the new DLSS 3 - with its AI-based frame generation - and suddenly the most intense workloads in PC gaming play out with unerring fluidity.
We were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already sunk a full weekend into it, we're not done yet and need some extra time - so with that being the case, we've put together a teaser video showing some of the work we've already done.

For several months now, Larson has been voicing the role of Paradigm, one of the game's heroic Seven. The Captain Marvel actress debuted as Paradigm in Fortnite's Chapter 3 Season 2 live event, where she commanded players as they took control of the game's infamous bear mech. 


Larson has regularly popped up since, voicing audio logs and mission chatter for Fortnite's weekly tasks through the recently-concluded Chapter 3 Season 3. Now, with the launch of Season 4, we've seen her with her helmet off for the first time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new teaser for Netflix's Sonic Prime show has been unveiled by Sega. 


This trailer sees everyone's favourite blue blur being incredibly blue and blurry as he makes his way through the world. Oh, and Shadow and Doctor Eggman are also hot on his heels. 


Along with this teaser, which you can see below, Sega has assured us that Sonic will "shatter" our worlds when Sonic Prime airs this winter on Netflix. And yes, I feel quite agitated writing about a Netflix show with the word 'Prime' in its title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia has announced its latest generation of GeForce RTX graphics cards at its GTC AI conference. The Nvidia RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 are the first GPUs from the 'Ada Lovelace' series, and they should be up to twice as fast as their last-gen counterparts in rasterised games - and up to four times as fast in ray-traced games.  
The RTX 4090 24GB will be available on October 12th and costs $1599/£1679, while the RTX 4080 16GB arrives in November and costs $1199/£1269. There's also an RTX 4080 12GB model that costs $899/£949. The 4090 and 4080 are reportedly two to four times faster than their Ampere equivalents, which are the 3090 Ti and the 3080 Ti, respectively. 
Note that Nvidia RTX 30-series cards will remain on sale for the moment, filling in the bottom part of the market until lower-tier RTX 40-series GPUs arrive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has confirmed it is developing a single-player third-person action adventure Iron Man game as part of a new collaboration between it and Marvel for "several" new projects.


The game - which is yet to be titled - is in the works at Star Wars Squadrons studio Motive, which is also developing the upcoming Dead Space remake.


The project still seems some way off, and EA lists it as in pre-production. As with other recent early announcements, the confirmation appears to have been made to spur recuitment on the game (and also follows earlier whispers of its existence).

Now, one such mod has given the game a literal face lift, by replacing the new model of Peter Parker with that of the game's original PlayStation 4 one. 


This mod was uploaded to Nexus mods by DaigronCDM. Known as the 'John Bubniak - PS4 face restoration mod', it does exactly as you'd expect. It makes Peter Parker look more like John Bubniak, Spidey's original face model before the character was redesigned to look more like actor Yuri Lowenthal.

The online requirements for Xbox games have previously come under fire for being unclear and rendering downloaded and offline games unplayable during service outages. 

Microsoft has recently made a quiet change to the checks made when launching games on Xbox Series X. For anyone making good use of the Series X's backwards compatibility, there are now no online DRM checks for Xbox One discs. (Of course, this was not an issue on the disc-less Series S.)

In a statement published this afternoon on Twitter, as the company returned to work, Rockstar admitted it had suffered a "network intrusion" - a hack - from which the early development footage of GTA 6 had been taken.
Rockstar said it hoped the hack would have no impact on its live services - such as GTA Online - and insisted the leak would not impact the development of the game long-term. Still, Rockstar acknowleged it was "extremely disappointed" at what had happened.

Local ephemeral storage capacity isolation was introduced as a alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.7 and it went beta in 1.9. With Kubernetes 1.25 we are excited to announce general availability(GA) of this feature.
Pods use ephemeral local storage for scratch space, caching, and logs. The lifetime of local ephemeral storage does not extend beyond the life of the individual pod. It is exposed to pods using the container’s writable layer, logs directory, and EmptyDir volumes. Before this feature was introduced, there were issues related to the lack of local storage accounting and isolation, such as Pods not knowing how much local storage is available and being unable to request guaranteed local storage.

"While we know many players have enjoyed this new mode introduced in Season 2, at this stage it’s been steadily declining and starting to fall short of the quality bar for a positive player experience.

Whilst there's no way of authenticating them, the initially hostile response on the GTA Forums eventually softened as posters began to believe that the leaked assets were genuine.

It's been three years since Spencer first mentioned plans to bring Square Enix's fan-favourite MMO to Xbox and while there's been no movement, Spencer gave "a commitment" that the company was still trying to make it happen.

"Hahaha, I did say that," he laughed when asked by Game Watch if he remembered talking about it way back in 2019.

Though the Steam Deck Steam page mentions the dock and still invites interested players to wishlist the item, we've not seen nor heard much about it since Valve began shipping its sought-after handheld system.

As spotted by NME, Valve has the dock on display at Tokyo Game Show, giving fans a chance to check out the new kit and count - and argue about - those all-important ports on the back, which crucially  seem to show just one USB-C port, which is for the power cable.

In an update posted to the game's official website (via Reddit), Respawn responded to players' reports that some of the battle royale's weapon skins offered an unfair competitive advantage when aiming down sights.

"Competitive integrity is and will always be a core pillar for Apex Legends," Respawn said. "As part of that, our default iron sights are designed to push players to loot for better optics. We also believe that skins shouldn't be a factor in the sights functionality as well.

In an interview with Yakuza fan site Tojo Dojo, Yokoyama revealed that whilst the Yakuza series has sometimes offered English voice-acting, Like a Dragon: Ishin's "specialised vocabulary [...] would make the lines incredibly long", so the game will be translated into English via subtitles.

“No, [Western players] don’t really watch subtitled content," Yokoyama acknowledged in the interview (thanks, PC Gamer). "Especially in English speaking countries. That’s why they prefer to have voice overs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn Entertainment head and Battlefield franchise boss Vince Zampella has spoken about the reception - and failure - of the series' most recent entry, Battlefield 2042, suggesting it "strayed too far from" its roots.


Battlefield 2042 was dogged by technical issues and controversial design decisions when it launched last year, quickly attracting overwhelmingly negative reviews from players on Steam.


Since then, developer DICE has continued to tweak and expand on Battlefield 2042's wobbly base, but it's often felt like too little, too late - with publisher EA admitting the game's sales "did not meet expectations", saying, "Some of the design choices we made...did not resonate with everyone in our community".

That's according to PlayStation's SVP of platform experience, Hideaki Nishino, speaking in the latest episode of the Official PlayStation Podcast (jump to the 29:10 mark). "PSVR games are not compatible with PSVR2," he explained in answer to a question from the host, "because PSVR2 is designed to deliver a truly next-generation VR experience". 


Elaborating further, Nishino claimed the new elements of the PVSR2 hardware - inside-out tracking and eye-tracking, 3D audio, a 4K HDR display, and its controller with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback - meant "developing games for PSVR2 requires a whole different approach than the original PSVR."

And as for newcomers, "self-styled Chinatown peacekeeper" Jamie and "devoted student to Bushinryu" Kimberly were both confirmed to be along for the ride.


As of today, though, that earlier 11-strong line-up has seen seven more additions, with Capcom having now announced Street Fighter 6's full launch day roster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's good news for PlayStation-owning fans of developer Team Cherry's sublime Metroidvania, Hollow Knight. Its feverishly anticipated sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, has finally been confirmed for release on PS4 and PS5.


Hollow Knight: Silksong has, of course, been a long time coming, with Team Cherry first announcing the game all the way back in February 2019. Even now, some three and a half years later, specifics around Silksong remain limited, but we do at least know it'll offer a twist on its predecessor's non-linear exploration, platforming, and combat thanks to a new protagonist, Hornet, with her own distinct abilities.


Given how very excellent the original Hollow Knight was, that's still more than enough to warrant excitement, and Switch, Xbox, and PC players have been able to rest easy knowing Silksong would - eventually, at least - be available on their system to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After nearly eight years in development, an ambitious VR mod for Valve's seminal shooter Half-Life 2 finally launches on Steam today as a public beta.


Created by a group of modders going by the name of Source VR Mod Team, Half-Life 2: VR Mod has had a bit of a bumpy journey to release. Eurogamer first reported on the project back in 2017, but that version was actually an extension of an earlier mod released for Razer Hydra in 2013. Some time after, it disappeared into what the team recently called "its own kind of development hell", almost being abandoned, but eventually re-emerged in 2021.


The wait continued until last month, when Source VR Mod Team announced that, thanks to a "new influx of team members [that] revitalised" development, the Half-Life 2: VR project was poised to release, and that day is now here.

The detail, listed on the game's new Japanese website, has raised eyebrows since Symphonia on GameCube was presented in largely 60fps (with 30fps only for the world map).


Instead, this new remaster features a blanket 1080p 30fps across all three platforms: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

When asked whether Microsoft was prepared to go further than its recently-stated pledge - to keep COD on PlayStation for several more years - and perhaps promise it would remain on PlayStation in perpetuity, Spencer said his expectation was that Xbox would "continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation and other places".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a comeback we weren't expecting: 35-year old arcade rail shooter Operation Wolf is back in action.


French publisher Microids announced the imminent release of Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission, officially licensed by Taito and due out on consoles this autumn. It's also coming to VR in 2023.


All we have on this new game for now is a handful of screenshots, below, which show a new cartooney art style compared to the cult classic late-'80s arcade shooter. I'm sure this one's going to prove divisive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outer Wilds, the stellar time loop adventure - and Eurogamer Game of the Year 2019 - from developer Mobius Digital, has just received a next-gen upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Outer Wilds, if you're unfamiliar, casts players as tentative space explorers, slinging them into a miniature solar system of bizarre planets, absolutely stuffed with secrets. There's little direction, only a breadcrumb trail of clues hinting at a much larger mystery, and it all gradually opens out into glorious puzzle box, as ingenious as it is hauntig. And that's even before you start to grapple with the ramifications of the solar system resetting itself every 20 minutes.


It's great, then, but while Outer Wilds has technically been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S before now via backward compatibility, "playing...was not recommended because players could run into sections that weren’t optimised for the next-gen consoles, and encounter other backwards compatibility issues such as controller input lag" - as Mobius explains in a new post.

When Capcom previously discussed Title Update 2 at the end of last month, it confirmed that monster variant Flaming Espinas would be one ofits new additions. It's now announced two additional variants for the release - the aforementioned Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos - both appering in its latest update trailer.


There's not much information about the Violet Mizutsune just yet, but the Risen Chameleos is described as an Elder Dragon that has "overcome the affliction by achieving symbiosis with the Qurio, gaining great strength and new abilities". As such, it "poses an even greater danger than when they were still under the influence of the affliction" - so tread carefully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia - the striking multi-character survival horror from acclaimed developer Santa Ragione - finally has a release date, and will be inviting PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC players into its ever-shifting labyrinth on 27th October.


We're big fans of Santa Ragione's previous work, which includes MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, around these parts, and Saturnalia sounds just as intriguing. It's a survival horror adventure, of sorts - one heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - that sees players guiding four different characters through a mysterious ancient village steeped in murky rituals.


The goal of Saturnalia is to investigate, and ultimately solve, the mystery of village, but there are shadowy things in the night determined to stop you. Should you get captured as one character, you can switch to another and attempt a rescue - but once all four characters are dead, the village gets to reassert itself, its labyrinthine layout physically reconfiguring for another attempt. Narrative and puzzle progress, however, is retained across game-overs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following tonight's big Call of Duty blowout we finally have a release date for the much-anticipated Warzone 2.0 - plus we've plenty more details on what to expect. 


Warzone 2.0 is set to launch on 16th November, some two weeks after the launch of Modern Warfare 2 on 28th October. The pair will share the same engine, a first for the Call of Duty franchise and one that should ensure parity and a more consistent feature set - all of which makes this feel like something of a new dawn for the series. Warzone 2.0 introduces the new desert map of Al Mazrah, plus some of its own twists on the battle royale formula such as multiple circles appearing in certain end-game scenarios. It'll also feature a new AI faction, with Strong Holds harbouring loot patrolled by NPCs, and a tweaked Gulag system. There will also be a new sandbox mode called DMZ, and while details remain slim it does indeed sound like Warzone's take on Escape from Tarkov. 


Like other popular battle royale titles it will also feature a third-person view - something entirely new for Warzone 2.0, and an addition that will likely be the subject of some debate. Third-person playlists will also be available in Modern Warfare 2, harking back to the third-person mode that was available in the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 back in 2009.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego Bricktales, the beautiful diorama-based puzzler from developer ClockStone, finally has a release date and will be coming to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 12th October.


Announced back in March, Lego Bricktales sees players traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they, with the assistant of a cute robot pal, embark on a quest to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


The ensuing adventure offers a blend of puzzling and questing based around Lego Bricktales' brick-by-brick building mechanic, challenging players to come up with a solution to a particular task at hand by building something from a limited number of bricks - a bridge to cross a river, for instance, or a flyable, physics-based gyrocopter.

Norco unfolds in the "sinking suburbs and verdant industrial swamps" of a surreal, future South Louisiana, where players - in the role of a rebellious teenage girl - embark on a quest to find their brother, Blake, missing after the death of their mother.


What follows is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure, but one that aims in all sorts of directions, with Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell somewhat futilely summing it up as a "text-adventure, turn-based party battler, boat-navigating... poem... puzzler?" in his review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're back again this week for another Eurogamer Newscast, focusing on the recent Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play, plus the week's big news on the Yakuza franchise and what's next from Xbox Game Pass. It's been a busy week - full of Zelda, Pikmin, God of War and Yakuza 8 - but some corners of the internet are disappointed.


True, we didn't see some of the things we had expected might materialise. This week was not when we saw Wind Waker on Switch, Silent Hill on PlayStation, or got some kind of assurance Nintendo remembered what Metroid even was. But that's not to say there isn't plenty to look forward to.

Join Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan for our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom theories, thoughts on new Switch hardware, and our expert opinion on where to start with Yakuza.

One thief stands near you while you&#8217;re in the grocery store, intercepting your key&#8217;s transmitted signal with a radio transceiver. Another stands near your car, with another transceiver, taking the signal from their friend and passing it on to the car. Since the car and the key can now talk, through the thieves&#8217; range extenders, the car has no reason to suspect the key isn&#8217;t inside&#8212;and fires right up...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

What exactly these powers were was never disclosed, with Rose revealing that "even Chris" didn't know the full extent of what she could do thanks to her brush with the megamycete. 


However, a new trailer for Village's The Winter's Expansion DLC has shown off more from its new story, Shadows of Rose, including what these powers are.


Shared as part of Capcom's Tokyo Game Show presentation, this trailer reveals that Rose is actually able to freeze her enemies. So, very name appropriate.

The idea was that given there are over 1000 customisation items in MCC which were added over the years, it could be overwhelming for new players or those who only hop into the game occasionally.

Today, during a Tokyo Games Show livestream, Capcom said it had been working on securing a last-gen version of the game as well - and it had done so, but only for PS4.

If you haven't used it before, HowLongToBeat is a community run website where people can log how long it took them to beat a certain game. The times are then averaged to provide a rough estimate of the game's expected length.

It's by no means sound scientifically, but it's a nifty way of ballparking how much time you might need to finish a game's story before you commit to playing (or buying) it.

(Note: this is from a Pacific Time point of view. With time differences, it could be 3rd October elsewhere in the world.) Overwatch 2 will then launch 4th October and be the only Overwatch game in operation.
"So roughly a day before Overwatch 2 launches, we're going to be taking down the Overwatch 1 servers," commercial lead Jon Spector explained to me. "So that means, as a practical point, that October 2nd really is the last day to go in and play Overwatch 1. And then it's a 27-hour downtime that we're planning in order to get the Overwatch 2 server stood up and running. 
"We'll give current Overwatch players the ability to download Overwatch 2 a little bit ahead of when we launch, if they want to pre-download. There's also a couple of things that we'll be asking players to do, to get ready for Overwatch 2. We'll share a kind of launch checklist with players ahead of things so that they have a smooth experience getting in on 4th October, when we launch.

This blog describes the two features namely minReadySeconds for StatefulSets and maxSurge for DaemonSets that SIG Apps is happy to graduate to stable in Kubernetes 1.25.
Specifying minReadySeconds slows down a rollout of a StatefulSet, when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field, by waiting for each pod for a desired time.
This time can be used for initializing the pod (e.g. warming up the cache) or as a delay before acknowledging the pod.
maxSurge allows a DaemonSet workload to run multiple instances of the same pod on a node during a rollout when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field.
This helps to minimize the downtime of the DaemonSet for consumers.
These features …]]></summary>

Sony's live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Harbour is the first member of the cast to be officially revealed (thanks The Hollywood Reporter) and he'll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who's helming the project.


Blomkamp will be directing from a script by Jason Hall (American Sniper) and Zach Baylin (King Richard), which dramatises an apparently true story of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills put him on the path toward becoming a professional racecar driver.

And if you missed its typically meandering reveals, you can check out everything that put in an appearance, considerably more succinctly, below.

Eville


Eville is a multiplayer social deduction game from developer VestGames that's coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 11th October. It sees up to 13 players working together - or otherwise - in order to unmask Conspirators hiding in a village beset by murders. Those cast as Villagers must weed out the suspects by day, while those in the role of Conspirators can decide who should be bumped off next by night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities Skylines' 11th major expansion, Plazas and Promenades, has skipped the release date announcement pre-amble to surprise-launch on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC today.


Plazas and Promenades, which was announced back in August, brings a new pedestrianisation focus to developer Colossal Order's acclaimed city builder, giving players the tools needed to add pedestrian-only streets, pedestrian zones, and zone-specific policies.


Pedestrian Streets can be placed like any other road to create green city centres largely free of vehicles and pollution. These work in tandem with new pedestrian zones which can be augmented with new policies, such as Slow Driving (reducing the speed limit for all vehicles in the area to 20km an hour), and Street Music, which boosts happiness in pedestrianised commercial zones at the expense of noise pollution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years after its initial launch, EA's is making its enormously popular life sim The Sims 4 permanently free-to-play, beginning Tuesday, 18th October.


From that point onward, The Sims 4's base game (which is currently priced at £17.99/£19.99 USD) will be available to download at no cost across all platforms - that is, PC, Mac, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. There's no talk of pricing changes for the game's extensive DLC catalogue - which totals 12 Expansion Packs, 12 Game Packs, 18 Stuff Packs, and 15 Kit Packs at present - so it appears to be business as usual on that front for now.


In a post announcing today's news, EA said it will "continue to develop and release packs, kits and Sims Delivery Express drops into the foreseeable future" following The Sims 4 base game's transition to free-to-play, with more on its future plans set to be shared in a special developer livestream airing on 18th October at 6pm in the UK/10am PDT.

According to the official Nintendo website, you'll play as Alear "who awakens a thousand years after the war [between Elyos and the Fell Dragon] with no memory of their past". 

Perhaps that's the in-game explanation for the odd fashion choices for Alear, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Return to Monkey Island's release next week, I sat down with series creator Ron Gilbert, co-writer Dave Grossman and art director Rex Crowle to discuss the series' surprise revival. It's a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years (two years!) before its April Fool's Day announcement a few months ago. 
Speaking via video call, it was clear the trio had a great passion for what they do - and also an oversized Stan S. Stanman cutout, which loomed over Gilbert's shoulder. (This turned out to be a prop from a recent PAX trip liberated by Gilbert, thanks to the series' iconic distraction of "Look! A three-headed monkey". Apparently, this move works "every time".)
In addition to sharing more about Return to Monkey Island, including details of its under-wraps hint system, we spoke about the future of the series, scrapped plans to break up Guybrush and Elaine, and even ideas for Elaine Marley to lead her own game - as well as some Monty Python influences thrown in for good measure.

For non-Yakuza fans, it looks a bit confusing. Why are we so excited about an eight year old PS3/4 game being playable in English?

To explain, we need to look back on the Yakuza series as a whole.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced a western release for historical Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon: Ishin, which has been "rebuilt from the ground up" and will be making its way to PS4 and PS5 next February.


Like a Dragon: Ishin originally released for PS3 and PS4 in Japan (under the name Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!) back in 2014, transplanting the chaotic Yakuza formula to the Late Edo Period for a historical slice of samurai action.


It follows protagonist Sakamoto Ryōma as he returns to his home in Tosa where, after a run-in with a high-ranking samurai, he's sentenced to be executed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had an elusive tease at Evo earlier in the year, but now it is time for the real deal. Opening up Sony's State of Play, Tekken 8 was officially announced - no I am not Tekken the piss. 


This new teaser shows Kazuya and Jin Kazama facing off against each other on a suitably atmospheric backdrop wearing inappropriate clothing. The mother in me wants to get them both a jacket. But I digress. 


You can see this new teaser for Tekken 8 below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a similar move by Activision Blizzard last year, EA has unveiled EA AntiCheat (EAAC), a new internally developed kernel-level anti-cheat system that'll initially be rolling out with the launch of FIFA 23 on PC this autumn.


Announcing EAAC - which is officially described as a "kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution" - in a new blog post, the publisher explained, "PC cheat developers have increasingly moved into the kernel, so we need to have kernel-mode protections to ensure fair play and tackle PC cheat developers on an even playing field."


EAAC's arrival will coincide with the release of FIFA 23, which brings cross-play across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation to the series for the first time. "In addition to EAAC protecting our PC players from cheaters," EA notes, "our console players who match with PC opponents will also be protected from cheaters operating on PC platforms."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout 76's The Pitt update, which lets players leave the boundaries of Appalachia for the first time, is out today on Xbox and PC.


Announced back in June 2021, The Pitt - which is inspired by the Fallout 3 add-on of the same name - takes players to a city built on the remains of post-nuclear Pittsburgh, which can explore by embarking on Expeditions, a brand-new feature introduced in today's update.


Expeditions are essentially repeatable missions for up to four players that feature new NPCs and new foes to battle, with participants able to earn various in-game rewards for their endeavours. Bethesda says anyone can take part in these new activities but recommends that players be level 50+ "for the best experience".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a period of Xbox Insider testing announced earlier this year, Microsoft has officially launched Discord voice chat support for all Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S users.


As of today, anyone on either console will be able to connect directly to Discord Voice chats in order to talk with their friends, wherever they may be. The actual process required to do so, though, is a little convoluted, and first demands that users link their Xbox account to their Discord account - a process that'll need to be redone if done previously, so new permissions needed for voice chat on Xbox can be confirmed.


With that step complete, you'll next need to make sure you have the Xbox mobile app installed on your phone, and that you console is linked to the app. That done, fire up Discord on either your mobile device or desktop and join the Voice call you want to transfer to Xbox. From here, select the transfer call option, which will automatically open the Xbox mobile app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Nintendo Direct did not disappoint, with a brand new look at The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's sequel, the newly-titled Tears of the Kingdom, plus surprise announcements for Pikmin 4, GoldenEye 007 and a new Fire Emblem game. 
Nintendo finally confirmed Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's name and a release date: 12th May 2023 - plus new details on what to expect from Link's next adventure, which will apparently take him "to the vast lands of Hyrule... up into the skies and [into] an expanded world that goes beyond that."
Originally confirmed to Eurogamer by Shigeru Miyamoto in 2015, Nintendo finally gave us an official first teaser for Pikmin 4. I can't quite believe it's still in development, but it is, and it is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wube Software's much-loved construction and management sim Factorio will be making its way to Switch on 28th October.


Factorio, which has garnered a seemingly endless procession of rave reviews since entering Steam early access all the way back in 2016 (it got its full release in 2020), casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation.


Ultimately, the goal is to build a rocket ship and escape the planet you've crash-landed on - a process that begins by farming natural resources to create basic machines which, in turn, open up more and more construction possibilities the further you travel along the tech tree. Eventually, with the planet's hostile local wildlife dead and conveyor belts stretching as far as the eye can see, freedom should, hopefully, be yours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Nintendo Direct revealed a lot of surprises - including, of course, the long overdue re-reveal of Pikmin 4 seven whole years after Miyamoto first told us about it - but one of the biggest shocks didn't even get a place in the western broadcast. It turns out that Clap Hanz just quietly released its latest golf game on the eShop, rebranded as Easy Come, Easy Golf. 


It's effectively a re-release of Clap Hanz Golf, which we first saw on Apple Arcade last April, and which was the developer's first non-PlayStation foray. On PlayStation, Clap Hanz was behind the brilliant Everybody's Golf series, games we've been championing on Eurogamer for some time. Clap Hanz Golf was essentially more Everybody's Golf on a different platform - so to see it reborn on the Switch where it can be played with traditional controls is a very welcome thing indeed. 


You can find Easy Come Easy Golf on the Switch right now, where it currently costs £17.59.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix's upcoming fantasy farming game Harvestella is getting a Switch eShop demo today, ahead of its 4th November release.


Harvestella - a sort of blend of Final Fantasy, Harvest Moon, and Rune Factory - casts players as an amnesiac who wakes up in a world where the seasons are governed by four giant crystals known as Seaslight. Unfortunately for the locals, something has gone awry and a deadly dust known as the Quietus has started seeping from the crystals, trapping people indoors and causing crops to wither and die.


What follows is a familiar blend of farming, socialising, and adventuring that sees players growing crops to raise the money needed to buy new farming and adventuring equipment - the latter helping players gradually push deeper into Harvestella's dungeon-like regions where they'll encounter enemies and bosses, and gather resources required elsewhere.

If you're not familiar with Tunic, it's an indie game primarily developed by just one person, Andrew Shouldice, who was inspired by early Zelda games and their detailed manuals, particularly Zelda II - but don't let that put you off.

The sequel takes place in a new era and involves eight new characters whose adventures you'll get to individually play. The era appears to be more modern and reminds me of a kind of 18th/19th Century. There are huge, ocean-going ships but also trains of a kind, probably steam. And it looks as deliciously dinky and delicate as Octopath Traveler did before it.
Characters will also apparently now have different path actions at day and night, and there's specific mention of their stories intertwining in this game.

In 2017, I asked Miyamoto about the project again - and heard from the Nintendo legend that it was still progressing. I never gave up hope.

An early sample of the device, apparently left behind by accident, was recently discovered by hotel worker Ramiro Cardenas - after he responded to complaints of a pile of rubbish left in a bag in a corridor.


Cardenas, a VR fan, quickly realised what the device actually was - and promptly posted a series of photos and videos on the internet.

Future updates planned for the game have been scrapped, and its servers will go dark on 28th February next year. After that, you will no longer be able to log in and play.


Babylon's Fall only launched in March this year, but has struggled to attract players from the get-go. Square Enix confirmed it was pulling the plug this morning, and said it would run a final season of content from November until the game goes dark.

It's a late one for those of us in the UK, alas, kicking off at 11pm BST/3pm PT/6pm ET, but it should be decently eventful too, promising around 20 minutes of reveals, updates, and gameplay for a total of 10 games.


What those games are remains a mystery, but Sony does tease "great updates from our amazing Japanese partners, along with a few other surprises from developers all around the world".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New comments by Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot suggest the publisher will be adopting the increasingly industry standard $70 USD price point for its "big AAA" titles in the future.


It's a price point that's already been adopted by many publishers - including the likes of Sony, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox - on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, but Ubisoft, for its part, insisted it had "not made any decision yet" when asked about bumping its prices up during an investor call last year.


However, it seemed like the publisher might finally have made its mind up when, back in July, it announced its upcoming pirate adventure Skull and Bones would cost $70/£70 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S - and now CEO Guillemot has indicated this will be the norm going forward.

Free for Life is, according to Paradox, focussed on implementing the Prison Architect community's most requested features so "players can spend more time managing their compound rather than navigating menus".


To that end, it brings a range of enhancements, including an improved scheduler and prison log - the latter enabling players to more easily check inmates' activities, as well as "uncover misconducts ahead of time and keep track of who gets released, reformed, or reoffended".

Outside of the Animus, this past weekend was also a major moment for Ubisoft itself, as it emerged from a period of relative silence following a bruising few years of scandal, takeover rumours, and further discontent surrounding its NFT plans. If you missed it, I spoke with Ubisoft boss Yves Guillmot about all of that.
Ubisoft Forward seemed aptly named, with a look over the horizon to a brighter future for the company. But questions remain - as Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss.

At the time of writing, a US Xbox store listing still warns that Mirage contains "Intense Violence, Blood and Gore, Sexual Themes, Partial Nudity, Real Gambling", and lists it as having received the rare Adults Only 18+ label from the ESRB, the US' ratings board.


A UK listing similarly mentions "Real Gambling", alongside "Extreme Violence", and lists it with a PEGI 18+ rating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new 40-minute Nintendo Direct presentation will be broadcast tomorrow, Tuesday 13th September, at 3pm UK time.


We've been waiting a while for an update from Nintendo on the company's end of 2022 plans - as well as a sneak peek into 2023. Over the summer, we've heard various updates on new projects in a rather piecemeal fashion. And now the autumn's first big launch - Splatoon 3 - has arrived. 


So, what do we expect? Well, the Direct is well-timed to coincide with Tokyo Games Show later this week, where third-party publishers will be in attendance to demo upcoming Switch games. We're also hoping to hear more about Nintendo's own plans. Rumours abound of an update on Zelda and Metroid.

        <updated>2022-09-12T13:18:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix's Forspoken has been doing the rounds for a while - the second game built on the Luminous Engine that made its debut with Final Fantasy 15, it was at the forefront of the PlayStation 5's reveal when it was known as Project Athia and has had various public showings ahead of its release early next year, but perhaps its most impactful came after a trailer was posted on social media last month and was met with a rough response online, the dialogue becoming the butt of internet jokes.


"It was unexpected to see the reactions to the social media post," Forspoken's creative producer Raio Mitsuo told us after a recent opportunity to go hands-on with the game. "Basically, we used existing footage from previous trailers and put something together as a social media post. And yeah, it went kind of viral in a way - that's not the direction that we thought it was going to go! But I have to admit, some of the memes are actually pretty funny, so I got a good laugh out of it. 


"But, you know, for us, it's not something that we're concerned with. We're obviously leaving a lot of information on the table, because we're taking dialogue and scenes out of context. Forspoken is a very narrative driven game. It's a very story based game. We don't want to ruin the experience in our marketing campaign. We're being very selective about what to use to generate interest and sometimes without that information about what led up to that moment, or what was the character's state of mind, we're leaving the audience the full freedom to interpret lines in any way they want. It's just one of those challenges that come naturally when trying to find ways to show the game without telling the full story, because we definitely don't want to reveal that."

With the growing number of eyes on Kubernetes, the number of CVEs related to

A standalone, free-to-play addition to the The Division series, Heartland is a survival-action multiplayer shooter "set in small-town America within the Division universe". While initially it was expected to release in "2021-22", we're now looking at 2022-2023 on PC, consoles, and cloud.

"This standalone free-to-play The Division game introduces new playable characters in a rural setting, far from the events in New York and Washington D.C.," Ubisoft explains, confirming that Red Storm – a "veteran team who has worked on the franchise since the first The Division game" – is developing the shooter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has refuted claims that its game has been further delayed after Xbox began issuing refunds for pre-orders. 

Earlier this week, those who pre-ordered Stalker 2 began receiving messages informing them that their orders had been cancelled due to the fact that Stalker 2's release date has been pushed back to an "unconfirmed date in the future". At the same time, the pre-order option on the Xbox store was disabled.

Following Putin's illegal and barbaric invasion of Ukraine, the studio's home, GSC Game World initially put Stalker 2's development on hold, picking it up again once the studio was later relocated to Prague. Though originally slated to release in April this year, it was pushed to the first half of 2023 and the fact there's no solid date is reportedly why Xbox is offering refunds.

As confirmed at The Disney & Marvel Games Showcase, Empty Clip will be taking on the 27-year-old platformer and updating it to join "revived classics like The Jungle Book, Aladdin, and The Lion King" with "updated visuals and controls" and will be coming to unspecified "modern consoles" and PC.

Described as a "fan-favourite that's sure to have you screaming like a Viking yeeted by Goliath", Disney was keen to stress that we "have to wait to climb back into the world of Gargoyles Remastered", so we probably shouldn't expect it any time soon (thanks, PC Gamer).

Sadly, it doesn't look like any Europeans or players with Apple devices can get involved just yet.

Set in feudal Japan, Assassin's Creed: Project Red will arrive at some point after 2023. It's described as an open-world RPG, a chance for fans to live out their powerful shinobi fantasy, and is in development by the talented Quebec-based team behind Assassin's Creed Odyssey.


Sometime after that, Assassin's Creed: Project Hexe will be next to launch. Details are extremely thin, but it looks to be a mysterious, witchcraft-inspired entry, and is being worked on by the Valhalla team at Ubisoft Montreal.

On Thursday, in Paris, at a briefing attended by Eurogamer, Guillemot described the moment as a "stumble" which the company had since acknowledged and learned from.

The platform will also serve as the new, dedicated home to Assassin's Creed's modern day story, which will progress separately to upcoming games Codename Red, set in feudal Japan, and Codename Hexe, which looks to be set in 16th century Europe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Ubisoft Forward event has revealed a first glimpse at Mirage, next year's new Assassin's Creed adventure - although we're still waiting for a look at gameplay, and there's still no firmer release date than "2023". 

Still, we now know much more about Mirage than we did through this year's drip-feed of leaks from around the internet - and from Ubisoft itself. And this week, I sat down with several of the game's Bordeaux-based development team for a deeper dive into what was shown publicly today. Read on for details of djinn, a popular rumour seemingly being denied, and more details on that Prince of Persia crossover.

Mirage is set in Baghdad and begins in the year 861, when the city enjoyed a golden age where it was a commercial and cultural crossroads. It was home to all manner of faces from all parts of the known world - a perfect cast for an Assassin's Creed game - and also, of course, future Master Assassin himself, Basim Ibn Ishaq. When the game begins, we meet Basim several decades before his journey to England and arrival in the story of 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Here, on the streets of Baghdad, Basim begins as a petty thief, who catches the eye of the Hidden Ones.

Ubisoft has promised this show will reveal the "future" of Assassin's Creed, beginning with next year's Baghdad-set stealth game Mirage. But we're hoping and expecting much more as well - including a look, and hopefully some concrete details, on the company's ambitious-sounding Infinity platform for the future of the franchise.

Valve says that should you "encounter an issue" with its new handheld system, you can send your Steam Deck for repair or replacement via one of its repair centres, where the team will "diagnose the device, repair if needed, then ship the fixed unit back to you".

Whilst in-warranty repairs will be carried out free of charge, Valve does remind players that "if your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty", although repair centres will repair accidental damage "for a fee". Otherwise, Steam Deck owners are invited to "fix things yourself" with repair kits, replacement parts, and guides all available at iFixit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A now-deleted Epic Games Store graphic suggests Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is coming to PC next month.

Though the store page was almost instantly pulled down and amended, it wasn't quick enough to fool the internet, which managed to catch a proposed release date of 19th October, 2022.

Looks like there'll be a Fortnite-flavoured pre-order bonus, too; a "snazzy new Fortnite glider in the shape of Sully's seaplane".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised, Disney has shared a first official tease for Amy Hennig's now marginally less mysterious Marvel project - although solid details, including a name, still remain elusive.


Announced last October, few official details have so-far been shared about the project - currently in development at Skydance New Media, the studio Hennig set up in 2019 - beyond the fact it'll be a "narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure" set in the Marvel universe.


And while solid details are still hard to come by, today's teaser trailer does appear to confirm rumours circling yesterday - understood to be true by Eurogamer - that Hennig's game would be set in WW2, and see Captain America and Black Panther battling the forces of Hydra.

Announced last August, Marvel's Midnight Suns - which draws inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s - is superhero strategy game that follows a roster of familiar faces on an adventure blending turn-based combat, card-battling, and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building.


Midnight Suns was originally due to launch in March this year but was delayed last November in order to add "more story, cinematics and overall polish". Unfortunately, as its revised 7th October approached, publisher 2K and Firaxis made the decision to delay it once more to deliver the best possible experience for everyone."

The adventure was warmly received on release, with Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell calling it a "masterpiece of meat and malice" in his Recommended review.

Deviation Games' partnership with Sony was made public in June 2021, with the announcement only going as far as to say the 100-person studio was currently working on a "brand-new original IP", said to have already been in development for a year at the time.


Blundell's departure from Deviation - which comes even before the studio's first title has been officially revealed - was announced in a statement shared on Twitter. It did not elaborate further on Blundell's leaving, only saying," We appreciate the contributions Jason has made and we wish him the best in his future endeavours".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are lots of very good things about From Software's majestic Elden Ring, but one of the very best good things - as is the case with much of the developer's games - is its sublime soundtrack. And now publisher Bandai Namco has made the entire thing officially available to listen to across a wide range of music streaming services.


The newly released digital soundtrack runs a total of 34 tracks, variously composed by Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Yuka Kitamura, Yoshimi Kudo, and Tai Tomisawa - many of whom are long-time From Software collaborators, having worked on the likes of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Bloodborne.


Their cumulative expertise on Elden Ring, though, has created a belter of a soundtrack, and now users of Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, the iTunes Store, YouTube Music, Tidal, Qobuz, and Deezer can relive their adventures in the Lands Between through the power of sonic reminiscence. Full links can be found here.

<blockquote><p>Why can’t the cryptocurrency industry solve the problem the way the software and hardware industries do, by patching and updating security as flaws are found? Two reasons: First, many customers don’t have an ongoing relationship with the hardware and software providers that protect their funds­&#8212;nor do they have an incentive to update security on a regular basis. Turning to a new security provider or using updated software creates risks; leaving everything the way it was feels safer. So users won’t be rushing to pay for and install new security patches...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just days after releasing an updated early access roadmap for Phasmophobia, developer Kinetic Games has announced the ghost hunting sim's next big patch - known as the Apocalypse Update - will be arriving on 27th September.


There's a lot going on in Phasmophobia's Apocalypse Update, starting with the arrival of the new Sunny Meadows Mental Institution map - an entirely reworked, more visually interesting, and, crucially, more compact version of the game's previously released Asylum map.


A recent poll suggested smaller maps were high on the list of players' wants, and - intentionally or otherwise - the Apocalypse Update seems to be delivering on that front. Not only is a smaller Sunny Meadows variant known as 'Restricted' included - offering "5 small maps in 1" - it also adds Camp Woodwind, a miniature variant of the Maple Lodge Campsite map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has spoken out against Microsoft's offer to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for "at least several more years" beyond Sony's existing agreement with publisher Activision Blizzard, calling the deal "inadequate on many levels" - despite Microsoft's insistence it went "well beyond typical gaming industry agreements".


It's the latest shot fired in an increasingly public back and forth between the two companies as governmental scrutiny of Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard grows, particularly in relation to its impact on other gaming platforms. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority, for instance, recently said the deal would give rise to the "realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services."


It's in this climate that Xbox boss Phil Spencer last week attempted to placate concerns it might be looking to make the hugely popular Call of Duty series - which the CMA called "important and capable of making a material difference to the success of rivals' gaming platforms" - an Xbox exclusive if the acquisition gained approval, insisting that it had "provided a signed agreement to Sony [in January] to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's probably not much of a surprise given CD Projekt's previous assertion that its currently in-development new Witcher game would mark the start of a "new saga for the franchise", but the studio has now explicitly confirmed it's already "thinking about" new instalments beyond that.


Asked to elaborate on the company's use of the word "saga" during CD Projekt's latest earnings call, president and joint CEO Adam Kiciński clarified that "like the first saga was three games...we are in pre-production of the first game from the second Witcher saga." As such, the studio is  already "thinking about more than one game".


Hardly a shocking revelation, admittedly, but additional clarity is always welcome.

"In Humankind," Amplitude explains in its announcement," we’ve always wanted there to be more ways to win than simple military domination. And while the game’s unified victory condition, Fame, was a first step towards that, we’re now ready to take things much further".


To that end, Together We Rule (which follows several smaller culture-focused DLC packs) will introduce new features - including the Congress of Humankind, Embassies, and Agents - that are intended to "help players see the world in a new light and resolve conflicts differently".

Those include adjustable-tension thumbsticks, a wrap-around rubberised grip, and shorter hair trigger locks. It also supports button mapping via the Xbox Accessories app, and features a rechargeable battery capable of up to 40 hours of play on one charge. And, yes, it's white.

With regards to its game AeternoBlade 2, Corecell claimed that PQube "only paid a small part of the minimum guarantee of the signing milestone by the time we sent them the game and they never paid the remaining milestones", among other issues over publishing control.

The small card shared on the MultiVersus Twitter feed states that Gizmo will have a move called "Gizmo-A-Go-Go". This will see Gizmo attaching himself onto the back of his allies. He will also be able to "sing and spawn musical note projectiles" that will damage nearby enemies thanks to a move called Song of the Mogwai.

Some Kubernetes components (such as kubelet and kube-proxy) create
iptables chains and rules as part of their operation. These chains
were never intended to be part of any Kubernetes API/ABI guarantees,
but some external components nonetheless make use of some of them (in
particular, using KUBE-MARK-MASQ to mark packets as needing to be
masqueraded).
As a part of the v1.25 release, SIG Network made this declaration
explicit: that (with one exception), the iptables chains that
Kubernetes creates are intended only for Kubernetes’s own internal
use, and third-party components should not assume that Kubernetes will
create any specific iptables chains, or that those chains will contain
any specific rules if they do exist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Fawn's The Wandering Village - a city building sim set on the back of a giant, roaming creature - will be launching into Steam early access next Wednesday, 14th September.


Announced last August, The Wandering Village tasks players with constructing a safe haven for a group of survivors in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world. Its city building aspects might be familiar, but those are combined with resource management, rogue-like elements, and survival, all connected to the ever-moving creature, known as Onbu, the survivors now call home.


"Forging a relationship between the villagers and Onbu might be challenging at times, as their interests often don’t align," Stray Fawn explains. "As a living creature, its unique body poses its own challenges for your village design. There's every chance a spike may have grown where villagers intended to place their kitchen, while a failed harvest may cause desperation and tempt villagers to draw blood from the creature for food."

And that milestone coincides with the opening of nominations for the next filth-encrusted edifice to be added to the game.


There's not much more to say on the 3m players front, which Futurlab announced on Twitter earlier today, other than to say its success is thoroughly well-deserved. Eurgamer's Robert Purchese - who wrote about the serene pleasures of PowerWash Simulator's sedate busywork in July - is far from the only member of the editorial team to have fallen in love with its daffy charms and compulsive rhythms.


And if, like me, you've reached the end of PowerWash Simulator's gloriously ludicrous campaign and urgently require more things to blast back into the realms of cleanliness, the good news is FuturLab is currently working on new additions - with the developer currently taking suggestions for what should come next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of this weekend's Ubisoft Forward digital showcase, a new report has claimed the event will offer a look at three previously unannounced Assassin's Creed titles - one set in Japan, another in 16th century Europe, and a third in China.


Earlier this week, Ubisoft confirmed it would be 'unveiling the future' of the Assassin's Creed franchise during this Saturday's digital showcase, but stopped short of providing specifics. A look at the recently recently confirmed Assassin's Creed Mirage seemed a certainty, but a new report has suggested the publisher might in fact have a lot more its ready to share.


According to relentlessly leaky (and usually reliable) journalist Tom Henderson, writing for Try Hard Guides, Ubisoft Forward's Assassin's Creed portion will indeed begin with a "deep dive" into Assassin's Creed Mirage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With God of War Ragnarök inching ever closer to its 9th November release on PlayStation, the pre-launch pre-amble keeps on coming, this time with a closer look at the dwarven realm of Svartalfheim in a new video.


Svartalfheim is, of course, one of the Nine Realms at the heart of God of War's current Norse-themed saga, and one of three - alongside Vanaheim and Asgard - that were unreachable in the first game. Players will finally be able to complete the set in Ragnarök, though, as well as getting a chance to return to previously visited realms to explore new locations.


Svartalfheim, like other realms, can be accessed via the gateway located at the centre of the Lake of Nine (frozen over in Ragnarök thanks to the onset of Fimbulwinter) and - as detailed in a new GameInformer video - will present players with plenty of dwarven ingenuity to explore, including mine pits, artificial water channels, and sprawling cities.
