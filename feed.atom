        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2020, developer Kaizen Game Works unleashed its dizzyingly high-concept open-world detective adventure Paradise Killer on Switch and PC, while PlayStation and Xbox owners were left eyeing up its woozy blend of sun-kissed investigatory action and eldritch nightmare from the sidelines. That's all set to change, however, with an expanded version of Paradise Killer finally heading to Xbox and PlayStation on 16th March.
In its original guise, Paradise Killer was wonderfully idiosyncratic, a breathlessly stylish blend of visual novel and exploratory open-world murder mystery unfolding on the gaudy, sun-drenched Paradise 24 - part tropical island retreat, part shrine to a pantheon of preposterous cosmic gods - where players, in the role of Lady Love Die, must hunt for clues and cross-examine suspects to discover exactly who horrifically butchered the island's ruling council.

<p>From the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this work, we expose the cryptographic design and implementation of Android&#8217;s Hardware-Backed Keystore in Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S8, S9, S10, S20, and S21 flagship devices. We reversed-engineered and provide a detailed description of the cryptographic design and code structure, and we unveil severe design flaws. We present an IV reuse attack on AES-GCM that allows an attacker to extract hardware-protected key material, and a downgrade attack that makes even the latest Samsung devices vulnerable to the IV reuse attack. We demonstrate working key extraction attacks on the latest devices. We also show the implications of our attacks on two higher-level cryptographic protocols between the TrustZone and a remote server: we demonstrate a working FIDO2 WebAuthn login bypass and a compromise of Google&#8217;s Secure Key Import...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After some eight years since the last numbered instalment, Polyphony Digital's flagship PlayStation series returns today with Gran Turismo 7 - and going live alongside it on the PlayStation Store are some microtransactions which represent a slightly tweaked approach to the one we saw in Gran Turismo Sport. 
The microtransactions in Gran Turismo Sport - released in a post-launch update - had players buying individual cars at a set price, with only those of a value up to 2 million in-game credits available for purchase. Gran Turismo 7, however, does away with that restriction and simply offers in-game currency for sale, starting at £1.99 for 100,000 credits all the way to £15.99 for 2,000,000 credits.

Genesis Noir did, of course, dazzle at launch last year, melding exploratory point-and-click-style tinkering with stylish audio-visual presentation - a blend of Saul-Bass-inspired animation and smooth jazz soundtrack, both in service to a strange whodunnit yarn spanning space and time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Adeline Software's much-loved Little Big Adventure series will soon be able to play both instalments with a selection of newly implemented modern day niceties, including cloud saves and controller support, thanks to refresh work currently underway at developer 2.21.
The original Little Big Adventure - an evocative blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that charted the story of young hero Twinsen, on the run from evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994 and was followed by a sequel three years later. With both titles now over a quarter of a century old, they are, understandably, rather lacking in terms of modern day polish, and 2.21 is looking to remedy that as it seeks to bring the games to more players ahead of its planned third instalment in the Little Big Adventure series.

When Ubisoft first revealed it would be revisiting the Settlers' much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula in a new series instalment, it told fans to expect the title in autumn the following year. As that window approached, however, it announced it was pushing the game into 2020 - but that delay was extended indefinitely as summer 2020 rolled around.

Worse still, a recent SEC filing highlighted "significant debt" for Intellivision and suggested that, having made no revenue since its inception, the company may not be able to operate beyond July 2022 without additional funds - despite 6,000 pre-orders for Amico still being unfulfilled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RimWorld, developer Ludeon Studios' widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim, has been refused classification in Australia, preventing its release and effectively banning it from sale. 
It's a decision that, on the one hand, isn't particularly surprising given the Australian Classification Board notorious sensitivity around certain issues in games - RimWorld is, after all, a simulation whose incredibly deep systems make drug-fuelled cannibalism an entirely legitimate pastime for colonists - but it's also a little peculiar, insofar as RimWorld has been available to purchase on PC in Australia for nearly five years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long wait, but Steam Deck is now out in the wild. For those that didn't make the head of the queue when reservations opened last July, however - and who are currently eyeing up a rather non-specific ETA for their unit - Valve has a bit of promising news, saying production of its new portable gaming PC will be "in the hundreds of thousands" by next month.
That's according to Valve designer Lawrence Yang who, in conversation with IGN, explained the company expects production to "ramp very quickly" as it continues "surmounting" the initial supply chain issues that led to Steam Deck's delay last year. "Very quickly we'll be in the tens of thousands [of units produced]," Yang revealed. "By the second month we'll be in the hundreds of thousands, and beyond that it'll grow even quicker".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nice piece of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08477">research</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Among the many types of malicious codes, ransomware poses a major threat. Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker&#8217;s RSA private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware. It is expected that our method can be used to reduce the damage caused by Hive ransomware...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Valve does, however, have some hitherto unseen Portal on the way for your tearily grateful playing pleasure in the form of a free interactive tutorial thingy for Steam Deck - titled Aperture Desk Job and launching next week.
Admittedly, "interactive tutorial" sounds neither riveting nor sexy, which is probably why Valve is referring to its new Steam Deck experience as a "free playable short". But what actually is it?, you may be wondering.

Back in October, Valve made a stand by banning all blockchain games from its Steam platform, updating its policy documents to reflect the change. The move was well-received by the wider community, though the developer of Age of Rust - one of the games impacted by the new policy - went into a bit more detail, claiming that Steam didn't want to allow items of real-world value on its store.

At the time, Sony was said to be aiming for a "spring" release, and a new report has suggested the service is now "pretty close to actually launching".

And now, if a new report proves true, there may be a glimmer of hope on the horizon, with "very early" discussions for a sequel said to be taking place between Microsoft and Obsidian.
That's according to VentureBeat's Jeff Grubb who, speaking in the latest episode of his Giantbomb show Grubbsnax (as spotted and transcribed by VGC), revealed, "This is very early, but people have begun to have talks and say these words in sentences, and these words are 'Obsidian' and 'New Vegas 2'". Grubb added, "A lot of people at Microsoft think that this could work and there's a lot of interest to make it happen."

Curious about what her commute would be like when the pandemic was over, she searched for the company&#8217;s office address. The result looked nothing like the videos on Madbird&#8217;s website of a sleek workspace buzzing with creative-types.

Featuring both co-op play and, as of last year, a PvP versus mode, Legends was made available as a £16/$20/€20 standalone release last September, giving purchasers the option to upgrade to Ghost of Tsushima's Director's Cut at a discounted price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although it would admittedly be entirely forgivable if you'd forgotten about The Last of Us' live-action TV adaptation given the sheer tsunami of other video game adaptations in the works right now, those that'd been hoping to see Sony's acclaimed blockbuster brought to life on the small-to-mid-sized screen at some point this year will have to wait a little longer - HBO has now confirmed the series won't be airing until next year at least.
It's perhaps not a total shock given recent word on the project indicated filming in Alberta, Canada was still ongoing and would continue until July, but HBO chief content officer Casey Bloys has now made it official. "It's not going to air in 2022," he told Deadline, "they are still shooting in Canada. I imagine you will see it in '23".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years after its launch, there's a hell of a lot to love about No Man's Sky; its rudimentary combat system, however, isn't really one of them, barely having evolved since the exploratory space sim's initial release back in 2016. That, though, is set to change with today's new Sentinel update, which brings with an much-needed combat overhaul along with AI mechs and robotic drone pals, plus other miscellaneous combat-focused additions.
According to Hello Games, Sentinel - No Man's Sky's first update of 2022 - is intended to make combat a more "dynamic and impactful" experience, providing the means to tackle the game's hostile robotic Sentinels in "more meaningful ways" To that end, the update brings with it a broad array of improvements and refinements focused on enhancing combat feel and flow, as detailed in the latest patch notes. The headline features, however, are highlighted below.

<blockquote><p>tl;dr</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, vendors took an average of 52 days to fix security vulnerabilities reported from Project Zero. This is a significant acceleration from an average of about 80 days 3 years ago.
<li>In addition to the average now being well below the 90-day deadline, we have also seen a dropoff in vendors missing the deadline (or the additional 14-day grace period). In 2021, only one bug exceeded its fix deadline, though 14% of bugs required the grace period.
<li>Differences in the amount of time it takes a vendor/product to ship a fix to users reflects their product design, development practices, update cadence, and general processes towards security reports. We hope that this comparison can showcase best practices, and encourage vendors to experiment with new policies.

Ensuring the reliability of SIG Node upstream code is a continuous effort
that takes a lot of behind-the-scenes effort from many contributors.
There are frequent releases of Kubernetes, base operating systems,
container runtimes, and test infrastructure that result in a complex matrix that
requires attention and steady investment to "keep the lights on."
In May 2020, the Kubernetes node special interest group ("SIG Node") organized a new
subproject for continuous integration (CI) for node-related code and tests. Since its
inauguration, the SIG Node CI subproject has run a weekly meeting, and even the full hour

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog's second movie outing is still months from release, but already Sega would like you to know that a third entry in the unexpectedly endearing live-action series is on the way. And if that wasn't enough live-action Sonic-themed news to be getting on with, how about this: Knuckles is also set to start in his very own TV show.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, given how far out both projects still appear to be, details remain relatively scant beyond their official announcement; there's one bit of major news, however, with Paramount Pictures confirming Idris Elba - who's set to makes his debut as Knuckles in the second Sonic movie - will be reprising his role as the cocky echidna in the live-action television show, said to be airing on Paramount Plus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been eyeing up Star Wars: Hunters - Zynga's upcoming free-to-play arena shooter, set in a galaxy far, far away - your curiosity may be passingly piqued by its latest reveals, covering a new game mode, two new maps, and two new Hunters eager to join the fray.
Given that Hunters is sort of doing its own thing in a cartoon-y corner of the Star Wars universe, neither of its new characters are exactly familiar faces, but like the boulder-throwing Wookie hunter, droid Jedi, and Jawas duo revealed previously, they do at least fit comfortably within the Star Wars oeuvre. There's Sprocket - a Mon Calamari who can control an arsenal of droids, capable of injuring opponents and protecting allies, from the comfort of his custom Command Chair - and Skora, a Rodian cartel doctor that can heal and harm with her dart gun.

As with the similarly hued PlayStation Studios animation that precedes all of Sony's recent games, the new PlayStation Productions ident serves up a star-studded roster of iconic PlayStation characters, including God of War's Kratos (and BOY), Uncharted's Nathan Drake, Horizon's Alloy, The Last of Us' Joel and Ellie, Ratchet & Clank, Astrobot, and more.

Activision Blizzard has, of course, been the focus of months of disturbing allegations surrounding its workplace culture following the launch of a State of California lawsuit calling the company a "breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women" - made all the more unsettling after a damning Wall Street Journal report claimed Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick had been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company "for years".

If A Highland Song looks familiar, that might be because Inkle hasn't been particularly secretive about its latest project, sharing some of its early production work on the title via regular updates on its blog. Today, however, marks its official unveiling, bringing with it an immediately arresting, wonderfully evocative reveal trailer.

Salt and Sacrifice, as is amply evident from its release date trailer below, reprises much that made the original so good, serving up another deliciously gloomy slab of side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat. It promises to be more than a retread of past glories, however, offering players - this time in the role of a Marked Inquisitor - a range of new features to experiment with, including a refreshed choice of classes: Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rapidly growing number of Battlefield 2042 players have signed a petition demanding refunds for their purchase of EA's troubled shooter, accusing the publisher of "false advertising" and of launching the game in an "unplayable" state.
It has, of course, been a bumpy few months for Battlefield 2042; just days after its release last November, the DICE-developed shooter gained the unenviable accolade of being one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time. Eurogamer's Martin Robinson was equally damning, going as far as to call its launch "a disaster", writing, "Since Battlefield 2042 went live on Friday, I've endured hard crashes, server problems and whole nights where the whole thing is simply unplayable...This is another Battlefield that's launching in a sorry state."

As spotted by VGC, Bandai Namco made the announcement as part of its newly released mid-term plan spanning April 2022 to March 2025. In the document, the publisher introduces a new speech-bubble-inspired logo (said to express "the potential of the brand to connect with people around the world through dreams, fun and inspiration") alongside an initial outline for what it's calling its new "IP axis strategy".

The bulk of My Wedding Stories was accurately leaked at the tail-end of last week, but for those of you not perusing Eurogamer late into Friday night, the gist is that it gives players the tools needed to craft a surprisingly comprehensive wedding experience for their Sims - right from the proposal all the way through to vow renewals many years later.

Update 2.15 brings a number of addtions to developer Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut, but it's the Horizon Forbidden West crossover that takes centre stage, giving players the opportunity to unlock a new outfit for Jin Sakai that has a distinct air of Aloy about it.

And it seems Platinum itself is still eager to see the project reach fruition, now saying it "wants to discuss [its resurrection] with Microsoft properly".
Scalebound first surfaced during Microsoft's E3 showcase back in 2014, promising to transport players to a hostile world where - in the role of a cocky teen with a massive sword - they'd take on enormous creatures, with a little help from their dragon pal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have played Bioshock Infinite's Burial at Sea DLC you will have no doubt witnessed a boy dancing on the Parisian streets as he joyously holds a stick of French bread aloft (he is not exactly hard to miss). While a charming inclusion in its own right, the mastermind behind Bioshock's "Bread Boy" has now revealed more insight into why he is there.
It was a simple fan post from Twitter user Pocklecool that once more brought "Bread Boy" back to the fore of our minds, commenting on the fact that the game's shorthand for being in Paris was a small boy delightedly twirling a baguette in his arms. The tweet, perhaps understandably, blew up, catching the attention of Gwen Frey.

Tim Sweeney, founder and CEO of Epic Games, was recently asked by Twitter user Stormy178 if there were "any plans to update [Fortnite] to make Proton/Wine be compatible with EAC and BattleEye anti-cheat on Linux?". To this, Sweeney replied with a swift no. He did, however, reiterate there is a "big effort underway to maximize Easy Anti Cheat compatibility with Steam Deck" (via PC Gamer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite originally launching back in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V remains a force to be reckoned with; according to Take-Two's latest quarterly earnings report, Rockstar's irrepressible open-world opus has managed to shift another 5m copies since November, bringing its lifetime sales up to 160m - and the publisher also had a little more to say about NFTs.
Alongside Grand Theft Auto V's quarterly rise, Take-Two's updated numbers show a continuing boost for the GTA series as a whole, which has now sold over 370 million units - an increase of 15m since November. However, as the publisher opted not to share sales data for its much-maligned GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, it's unclear how much the troubled remaster contributed to that remaining 10m figure - although CEO Strauss Zelnick did say the game had "significantly exceeded" the company's commercial expectations.

That's according to Montreal-based French-language publication Le Devoir (via Google Translate), which sheds a little more light on Haven's ambitions - with accompanying quotes from Raymond and fellow co-founders - as part of a short profile piece on the studio.

SIG Multicluster is the SIG focused on how Kubernetes concepts are expanded and used beyond the cluster boundary.
