        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its latest earnings report, CD Projekt has offered an revised breakdown of the projects currently occupying the studio's time, confirming the "bulk of" its development capacity is now focused on Cyberpunk 2077's story expansion, which is still expected to launch next year.


Following Cyberpunk's disastrous release at the tail-end of 2020, the majority of CD Projekt's development resources (as shown in the chart below) were focused on remedying the game's most pressing issues. At the same time, a smaller team was working on its next-gen release, promised long before the project's launch woes, and an even smaller group was doing preliminary work on its paid expansion.


Inevitably, those numbers have shifted considerably over time - less than half of CD Projekt's development staff were working on Cyberpunk's base game and next-gen update by June last year, for instance - and that trend has, unsurprisingly, continued. As per today's financial results, Cyberpunk 2077 support has "shrunk considerably" following the release of its next-gen update (which CD Projekt says had "a positive effect on the game's perception and sales figures"), with the "bulk of [the studio's] development capacity" now working on its expansion.

During a Q&A on the Gotham Knights Discord, creative director Patrick Redding revealed Nightwing's Flying Trapeze was inspired by "a couple of ideas" including some classic issues in the Nightwing solo book that saw the DC hero using his "aerialist moves with jet-powered gliders".
Additionally, the team wanted it to feel as though Nightwing had been through the late, great, Batman's arsenal.

"Our first step when designing the map was to decide where the bosses would appear, especially the important ones," said Miyazaki. "Therefore, the map was really designed on the basis of boss gameplay, then we adjusted the boss gameplay based on their location on the map."

"You don't see it in the executive ranks, you don't see it in the leadership ranks of key developers. It's incredibly difficult to find it in various games," he points out.

Twitch streamer BushyGames has released a YouTube video explaining his build and methodology - and, of course, including the boss battles themselves.


For the challenge, he gave himself free reign on strategies, abilities, and weapons, but only one attack per enemy or per boss phase (for those with multiple phases) was allowed. The (arguably overpowered) sorcery Comet Azur was also not allowed.

EA, as with the majority of companies, has not. Nor has it publicly made a specific statement on legal issues threatening transgender rights, which are ongoing in several states. Now, speaking via a town hall meeting leaked to Kotaku, its chief people officer Mala Singh was asked why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has called out Microsoft executives (both former and current) for their poor behaviour towards staff, including instances of verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 
Insider (via Windows Central) reported that Microsoft's Alex Kipman, Terry Myerson and Tom Keane have all been accused of creating a toxic workplace environment during their time with the company.
Most notably, and incredibly disturbingly, Kipman (who currently oversees Microsoft's metaverse efforts) is reported to have watched inappropriate footage via a VR headset, which was then projected onto an external screen, while in room full of his colleagues.

In a new presentation to investors, Sony also said it had a God of War TV show in development for Amazon, and a further Gran Turismo pitch it was also working on.

There's no word on plot details for Horizon - or any of the above projects - or word on when we might see them materialise. Still, hopefully someone at Sony is talking to Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie right now and asking about her availability.

Numerous users reported via social media that they had been told they would have to pay up for any difference in pricing - achieved via stacking or from redeeming discounted PlayStation Plus offers - for the full term of their remaining subscription balance. It was a situation that left some with eye-opening charges to suddenly cough up.


Now, following general confusion and a good deal of online backlash, Sony has finally acknowledged the situation and termed it as a "technical error" which "has been fixed".

In a financial presentation last night, Sony exec Jim Ryan noted that, despite a strong launch, PS5 sales were lagging behind PS4 in its equivalent second year owing to supply constraints.


Those supply constraints are due to both the Covid pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine, but remain a top priority for Sony.

It's Le Mans month! And what better way to whet your appetite than by taking to the wheel of the winner of last year's race, Toyota's GR010 hypercar which today makes its video game debut in Gran Turismo 7 thanks to its latest update. 


Oh, there are some other cars too - namely a new GT Vision Suzuki and an outrageous beefed up Camaro going under the Roadster Shop Rampage name. They come alongside some new Scapes in New Orleans to snap your cars - and once you're done admiring the new cars you can take part in the Gran Turismo World Series which is kicking off in Gran Turismo 7 this weekend, with the preliminary rounds open to all-comers taking place on 27th May and 28th May. 


The World Series grand finale will be returning to a real life event in Monte Carlo this November - a fitting backdrop for what's become one of the glitziest online racing competitions in recent years, and one that's delivered some decent action too.

The original For The King, if you're unfamiliar, was a thoroughly entertaining (if sometimes brutally challenging) blend of familiar RPG stables - think dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - streamlined into a light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure.


More than anything, it was a wonderfully designed little story generator - encompassing everything from haunted carnivals to suffocating jungles - with enough potential combinations across its moving parts to feel sufficiently different each run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator's free Top Gun: Maverick expansion has remained something of a mystery since its announcement last June, but now, with the update finally here on Xbox and PC, developer Asobo has detailed exactly what to expect when it's fired up for the first time.


One notable oddity of the Top Gun expansion is that it'll be launching without what's arguably its biggest feature: the F/A-18E Super Hornet. However, that's only because Asobo made the decision to release the plane early as part of last year's free Game of the Year Edition update when the expansion was delayed alongside the Top Gun: Maverick movie.


Even without the plane as its flagship addition, though, there's still plenty for simmers to grapple with, starting with three training missions for the F/A-18E, all designed to help pilots master "radical flight maneuvers including unrestricted take-offs, split S maneuvers, and low altitude, high-speed maneuvering through complex terrain."

First up in terms of major new features is multiplayer, currently scheduled to arrive some time this "summer". Details are scarce at this juncture, but Funcom's roadmap makes reference to both co-op play and "free-for-all" PvP, with up to four players supported at one time.


Also due this summer is a brand-new faction, but specifics are even more limited in this case. All we're getting for the time being is the tease of a suitably mysterious silhouette and a note that the faction will include a "new victory condition".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barely a month has gone by since the arrival of No Man's Sky's major Outlaws update, which gave intergalactic explorers the opportunity to live out their pirate fantasies, but already Hello Games is back - this time with a brand-new expedition that finally answers fan pleas to add space whales (of a sort) to the exploratory sim.
Expeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are effectively No Man's Sky's stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle its various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. And today's addition, titled Leviathan, is a very different proposition to April's The Blighted, and sounds considerably more ambitious - and significantly weirder - than any of the expeditions we've seen before. 
That said, Leviathan begins in much the same way as previous expeditions, dropping all players into one location. However, what follows is something closer to a roguelike experience, stripping explorers of their progress whenever they die. The narrative twist, though, is that players are actually stuck in a mysterious time loop, and the entire community will need to work together to find a way to break free.

Inspired by classic slasher films of the 1980s, it's a narrative-driven game that sees you escaping a house by solving puzzles, making dialogue decisions, and avoiding the killer.


That's an impossible feat at first, but repeated attempts at escape will put all the pieces together. And judging by the trailer below, its low-fi graphics only add to the horrifying atmosphere.

The footage may only be short, but it is absolutely gorgeous and packed with swelling music and sprawling, otherworldly, vistas.

Meanwhile, other titles such as the recently released Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection and WWE 2K22, only offer trials for two hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher School live-action role-play events in Poland, one of which I attended in 2016, have come to an end because of a contractual termination by CD Projekt Red over use of The Witcher name. The exact reasons why are potentially political but also unclear.
5 Żywiołów (5 Elements), the company behind the events, alleges that CD Projekt Red pulled the licence because of a staff member's involvement with the ultra-conservative Polish Catholic organisation Ordo Iuris, which is anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+, and rejects the idea of gender equality.
The staff member in question, Ania Wawrzyniak, is the wife of 5 Żywiołów founder Dastin Wawrzyniak. And according to a Facebook post co-signed by brothers Dastin and Dominic Wawrzyniak, Ania worked as a lawyer for the company for around two years (between 2017 and 2019, they later specified).

The Structured Logging Working

has added new capabilities to the logging infrastructure in Kubernetes
1.24. This blog post explains how developers can take advantage of those to
make log output more useful and how they can get involved with improving Kubernetes.
Structured logging
The goal of structured
logging
is to replace C-style formatting and the resulting opaque log strings with log
entries that have a well-defined syntax for storing message and parameters
separately, for example as a JSON struct.
When using the traditional klog text output format for structured log calls,
strings were originally printed with \n escape sequences, except when
embedded inside a struct. For structs, log entries could still span multiple
lines, with no clean way to spl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Temtem, developer Crema's massively multiplayer riff on Pokémon, will be leaving early access and getting its full PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 6th September.


Temtem, you might recall, entered Steam early access back in January 2020, selling over half a million copies in its first month of release. Crema has been steadily expanded the game's core creature-collecting and battling action since then - introducing the likes of new Temtem, new islands to explore, and new social and competitive features, not to mention launching an early access version for PS5 - and update 1.0 is now finally in sight.


After more than two years in early access, Temtem is already pretty feature rich, with its pre-release version including the bulk of its story campaign across the Airborne Archipelago, well over 100 Temtem to catch, co-op play, competitive multiplayer, clans, housing, trading, and tournaments. However, its final release promises a number of new additions.

Developer Maxis confirmed it was investigating ways to introduce expanded pronoun options to The Sims 4 last May - following a community petition signed by more than 22,000 people - and players got a first look at the feature's progress during a livestream earlier this year.


And now, with some additional development time under its belt, Maxis has pushed the first iteration of its customisable pronouns feature - developed in conjunction with LGBTQ+ nonprofit organisations It Gets Better and GLAAD - live, delivering what it calls a further step "in the direction of a more inclusive experience for Simmers".

Platforms have yet to be detailed.


Activision Blizzard formally revealed Modern Warfare 2 and its logo in April - after months of rumours and even an official pre-announcement announcement in February.


Following today's release date confirmation, specifics remain extremely light, but the gameplay-free trailer accompanying Activision Blizzard's announcement does include a description revealing a smidgeon more of what's in store.

DICE at least does have some previous in turning around a shaky ship - Battlefield 4 went from a disastrous launch to become one of the most celebrated in the series - and is making the right noises ahead of the belated launch of Battlefield 2042's first season next month. 


While we're not yet privy to the full reveal, a discussion between creative director Lars Gustavsson, senior producer Ryan McArthur and community manager Freeman outlined the studio's commitment to Battlefield 2042 - interesting itself in light of comments made by EA boss Andrew Wilson to investors earlier this month that suggested development on the series is being rethought - as well as what changes to expect.

It's a handy feature which was also added post-launch to Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Valhalla's predecessor, and no doubt will also encourage a few people to go splash out further on some of this game's flashier cosmetic armour sets. Here's how it looks:

One such find has recently surfaced, and it involves the final memory Link uncovers towards the game's close.
Those who have played through Breath of the Wild will know that Link slowly starts to regain his memories of the events before and during the Great Calamity as the game progresses (of course, this being Breath of the Wild, you could also blast through without collecting a single one of these memories if facing off against Ganon with the bare essentials is more your thing). 
The final memory can only be discovered when players have collected the 12 others scattered across Hyrule and cannot be happened upon by accident (which incidentally is how I found most of them - my geographical recognition was pretty poor during my first playthrough).

"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, based on the legendary The Lord of the Rings trilogy of books by JRR Tolkien, tells of Gollum's experiences from behind-the-scenes in the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring," writes  Daedalic. "After losing his precious ring to Bilbo Baggins, Gollum decides to leave the Misty Mountains and embark on a perilous journey that leads him from the dungeons of Barad-dûr to the realm of the Wood-elves in Mirkwood.   

"In order to survive the dangers of his journey through Middle-earth, Gollum has to sneak and climb and use all his cunning."  As part of a hands-off preview last week, I got to see some of this cunning in action.

Take-Two is the company behind some of video gaming's biggest names, such as Borderlands and Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, BioShock and Mafia.

Publisher Square Enix had originally planned each season to last three months, but now that's been doubled. "Based on the feedback we have received from our players, we feel that we need a period to re-evaluate the game's future operating roadmap", according to a blog post from last Friday.


"Season 2 will include the Ver. 1.2.1 small-scale update, but after that we will be using the extra three months of the season extension for development on the next update, and so will not be making any further updates or adding new content during that time.

Now, the duo are returning to the series in the aptly named Return to Monkey Island and in the run up to its release have revealed the one puzzle they regret from their original time working on the series. 
Chatting to GamesBeat, Gilbert and Grossman revealed the Monkey Wrench puzzle from LeChuck's Revenge, which saw Guybrush Threepwood using an actual monkey to activate a seemingly broken pump, was a mistake, calling it "notoriously unsolvable" and "not a good design on several levels". 
"Even if you are an English speaker from a location where the tool in question is commonly called a 'monkey wrench,' and you realise that that's what you need, you still have to make an astonishing predictive leap about how your actions will create that tool," said Grossman. "Nothing in the game sets any of it up adequately."

Welsh voice actor Arthur admits it too. "I know that he's caused quite a stir in the furry world, which I didn't know anything about until I looked on the internet," he says at the start.

The launch gives us our first proper look at the service's full catalogue of games - although fans say it contains far fewer titles in its catalogue than previously expected. 


Indeed, a guide to PlayStation Plus published yesterday on the PlayStation blog mentions "700" games available across the subscription's various plans - a rough figure we've heard from Sony before - albeit with the caveat that these games will vary "over time and plan".

The subscription has now launched in Asia, but - as spotted by VGC - some PS1 games are using the PAL (Europe, Australia, New Zealand) version instead of the NTSC (Asia, America).


That means they're presented in 50Hz instead of 60Hz, resulting in a lower refresh rate and therefore lower framerates.

Activision Blizzard contested the filing, but its arguments were rejected by NLRB, whereupon the publisher was reportedly began ramping up its anti-unionisation efforts.

When Sony Bend Studio shared word of Syphon Filter's new trophies last week, it didn't confirm whether other PS1 titles would be getting a similar treatment as part of Sony's revised PlayStation Plus - but with the service now going live, that question has been answered.


Achievement tracking website Exophase has revealed trophy lists for four more PS1 games alongside the previously announced Syphon Filter: I.Q. Intelligent Qube, Hot Shots Golf, Ape Escape, and Wild Arms (which, notably, wasn't on Sony's previous list of PS Plus inclusions).

The DioField Chronicle is a new tactics game coming to PS4 and PS5 later this year, as well as PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It was announced at PlayStation State of Play back in March.

"The Spotter Scope and its automatic features of marking and following enemies continued to show overly strong performance, causing more stress than enjoyable experiences to our players," Krafton explains. "Therefore, the enemy detection range has been reduced from 1000m to 600m and the white passive marker will not appear automatically in ADS mode."

As for the 1v1 Arena mode? That's now available in Training Mode and welcomes "all types of combat practice in a suspenseful 1v1 setting", as well as curious spectators, too.

Stellaris, a sort of space-faring amalgam of grand strategy and 4X action, burst onto the scene back in 2016 to significant acclaim. Six years on, it's a substantially different beast, with Paradox having made some sweeping changes along the way, most notably in its radical 2.0 release.

Redout 2, which was originally expected to launch on 26th May, builds on the superb racing action of its 2016 predecessor with a whole new set of tracks (36 in total, plus mirror variants of each) alongside expanded customisation options - with players now able to start with one of 12 distinct chassis and strap on the likes of new rocket engines, propulsors, stabilsers, rudders, magnets, intercoolers, flaps, wings, and spoilers.


There's also online multiplayer racing for up to 12 challengers, plus a single-player career campaign, promising "hundreds" of events from a variety of different modes, including Arena Races, Time Attacks, Last Man Standing, and Boss Races.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After one hell of a long wait, the live-action Halo TV adaptation finally arrived earlier this year, and the response has been...mixed. And now Marcus Lehto, co-creator of the videogame series that started all, has shared his own thoughts on the adaptation, saying that while he doesn't "hate" it, he was ultimately "confused by many of the choices that were made".


Paramount+'s Halo adaptation finally launched for US audiences this March - a mere nine years after it was originally announced - and while changes were expected (fans were forewarned that the TV show takes place in the so-called Silver Timeline, separate from the core Halo canon), the end result has certainly proven divisive.


While it was Master Chief's amusing loss of inhibitions that drew the most headlines over the series' run - just episodes after he'd stunned audiences by showing his face for the first time, he'd got his bum out, then ended the series having sex in front of his mum - there's been plenty of criticism around the show's writing, inconsistent tone, uneven plotting, and pacing.

allows Kubernetes to detect when a node is shutting down cleanly, and handles that situation appropriately.
A Node Shutdown can be "graceful" only if the node shutdown action can be detected by the kubelet ahead
of the actual shutdown. However, there are cases where…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves' sixth season of content might be well reaching its end point, but developer Rare still has a little something up is sleeve before Season 7 arrives, and it's now inviting clue hunters to get stuck into a new "multi-channel narrative experience" it's calling Mysteries.


Mysteries were originally discussed back in January, when Rare laid out its plans for Sea of Thieves in 2022. The big gambit this year, if you're unaware, is an ongoing, season-spanning narrative that will progress across monthly in-game story episodes known as Adventures.


It's a promising idea that so far doesn't really seem to have found its footing, with Seas of Thieves' initial set of Adventures having felt decidedly undercooked, both in terms of their challenges and narrative presentation. But with three Adventures now under its belt, Rare is ready to launch the other major component of 2022's ambitious narrative plans: Mysteries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced two new small-scale Kit expansions for The Sims 4 - one themed around evening fashion, the other around camping for kids - with both due to release on 26th May. Astute readers may note the word werewolf is yet to feature, despite previous teases from EA, but there's still some hope it seems...


The first of EA's newly announced expansions is the Moonlight Chic Kit, which appears to primarily focus its attention on new clothing options for your little digital pals, offering up new looks, designed by Parisian creator Paola Locatelli, said to be "perfect for all the experiences a Sim will encounter during a night out on the town".


Expect "slinky dresses, flowing shirts and smart jackets, all of which can be styled with sneakers for casual fun or dressed up with some silk and sparkles for a romantic date."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ben Brode, the charismatic former boss of Blizzard's card battler Hearthstone, has finally revealed his new project. It's called Marvel Snap, and is a new multiplayer collectible card game filled with comic book characters.

Brode quit Blizzard back in 2018, after more than 15 years at the company, and before its more recent troubles became public. Alongside others who had worked with him to launch Hearthstone, Brode went on to found his own studio, Second Dinner, which has been working on Marvel Snap ever since with Chinese outfit Nuverse, the gaming arm of TikTok owner Bytedance.


Snap's focus is on short, unique matches which "cut out the fluff" and last around three minutes total. Player decks are smaller - 15 cards or fewer - and both players act simultaneously, rather than waiting for the other person to finish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System of a Down singer Serj Tankian has joined the growing selection of artists contributing to upcoming music-themed first-person shooter Metal: Hellsinger.


Metal: Hellsinger, which was revealed back in June 2020, is the work of developer The Outsiders - the studio co-founded by former Battlefield 3 lead designer and Payday 2 director David Goldfarb - and promises to developer plenty of furious gun-based demon-slaying, all synced up to a metal soundtrack.


Each of the game's stages will feature its own track, with the player's power increasing - alongside the complexity of the music, from atmospheric background ambience all the way up to big metal anthems - if they manage to keep their attacks timed to the beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we're talking PlayStation Plus Premium, and our thoughts on whether it's worth the price based on what we know so far. 

The thing is, there are still several questions about what it will provide - even now, less than a week away from its initial rollout in Asia. What is its full game list? How good will its streaming be? And how soon should we expect newer games like Ratchet & Clank and Horizon Forbidden West to turn up on the service? 
The biggest difference between PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass is, of course, the lack of big new first-party games launching into Plus on day one. But, with Starfield's delay to 2023, Microsoft might not have any on Game Pass this year either. How will Xbox counter? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

Arizona man Nathan Harris is trying to launch the suit, which claims Hearthstone tricks players into non-refundable purchases without knowing the odds of rare cards (thanks, Polygon). 


In particular, Harris complains that his daughter - who used his credit card without asking - did not realise you could not get a refund from packs which "almost never received any valuable cards". The game also lacks parental controls, Harris complained.

"As a business leader it's exceptionally difficult to navigate highly politicised issues like transgender and abortion rights. But I'm not content to sit back and say or do nothing," he tweeted, before sharing an in-depth message he had sent out to his employees.
This message reads: "It is appalling that states, including the [Certain Affinity] headquarters' home state of Texas, are wading into what I consider personal health and privacy matters. Recently this encompassed gross intrusions on the rights and dignity of transgender youth, putting politics over the physical and emotional health and wellbeing of a vulnerable population, and threatening their families, friends, doctors and other supporters.

It follows on from the likes of Spider Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, and The Last of Us Part Two in having an extensive suite of options.


"Not only have we redesigned our UI to allow for more flexibility and readability, but we have also rebuilt controller remapping from the ground up and added more customization to our combat and interaction systems. We have retained all our accessibility features from 2018's God of War and expanded upon them to include more than 60 ways to adjust gameplay to best suit your style and needs," reads a PlayStation Blog on the topic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can now watch the first episode of the Pokémon: Hisuian Snow anime series on YouTube or through Pokémon TV.
The show's debut episode, which is called "Onto the Icy Blue", introduces us to a boy named Alec. During his youth, Alec was led to believe that Pokémon and people could not live peacefully together. This is due to the Pokémon's powers, which the humans fear. However, when an older and wiser Alec goes to visit his father the Hisui region (of Arceus fame), he starts to look back on his childhood and recalls an encounter with a wild and (characteristically) timid Zorua. 
It is a short but adorable watch, and perfect to enjoy with a nice cup of tea. So, that's your cue. Pop the kettle on, then come back and settle on in with the first episode, which can be watched below.

Oh, and you know The Stranger (wink wink) we all meet at the beginning of the game - well, thanks to this mod, he becomes the Hi-diddly-hoing Ned Flanders.
The mod comes from Omega Fantasy (via IGN) and uses the character models from 2003's The Simpson's Hit and Run. And to be honest, if all this mod did was swap out God of War's characters for those from Hit and Run, it would have still been an incredibly amusing watch.

"On Saturday, 14th May, a young white man drove hours from his home to a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, and opened fire in a crowded supermarket, killing ten people and maiming three others," Bungie said in a statement. "It has since been confirmed that this was an act of terror aimed at Black Americans and is being investigated as a hate crime. Our hearts go out to the victims of this tragedy, and anyone impacted by this act of violence."


The studio, in collaboration with its Black at Bungie inclusion club, has announced a number of initiatives in response to the attack. It will, for instance, donate all profits made through the sale of its Be Heard collectable pin over the next 12 months to the Southern Poverty Law Center - a charity whose work includes "monitoring hate groups and other extremists throughout the United States and exposing their activities to the public, the media, and law enforcement."

Phonopolis, which makes use of actual corrugated cardboard sets and a 12fps stop-motion animation style inspired by classic animated films, casts players as Felix, a thoughtful young man who must try and stop the titular city's authoritarian leader from playing the Absolute tone - an occurrence that would effectively cause Felix and his fellow citizens to lose their humanity.
What follows is a story-driven puzzle adventure encompassing "relatable, real-world themes", including manipulation and individualism. That doesn't mean it'll be heavy going, though; Amanita says Phonopolis will explore its subject matter in a "playful and light-hearted" way.

Word of a PlayStation 5 remake for The Last of Us first surfaced in April 2021 when Bloomberg reported the project had initially been in the works at Sony's San Diego-based Visual Arts Service Group before Naughty Dog was asked to take over. Further evidence of the project's existence emerged earlier this year, when a member of Naughty Dog's QA team listed an "unannounced remake" on their resumé - a reference since removed.


Yet while there's still no official word on a Last of Us remake, rumours of the project continue to swirl, with ever-leaky GamesBeat reporter Jeff Grubb now claiming it's set for a 2022 release.

Headhunter - a "stylised and colourful, third-person co-op action adventure" that was announced last November - initially looked like it would be the sixth entry in the celebrated series, following on from SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Heist, SteamWorld Dig 2, and SteamWorld Quest. That may no longer be the case, however.


According to Thunderful's latest earnings report (thanks IGN), Headhunter, which is now scheduled for a 2023 release, won't be the only SteamWorld title coming that year. An accompany release schedule reveals that Thunderful has three additional, currently unannounced SteamWorld games in development, with two of those also due in 2023.

Roller Champions, if you're unfamiliar, is Ubisoft's stab at creating the kind of knockabout sports mash-up that's made Rocket League such a perennial favourite, playing out like a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football - wherein two teams of three hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another and score a goal.


Is it any good? Time will tell, but Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was pretty impressed when he played an early version shortly after its E3 2019 unveiling, calling it "honestly one of the demos I found hardest to tear myself away from."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Spiders' scrappy but enjoyable RPG GreedFall is getting a sequel, and it'll be launching for PC and unspecified consoles in 2024. Or next year - publisher Nacon's press release and YouTube description currently disagree, which I'm trying to get to the bottom of.


When the original GreedFall launched in 2019, its combination of RPG action and BioWare-style player choice struck a bit of a chord despite its unavoidable rough edges, quickly raising its profile through plenty of positive word of mouth - ultimately, to the tune of over 2m sales - as players got stuck into its ambitious historical fantasy yarn.


"GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults," said Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfield in her review at the time, "and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced plans to accelerate the company's Road to Zero initiative, its plan to achieve carbon neutrality throughout its entire "value chain", by 10 years.
The Road to Zero plan was first concieved in 2010, when Sony announced it as a "a long-term global environmental plan... to realise a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of Sony's products and business activities". Originally, this target of carbon neutrality was set for 2050. However, today the company released a statement revealing a new target year of 2040.
"Sony will accelerate its target year for carbon neutrality, that is, greenhouse gas emissions of virtually zero, from 2050 to 2040. Specifically, Sony intends to make direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) of its own operations carbon neutral by 2030, and by 2040, in addition to scopes 1 and 2, Sony will also target other emissions originating from stages such as products, supply chains, and logistics (scope 3), aiming for net zero emissions achieved in all scopes."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I got to have a closer look at the Saints Row reboot from Volition. As you would expect, it looked bombastic and eclectic, with a myriad of unusual ideas that can only really be married together in a Saints Row game.
However, at this point, it also felt like Volition has focused a bit too much on adding in all this "stuff" to the game, and seemingly at the cost of some polish and finesse. Saints Row was confirmed to be a cross-gen release on its initial announcement last year, and that seems to be a fair market for it. Right now, it just looks and feels like more of a last-gen game than a current one.
Throughout the showcase, Saints Row's fighting appeared to be a touch clunky, while its cutscenes and dialogue felt more forced than we may expect from a game today. Meanwhile, during a close up of the Boss' face, you could clearly see that the character's eyelashes and eyelids did not match up in the way you would expect them to. This could be a bug that will be fixed by launch, but it was nonetheless jarring on the eye (mine, not the Boss', although their eye did look jarred as well).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following my hands off preview of the Saints Row reboot, I sat down and chatted more with Volition developers Kenzie Lindgren (associate UX designer) and Damien Allen (principal designer). We covered a broad range of topics, including plenty on what's new for this entry, but we started by discussing why Saints Row aficionados should come back to the series, despite its brand-new cast and setting. 


"It definitely still feels like Saints Row - even if it's not the same characters, even if it's not the same setting, even if it's not exactly the same as before - it feels like Saints Row," Lindgren said.


"I feel that every single time I go into the game, whether that's just customisation (because customisation is a huge part of it), whether that's travelling around the city, whether that's wing suiting and doing the missions, it feels like Saints Row. And I think that's at least worth checking out if you're an older player, but also for a newer player to discover that feeling for the first time."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has finally fixed a performance issue with Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, two months after its release.


As reported back in March, hair and fur textures were tanking the frame rate when played on PC - sometimes as low as 8FPS. Modders have released fixes which make all characters bald in a bid to alleviate the issue.



Now an update has been released for the game, in which "models for hair and fur associated with important characters have been revised to improve performance."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solo developer Stephen Ddungu believes Disney and Marvel likely copied his indie game for an eye-catching fight sequence in the recent Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.


Ddungu has been chronicling his work on music-based JRPG Sword of Symphony via Tiktok, where footage of the game's combat system has notched up millions of views (thanks, Kotaku). 


His game allows you to conjur glowing musical notes in mid-air and send them flinging towards an enemy. If you've seen the new Doctor Strange, you'll likely recognise that description - since a short sequence in the film sees Benedict Cumberbatch doing just that.

In the video, presenters of the tool embarrassingly apply their findings to Nintendo's series.


Apparently the game lacks diversity in ability and sexual orientation, as the characters aren't disabled and are all presumed straight. How you can tell someone's sexual orientation just by looking at them is beyond me.

Kubernetes v1.24 introduces a new alpha-level feature that prevents unauthorised users

The problem
The Volume Mode determines whether a volume
is formatted into a filesystem or presented as a raw block device.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Elden Ring on Game Boy to that Advance Wars/Mass Effect mash-up, demakes are all the rage these days - and now it's classic first-person puzzler Portal's turn to get the retro port treatment, courtesy of a new fan project to rebuild it for N64.


Portal, of course, released back in 2007 as part of Valve's legendary Orange Box collection, where it immediately wrought cake memes, Companion Cubes and iconic antagonist GLaDOS upon an unsuspecting world. It also proved to be an ingenious puzzler beneath all that - tasking players with manipulating portals to navigate increasingly devious challenges - and one that still holds up wonderfully today.


The currently in-development Portal demake, officially known as Portal 64, is the work of developer James Lambert, and is ambitiously attempting to pack the entire experience of Valve's classic - memes, portals, puzzles, and all - down onto Nintendo hardware that preceded its release by over a decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following recent reports that Sony is refusing to approve any statements from PlayStation studios relating to reproductive rights, Bungie - whose acquisition by Sony was announced in February - has said "there will never be a 'muzzle' big enough to stop us from standing up for what's right".
Bungie was one of the first studios to speak out in support of Roe v Wade, a key judgement which legalised abortion across the US, following recent reports the US Supreme Court was trying to overturn the ruling. At the time, the developer called the move a "direct attack on human rights", adding that "standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values".
However, in light of reports that Sony is refusing to authorise any public statements its PlayStation studios might want to make around the issue of reproductive rights, some Bungie fans have questioned whether the developer will still be able to express its opinion so freely once its acquisition by Sony is complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer The Bearded Ladies, the studio behind 2018's acclaimed turn-based strategy adventure Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, has unveiled Miasma Chronicles - a new tactical RPG that's heading to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 some time next year.


Miasma Chronicles unfolds in a United States torn apart by a force known only as the Miasma, some time in the "not-too-distant future". Here, in the mining town of Sedentary, we meet our protagonist Elvis, a young man raised by a robotic older "brother" after being left by his mother. 


Elvis, for reasons both unknown and extremely convenient as far as gameplay goes, has access to a mysterious glove that enables him to control Miasma - a device that'll almost certainly prove useful as the brothers set out across the post-apocalyptic wasteland in search of answers that might "change the course of human history forever."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Bohemia Interactive has, following an extensive leak over the weekend, officially unveiled Arma Reforger, the next step in its long-running first-person military shooter series. Described as the "first milestone on the long road to Arma 4", Reforger launches into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access today.


Bohemia opened a lengthy livestream earlier today with confirmation that the long-awaited Arma 4 is in development (its predecessor, Arma 3, celebrates its 10th birthday next year), but the remainder of the stream's focus was very much on Reforger. It's being called a new standalone "platform" for the series, consisting of several key parts; there's a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.


Reforger's sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia's previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer's latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.

While not yet confirmed by developer Epic Games, eagle-eyed Fortnite leakers are confident this season will end in another of the game's eye-catching live events - the first of 2022 - likely on Saturday, 4th June.


This afternoon, Epic itself issued a typically cryptic teaser with snippets of audio and an unmistakable logo at the end: the fan-favourite Mech (or Mecha Team Leader, to give its full name) which duelled and ultimately beat Fortnite's Devourer monster in one of the game's most memorable moments back in 2019.

Developer Frontier last year admitted the game had under-performed, something it blamed on the delay of the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion movie, now due in June. Here's hoping Xbox Game Pass gives it fresh legs.

In a blog post acknowledging the continued issue and the ongoing "frustration within the community" it said it had felt too, Amazon announced it had permanently banned "several million accounts that participated in botting, hacking or gold-selling".


"Since Lost Ark launched, we've been fighting a war against the bots infiltrating Arkesia," Amazon dramatically wrote. "Addressing bots can be especially challenging in free-to-play games because it's so easy to create an account and enter the game, but we're working on multiple fronts to fight them."

"Rockstar Games talks about the updates that are coming, and we're working on an awful lot at Rockstar Games," Zelnick said. "I've heard the frustration, it's flattering that they want more content, and more will be said by Rockstar in due time."

The new sales milestone was announced today via the official Final Fantasy 15 Twitter account.


While a sizable number, it's interesting to compare it to the 11.8m copies sold by the Square Enix-published Rise of the Tomb Raider, launched back in 2015, or the 14.5m copies sold by the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot - especially in light of Square Enix ditching its western game studios, such as Tomb Raider's Crystal Dynamics.

As a result of the sale, Scavengers' console versions - currently being tested via a closed alpha - have been cancelled, Eurogamer has been told. Its PC version currently remains alive, as a small internal team keeps it operational.

Multiversus was officially unveiled last November following a string of leaks, and now, after and a steady stream of reveals focused on its increasingly proposterous character roster - where the likes of Game of Thrones' Arya Stark can battle against Scooby Doo's Shaggy - it finally enters invite-only closed alpha later this week.


Multiversus' closed alpha runs from 19th-27th May, giving participants access to 15 playable fighters, seven maps, and a selection of different modes.

Kerbal Space Program 2 was first confirmed to be in development during Gamescom 2019, where it slapped with what would prove to be an extremely optimistic 2020 release date. Publisher Private Division later adjusted that to "fiscal 2021" - sometime between April 2020 and March 2021 - and then pushed it back once again to autumn 2021.


That still wasn't the end of the delays, however; as 2020 drew to a close, developer Intercept Games revealed it had made the decision to postpone release yet again, this time to some nebulous point in 2022, citing the "immense technical and creative challenge" of developing the sequel. And now, Kerbal Space Program 2's release has shifted once more.

At the time of its announcement, CD Projekt said the series would follows the adventures of a street kid trying to survive in a technology- and body-modification-obsessed city of the future. "Having everything to lose," went the official blurb, "he chooses to stay alive by becoming an edgerunner — a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk."

According to a new report by The Washington Post, Spider-Man and Ratchet & Clank developer Insomniac, which was acquired by Sony in 2020, had made the decision to donate $50,000 USD to the Women's Reproductive Rights Assistance Project (WRRAP) following the US Supreme Court's recent proposal to reverse Roe v Wade, a key judgement which legalised abortion across the country - a donation Sony has agreed to match, along with any additional donations from staff, as part of company's "PlayStation Cares" programme.


However, according to the Washington Post, Sony won't authorise any public statement Insomniac might want to make about reproductive rights or its donation, and staff have been expressly forbidden from mentioning either Sony or Insomniac in any retweet should the WRRAP choose to make an announcement about the donation. "[Sony Interactive Entertainment] will not approve ANY statements from any studio on the topic of reproductive rights," Insomniac head Ted Price told studio employees in an email dated 13th May. "We fought hard for this and we did not win.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knockout battle royale game Fall Guys is going free-to-play from 21st June, developer Mediatonic has announced. Additionally, the shift in monetisation model will coincide with the game's long-awaited release on Switch and Xbox, as well as the arrival of a new PlayStation 5 version, and its debut on the Epic Games Store.


As part of its transition to free-to-play, Fall Guys - which celebrates its second birthday later this year - will be hitting the reset button, and 21st June will see it re-launching with a new season that Mediatonic is referring to as Season 1: Free For All, promising "stacks of new challenges and rewards".


As with Rocket League before it, which similarly went free-to-play after being snapped up by Epic Games, Fall Guys will be adapting a monetisation model that'll be immediately familiar to Fortnite players. That means the arrival of a new paid premium Season Pass - purchasable with a new in-game currency known as Show-Bucks - that'll sit alongside the existing free tier.

As spotted by notorious Microsoft leaker Aggiornamenti Lumia and Windows Central, the in-progress app looks like it will let you add up to eight concurrent visual effects to custom imagery. You can then layer said effects over a timeline, creating an animated background for your PC or console.


Microsoft took a little while to add dynamic backgrounds to Xbox, but there are now an array to choose from, including themes which nod back to the Xbox console family's past, as well as to favourite franchises such as Halo.

"Alan Wake 2 is in the full production stage," Remedy wrote in its latest financial results. "A lot of work remains, but the game is starting to take a more complete form in many areas. As communicated earlier, Alan Wake 2 will be released in 2023."

A blog post about the tool was shared on 12th May, but has since been heavily edited. Originally it mentioned the Overwatch 2 team was experimenting with the tool, but this has since been removed.

The volume populators feature is now two releases old and entering beta! The AnyVolumeDataSouce feature
gate defaults to enabled in Kubernetes v1.24, which means that users can specify any custom resource
as the data source of a PVC.
An earlier blog article detailed how the
volume populators feature works. In short, a cluster administrator can install a CRD and
associated populator controller in the cluster, and any user who can create instances of
the CR can create pre-populated volumes by taking advantage of the populator.
Multiple populators can be installed side by side for different purposes. The SIG storage

Forced to match the local prices on the Epic Games Stores across the world - regardless of each country's own economy or the fact the game has already launched - Sony's prices have absolutely rocketed for some, with places like Brazil seeing a price hike of 276 per cent (thanks, TechRaptor).

In the UK, players will actually see a saving - the price here has dropped from £16 to £13 - and in Canada, it's jumped a little from $22CAD to $27CAD.

Producer and director, Naoki Yoshida, confirmed that, while "extensive and persistent", the errors will  be resolved when the game goes into maintenance mode tomorrow, 16th May. 

It's taken a full month to fix the issue, though. Back in April, Yoshida apologised to players for ongoing issues with the MMORPG's new housing lottery system that prevented players from winning any land. Writing on the official website, he explain what the team was doing to address a problem in which players were being told their bids were unsuccessful because there "were no participants in this lottery", or that the winning number was "0"... even though no players can be assigned that number.

Earlier today, however, an alleged marketing and brand guide leaked online, revealing that a new multi-platform instalment, Arma Reforger, is on the way to PC. It looks like it's set to come to Xbox and PlayStation consoles, too, although the wording is a tad confusing, so it's possible the PS4 and PS5 release will come "in the future".

The leak intimates that the company is set to announce Arma 4 alongside Reforger, which has been called a "more focused" title that will "introduce Arma to a new console-oriented audience" with a "very strong multiplayer focus" that will "test new technology and design decisions to form the foundation for Arma 4."

The news came as part of the company's recent financial presentation, which revealed that one of Square Enix's "medium-term business strategy" initiatives is to "boost game development capabilities by establishing new studios, [mergers and acquisitions], etc."

As spotted by Axios' Stephen Totilo (thanks, NME), the company also revealed that the "objectives behind divestiture of select overseas studios and IP" - that is, the reason why it sold off its three western studios - was to "achieve sustained growth through selection and concentration of company sources, better align overseas publishing function with organisation in Tokyo, and transform group business portfolio".

In an interview with VentureBeat, Fils-Aimé confirmed that a developer rarely "makes a conscious decision not to continue supporting" a franchise, stating that - "at least during [his] tenure" - Nintendo is always experimenting with ways to make new games… or apply new ideas to an existing franchise. 

"Why was F-Zero abandoned?" he said. "The insight I would share is that, at least during my tenure, Nintendo developers were always experimenting with different gameplay styles, always thinking about where a unique experience could be applied back, either to an existing franchise or maybe creating a new franchise.

California was, of course, one of two states included at American Truck Simulator's launch back in 2016 (the other being Nevada), and has been starting to show in age in recent times, particularly alongside SCS' increasingly impressive work on newer state expansions.


As such, the developer pledged a refresh for the ageing location back in 2020, with the aim of bringing it up to current mapping standards. The first phase of this rework arrived last July, making significant changes to California's northern road network, adding (and in a few cases, removing) scenery towns, and introducing Border Protection Stations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If this week's two previously announced Epic Games Store freebies somehow aren't enough to be getting on with, Epic has also, rather unexpectedly, thrown in a third offering - taking the form of developer 34BigThings' blisteringly fast, wonderfully stylish anti-grav racer Redout.


Redout initially launched all the way back in 2016, immediately dazzling with its gorgeous, high-speed racing, and did well enough that it was followed up by no less than five expansions, introducing a host of new courses to sate those smitten with its core action.


The free Epic Store version doesn't include all those post-launch goodies, but it does deliver 11 event types across 25 tracks and five locations, alongside a robust career mode, extensive customisation, and online multiplayer for up to 12 racers. Which, to be honest, should be more than enough to keep you amused if this is your first time in Redout's world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game grading company Wata Games is the target of a new US class action lawsuit accusing it of unfair business practices and of manipulating the retro gaming market for its own gain.


As reported by VGC, the lawsuit was filed on 10th May in the Central District of California, representing class members (estimated to be as many as 10,000 individuals) who all paid for game grading and other services by Wata. It accuses Wata of "engaging in affirmative acts to manipulate the retro video game market" and of "engaging in unfair business practices", specifically pointing the figure at Wata president and CEO Deniz Kahn.

Kahn is accused of working with auction house Heritage Auctions co-founder Jim Halperin - a previous Wata investor and advisory board member - to manipulate the retro games market through promotional efforts and media interviews, in which the pair are said to have claimed that retro games prices would continue to rise.

Speaking to Fast Company, Epic boss Tim Sweeney said the release would allow "the full capabilities that you've seen [in Unreal Engine] opened up so that anybody can build very high-quality game content and code... and deploy it into Fortnite without having to do a deal with us - it's open to everybody".


Fortnite already has a Creative mode where you can build your own Fortnite island or mini-game using Epic-designed props and game design options. But collaborations with brands and monetisation of content has remained controlled by Epic itself.

The programme will once again run for two months this summer, with applications now open, exclusively to those from ethnic minorities who live in the UK. 


As we wrote last year when launching the scheme initially, the games media has a diversity problem and Eurogamer is no exception. It is on us to help affect change and continue improving representation, so that the games media better reflects the gaming community as a whole.

Starship Troopers: Terran Command is a traditional-looking real-time strategy game set in the Starship Troopers universe. As you'd expect, you take command of the mobile infantry and go to war against the Arachnid threat.


The video below shows how this plays out in the game - you generate troops, troops and more troops, who gain experience and battlefield prowess as they eradicate the enemy. The trick is keeping experienced troops alive long enough to get truly powerful. Once the last soldier in a squad is killed, that squad is toast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Slitherine has shown off half an hour of upcoming real-time tactics game Stargate: Timekeepers, while confirming plans to release a beta to coincide with the much-loved SG1 TV series' 25th anniversary in July.


The video, below, shows the Stargate: Timekeepers segment of Slitherine's Home of Wargamers event. It debuts the In Plain Site mission, in which the Stargate team, including sniper Max Bolton and technical officer Sam Watson, attempt to put down a sacrifice ritual inside the Jaffa village by disguising themselves as the enemy.


The stealth heavy Stargate: Timekeepers, developed by Creative Forge Games (Hard West, Phantom Doctrine), looks heavily inspired by the Commandos series (this is not a guns blazing type of game). The campaign departs from the end of season seven of the Stargate SG-1 main plot with an original story starting during the Battle of Antarctica. It unfolds over 14 missions, each of which lasts around an hour, and revolves around unravelling a timeloop mystery and defeating the Goa'uld threat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funcom has released some art for its next-gen multiplayer open-world survival Dune game.


In a call for staff applications to various open roles on the project, Funcom released two pieces of artwork that give us our first sense of the vibe this new Dune game is going for.

There's also an additional piece of art, showing a man, maker hook in hand, presumably about to pounce upon a sand worm.

With Kubernetes 1.24 the gRPC probes functionality entered beta and is available by default.
Now you can configure startup, liveness, and readiness probes for your gRPC app
without exposing any HTTP endpoint, nor do you need an executable. Kubernetes can natively connect to your your workload via gRPC and query its status.
Some history
It's useful to let the system managing your workload check that the app is
healthy, has started OK, and whether the app considers itself good to accept
traffic. Before the gRPC support was added, Kubernetes already allowed you to
check for health based on running an executable from inside the container image,
by making an HTTP request, or by checking whether a TCP connection succeeded.
For most apps, those checks are enough.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 2018, developer Remedy Entertainment announced it was working to adapt its beloved supernatural horror adventure Alan Wake for television - and now, some four years later, it finally has an update on the project, announcing it's partnering with The Walking Dead network AMC to bring the show to life.


Alan Wake, for the uninitiated, debuted on Xbox 360 back in 2010, and its small-town horror, in which the titular novelist battles supernatural forces armed with little more than a flashlight and an endless urge to monologue, quickly gained cult classic status. But while all was quiet on the Alan front for over a decade, he's had something of a resurgence in recent times.


Alongside a prominent role in Remedy's acclaimed Control - specifically in its second DLC, known as AWE - Alan Wake was given the remaster treatment in 2021 (a release now confirmed for Switch) and will be getting a long-awaited sequel some time next year. As such, a TV series expanding Alan's reach still further seems like the next logical step for Remedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been pining for the return of Ubisoft's impressively enduring Rabbids ahead of their flagship appearance in this year's Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope on Switch, you're in luck: Ubisoft has announced it'll be giving its previously China-exclusive game Rabbids: Adventure Party a global release at some point before the end of next month.


Rabbids: Adventure Party initially launched for Switch in 2020, sending the titular nuisances back in time for some hijinks inspired by classic Chinese novel Journey to the West - and for some minigame action played using the Switch's Joy-Con controllers.


There'll be a number of notable changes for Rabbids: Adventure Party come its global release, however. For starters, according to Ubisoft's latest earnings report, it'll be getting a new name, becoming the slightly less catchy Rabbids: Party of Legends, and will be branching out onto other platforms in addition to Switch - namely Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Stadia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space fans eager to get their hands on EA Motive's promising remake of developer Visceral Games' much-loved sci-fi horror classic now have a date to scrawl in their diaries; EA has confirmed it'll be releasing for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 27th January next year.


Announced last July, the Dead Space remake is a ground-up reworking of the 2008 original, promising to raise "the level of horror and immersion to unprecedented heights". Of course, players still step into the shoes of engineer Isaac Clarke as they take their terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura - battling the nightmarish necromorphs along the way - but EA Motive's version promises to bring enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks include improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Following the remake's official unveiling, EA Motive has given Dead Space fans a surprisingly thorough behind-the-scenes look at its development, revealing more on its gameplay changes, audio, and art across three separate livestreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake Remastered, the spruced-up version of developer Remedy's cult-classic action-horror, is officially launching on Switch this autumn. Additionally, the developer has offered an update on its long-awaited Alan Wake 2, saying it has made the decision to delay the larger reveal it had originally told fans to expect this summer.


Alan Wake Remastered - which bundles together the base game plus its two expansions, The Signal and The Writer - launched for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last October, giving Remedy's much-loved original a welcome modern-day makeover with the likes of richer environmental detail and enhanced character models.


A Switch version of Alan Wake Remastered wasn't previously been announced by Remedy, but a surprise listing pointing to a release on Nintendo's platform was spotted on the Brazilian ratings board website last September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're talking FIFA - or from next year, EA Sports FC. The breakup of FIFA and EA has sparked numerous headlines this week, as both sides have claimed the deal is good for them.

On EA's part, it has said freedom from the FIFA organisation will allow it to do far more with its football game.  (It will also, of course, save the hefty sum it paid for those four letters on the front of its box.) As for FIFA, it has said its brand is the thing that matters, and it'll be fine without EA. Indeed, to quote FIFA president Gianni Infantino, "the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST". So there's that.
But behind all the bluster, what do we think EA Sports FC will really look like in future? And does FIFA stand any chance of coming up with a rival game developed in time for next year? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan, plus resident footy fan Wesley Yin-Poole.

The lawsuit, which was filed by Riot's parent company Tencent, reads: "This action seeks to stop Moonton from continuing its deliberate and sustained campaign to free ride on Riot's highly valuable rights in the mobile video game League of Legends: Wild Rift and related content." The company goes on to call Moonton's strategy "blatant copying".
The lawsuit continues, "Over the years, as Riot updated its video game, Moonton would copy it. When Riot updated the game's promotional materials, Moonton copied them. And when Riot released a new trailer, Moonton copied it. This is a critical issue for Riot.

Keywords workers have now been told they can continue to work from home "until further notice", The Verge reported.

New data released by Ubisoft last night as part of its annual financial results revealed Valhalla had more unique players in the past 12 months ending 31st March 2022 than it did in the four months after its hugely-successful launch. 


The stat suggests players are still picking up - and sticking with - Valhalla. Indeed, Ubisoft also said that the past year - free from a new Assassin's Creed release - notched up nearly double the money than the year after 2018's Odyssey arrived. That points to stronger sales of Valhalla's DLC than Odyssey's, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a report last month that Ubisoft had attracted early takeover interest from several private equity firms, the Assassin's Creed publisher has once again addressed the issue, saying it has "everything we need to remain independent."


Ubisoft initially discussed the subject of buyouts back in February, following a round of acquisitions that saw Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, Sony buying Bungie, and Take-Two buying Zynga. Since then, however, a report from Bloomberg claimed Ubisoft had attracted preliminary interest from a number of private equity firms, although it was said the publisher had yet to enter into "serious negotiations" regarding such a deal.


In light of those reports, Ubisoft has once again addressed the subject of acquisitions, albeit in very much the same terms it did back in February. "There've been a lot of talks around consolidation in the industry, and in Ubisoft in particular," company chairman Yves Guillemont said during the publisher's latest earnings call, adding that its "overall position is clear."

Ubisoft's pirate ship battler - a spin-off from 2013 Assassin's Creed game Black Flag - has been repeatedly delayed, though test footage leaked late last month suggested a launch was now finally on the horizon. Today, Ubisoft reconfirmed it would indeed see the light of day this financial year (before 1st April 2023). 


Also up this year, finally, is Ubisoft's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Developed by The Division studio Massive Entertainment, it was first announced more than five years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember last week when we reported on the video showing one The Last of Us Part 2 fan trying to rewrite the game's narrative using mods? Well, they have done it again, and this time discovered the zebra that Abby and her father take care of in Salt Lake City is actually invincible (for which I am quite relieved - this game has enough bloodshed as it is).
In the second episode of Speclizer's myth busting series, the creator used a series of gunshots and explosives to see if the zebra would meet its demise. However, that lady is a hardy one, and if anything, she only looks mildly disgruntled as the bomb blasts go off around her (which, you know, seems fair).
Another amusing discovery comes from the snowy streets of Jackson. This time, it is Ellie in the control seat, and she is pissed at the community's annoying kids for trying to best her in a snowball fight. However, no matter how far Ellie goes from that play area, she will still be hit over and over again by the white stuff. In the words of Speclizer, "the kids have aimbot".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It wasn't long ago that developer Respawn Entertainment's confirmed its free-to-play battle royale shooter Apex Legends would finally be making its debut on mobile devices this May - and now the developer has gone one better, confirming it'll be heading to iOS and Android next Tuesday, 17th May.


Apex Legends' move to mobile was made official last April, when Respawn confirmed it would be a completely separate entity to its console and PC counterparts, meaning players should expect unique battle passes, even mobile-only maps and gameplay - although no cross-play. It also promises to tailor the experience specifically for mobile devices with the likes of streamlined controls for touchscreens.


Apex Legends Mobile has been available to select players for some time now, having entered regional testing earlier this year, but Respawn has now confirmed its ready to roll out the experience globally, with its full iOS and Android launch now set for next Tuesday, 17th May.

As you might have already twigged, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club's celebrated underground railway builder Mini Metro, and delivers an equally minimalist, equally excellent, spin on its predecessor's tactile strategy action.


In Mini Motorways, each level takes loose inspiration from a real-world city, and the goal is to construct as efficient a road network as possible, placing down the likes of traffic lights, bridges, and roads to ensure commuters are able to reach their destination within the allotted time. New building items are awarded each in-game week, enabling your urban expansion to continue unfettered - until you make a mistake and your best laid plans end in chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Georgetown has a <a href="https://americandragnet.org/">new report</a> on the highly secretive bulk surveillance activities of ICE in the US:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you think about government surveillance in the United States, you likely think of the National Security Agency or the FBI. You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don&#8217;t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE&#8217;s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government&#8217;s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has &#8212; without any judicial, legislative or public oversight &#8212; reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver&#8217;s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Speaking to The New York Times, EA boss Andrew Wilson said a lot of the company's motivation was to improve players' experiences without being pigeonholed.
"It was really about how can we do more for the players, more for the fans, how can we offer them more modalities to play," he said. "How can we bring more partners into the game, how can we expand beyond the bounds of the traditional game."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioWare has swiftly shut down internet speculation it had inadvertantly teased a return for franchise hero Commander Shepard in the next Mass Effect.


Yesterday, fan gossip was sparked by the description of a poster on the BioWare store. The poster is a print of the teaser image BioWare released last November for its in-development Mass Effect game, and was described thus: "While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what's next."


This description (which was later corrected to remove Shepard's name) was enough to spark YouTube videos, as well as articles from various blogs and websites. And, of course, the fire was only fuelled further by BioWare's later correction.

The company released its financial report earlier today and announced its "fifth consecutive year of record-high profits", although this is actually its ninth consecutive year of seeing some kind of profit growth. Capcom stated these profits have been driven by its digital contents business (so, hey there Resident Evil and Monster Hunter).
"Net sales were 110bn yen (up 15.5 percent from the previous fiscal year), operating income was 42bn yen (up 24 percent), ordinary income was 44bn yen (up 27.2 percent), and net income attributable to owners of the parent was 32,553m yen (up 30.6 percent)," Capcom said.

The other three mystery titles include a "remake", a "sports title, and a "partner title" - likely meaning one of the various studios EA publishes games for, such as It Takes Two's Hazelight.


Alongside those, EA also has its upcoming (and final) FIFA game and Madden NFL 23 set for this autumn, before NHL 23 and the long-awaited Need for Speed turn up before Christmas. So, what could those mystery games be?

"I will refrain from making comments on the competitors' strategy," PlayStation exec Hiroki Totoki told investors during the company's latest financial call). "Our current thinking is to have development costs [and] appropriate R&D investment for quality products, and that will improve the platform and also improve the business in the long run.
"AAA type titles on PS5, if we distribute that on the subscription services, we may need to shrink the investment needed for that and that will deteriorate the first-party title quality and that is our concern."

Speaking to investors last night, EA boss Andrew Wilson said the publisher was taking "the long view" when it came to the franchise, and that it would remain a big part of EA for the forseeable future.


Wilson praised former Respawn boss Vince Zampella in his new expanded role in which he also oversees some Battlefield development, and also promised EA would continue to "grow" Battlefield 2042 - after righting its ship first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following EA's announcement that it will be ditching the FIFA brand and renaming its long-running football series EA Sports FC starting in 2023, FIFA President Gianni Infantino has responded, insisting, "the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans."


That comes alongside FIFA's announcement it'll be adopting a non-exclusive licensing model for games based on its brand moving forward, and that it's currently working with third-party studios and publishers to developer new projects. This, it says, will enable it to provide "more choice for football and gaming fans in the lead-up to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and FIFA Women's World Cup Australia & New Zealand 2023."


Now that its partnership with EA is officially over, FIFA says it's already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024. Before that, however, it'll be launching a number of "non-simulation games" with the initial selection due to release in the third quarter of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grounded, developer Obsidian's inch-high garden survival adventure, has just dropped another update on the road to its Version 1.0 release later this year, introducing what sounds like a sort of on-demand horde mode for players wishing to farm and battle particular enemies.


As explained in a new developer video, the idea behind Grounded's Bugs Strike Back update is to introduce - in "true Obsidian fashion" - Faction Reactivity. Essentially, the more players bother specific bug types in their quest for new materials - whether that be by killing them outright or merely invading their territory - the more likely those creatures will be to storm player bases to try and exact revenge.


While that'll happen automatically during play, those looking for a more on-demand-style experience can take advantage of two additional features. There's the new Waft Emitter device that enables players to summon specific bug types to a location for some wave-based mayhem by jamming in parts stolen from their downed brethren. The more parts used, the more intense the ensuing battle will be so players are recommended to proceed cautiously.

Designed in partnership with the disability community, the new adaptive accessories consist of three main components - an Adaptive Mouse, Adaptive Buttons, and an Adaptive Hub - with the idea being that users can augment the first two devices with 3D printed accessories in order to customise mouse and keyboard inputs in a way that best suits their needs.


The new Adaptive Mouse, for instance, can be customised with a thumb support and tail extension - or 3D printed tails - as required, while the Adaptive Hub serves as a means of either replacing or augmenting a traditional keyboard.

Online functionality for both games will cease on 30th June, meaning no more access to online matches or community-made content.


WWE 2K19, released in 2018, was the final game from long-time series stalwart Yuke's. WWE 2K20, released in 2019, was the disastrous follow-up solely made by Visual Concepts, previously the series' co-developer.

We reported in 2020 that PS3 players appeared to trigger the secret cutscene by disarming all nukes in the game's asynchronous online multiplayer mode. 


As it turns out - thanks to a new video from Did You Know Gaming - players didn't actually meet the requirement of zero nukes. Why? It's impossible.

Previous reveals have confirmed the likes of a new, more challenging Master Rank, new monsters, a new area in the form of The Citadel - which promises diverse biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece - and a new hub area in the bustling port town of Elgado Outpost.


That, though, isn't the end of the additions arriving in Monster Hunter Rise's "massive" Sunbreak expansion. As part of its latest reveal, Capcom has showcased three new monsters and discussed Sunbreak's flagship addition, Malzeno, in more detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After, let's be honest, a pretty long wait, Ubisoft has announced that The Division 2 will be getting a brand-new season.
The launch of season nine, which is known as Hidden Alliance will go live on 12th May and will add a new big bad to the game: Captain Lewis. As well as this hulking brute, there will also be four new mini bosses for players to square up against, or Lewis' "True sons" as Ubisoft calls them. 
This update will also introduce a new eight-player co-op mode called Countdown. As the name suggests, here players making up two teams will be given a 15-minute countdown to stabilize a power plant before it's locked down for good. The teams will be starting in different locations on the map and must work together to be victorious on their mission (so, you know, no pressure). You can check out the full season reveal below.

To explain, AFK rune farming has become a bit of an issue in the game. In order to easily get runes, some players have opened their game to invaders but hidden away in an inaccessible spot. When the invaders either die or leave the game in frustration, the host receives runes.


However, when Reddit user Teasnarker came upon a rune farmer, they decided to take revenge by trolling the troll.

And how have they chosen to demonstrate this new tech? Well - with, er, spiders.


Before we go on, let me quickly assure you that when I say spiders, I do not mean real spiders. Rather, just some small VR arachnids. So, once more to clarify, no real spiders (or people for that matter) were harmed in the making of this article.

But while that's a huge milestone - already 6m more than the Wii - Nintendo admitted its consoles sales were down 20 percent on last year, and blamed "shortages of semiconductor components and other parts". Last year's results were also boosted by the breakout popularity of Animal Crossing, Nintendo noted.


Nintendo Switch game sales saw no such slowdown. Software sales were up 1.8 percent year-on-year to 235m, meaning the past 12 months were the highest annual game sales figure ever recorded for a Nintendo platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Call of Duty developer Raven Software's vote on whether to form a legally binding union, Activision Blizzard has sent out anti-unionisation emails to its staff.


In a report by The Washington Post, employees revealed Raven management held several meetings and town halls ahead of the workforce's upcoming vote to unionise. During one such town hall, held on 26th April, Raven management reportedly inferred that any unionisation within the company would "impede game development and affect promotions and benefits". Following this meeting, employees then received an email with an attachment that simply read "Please vote no".


However, these emails do not appear to have had the desired affect for AKB, as many employees still went on to vote 'Yes' on their ballot cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 14 producer and director Naoki Yoshida has said third-party tools are not to be used with the MMORPG.


Square Enix released a full statement yesterday, noting "the use of third-party tools is strictly prohibited". However, the team intends to "review the most prominent tools, and in order to discourage their use, endeavour to enhance the functionality of the HUD".


The news follows the completion of the notoriously difficult Dragonsong's Reprise raid added in the latest patch. Team Neverland was the first to complete the raid and Square Enix shared a video of the win, before swiftly taking it down due to a copyright request.

However, those figures are lower than expected - by 3.3m consoles - following warnings by Sony it was struggling to get hold of components. 


Sony had hoped to shift 14.8m PS5 consoles this past financial year (the 12 months ending 31st March 2022) in order to match - if not outpace - the number of PS4s sold at the same point in its lifecycle.

Flight Simulator's Top Gun expansion was announced last June as part of the Xbox and Bethesday Showcase. It was initially due to launch last November along the upcoming Top Gun: Maverick movie but was delayed when Paramount Pictures made the decision to postpone the film's release into this year.
Asobo has yet to fully detail what Flight Simulator players can expect from its free Top Gun expansion, but we do know it'll include the F-18 among other things, and aims to give players first-hand experience of "what it's like to be a US Navy Top Gun".

The original Maid of Sker took its cue from Welsh folklore - retelling the supposedly true tale of Elizabeth Williams, said to have have died of a broken heart after being locked inside her home by her controlling father - and spun it into an richly atmospheric, if ultimately rather unadventurous slice of 19th stealth horror.


Follow-up Sker Ritual is quite a departure, however, switching out the methodical sneaking of its predecessor in favour of co-operative FPS action for up to four players as they try and "survive the onslaught and supernatural menace of the Quiet Ones".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Motive is readying to show more of its remake of Visceral Games' much-love sci-fi horror classic Dead Space, and will be shining a light (a small one obviously, so as not to ruin the gloomy ambience) on the game's art in a new livestream set to air this Thursday, 12th May.


This will be EA Motive's third developer livestream since the Dead Space remake's official unveiling last July, with the developer's first showing having focused on enhancements being made to the original's moody environments, zero-g traversal, and dismemberment and damage systems. Its second showcase, meanwhile, was all about audio.


EA's calling this third livestream Crafting the Tension, and promises a "deep dive into various aspects of the upcoming game’s art design". Specifically, it'll be talking about how it's using the power of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and modern PC hardware to "visually evolve and remake the original Dead Space's environments, characters, VFX, lighting and more from the ground up to create a new level of immersion and quality" for today’s audiences.

This year's Summer Games Done Quick serves up a week of speedrunning fun from Sunday, 26th June to 3rd July, and will feature more than 120 speedruns over its run-time, with all money raised during the show going to Doctors Without Borders.


As ever, this year's schedule is a pleasingly diverse thing, featuring retro classics, indie favourites, triple-A blockbusters, and a couple of oddities thrown in for good measure. The mighty Elden Ring is in there - perhaps inevitably given its speedrunning allure - and a further browse of the list reveals everything from Phasmophobia and Yakuza: Like a Dragon to Halo Infinite and McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure, all serving up various flavours of speedrun.

"That is not at all the issue why Mother 3 in particular never made it to the West," Fils-Aime said when asked about Mother 3's more sensitive topics. "It was all based on the business needs and the business situation at the time."

Well, that's what happened to the developers of Final Fantasy 16, when Bloodborne was first released. They pretty much had the exact same idea themselves, they say, but their game was cancelled before we got to hear about it. 

Writing in Japanese magazine Famitsu, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida detailed what could have been (via ResetEra). 

Yoshida and fellow Final Fantasy team members Hiroshi Takai and Hiroshi Minagawa reminisced about their previous game that was "basically Bloodborne", but before Bloodborne was even a thing.

Publisher Bandai Namco shut down the servers, meaning PC players are unable to play the games online - a key part of the experience through invasions, summoning, and messages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse (which manages all of miHoYo's global operations outside of China) has teased its upcoming game, Zenless Zone Zero.
The game's site is now live and shows a digital clock perched atop a retro TV. Meanwhile, off to one side, there is a calendar couting down to 13th May. More interestingly (and also more strangely), the dials on the TV can actually be twiddled by clicking on them and, when done so, one of two videos will start playing.
The first video is mostly static with a few blurry and erratic shots thrown in here and there. Throughout, an unknown man chats a lot about "Doomsday" and states, "in short, we're being reborn... and you're involved." If that doesn't make a lot of sense to you right now, don't worry. It doesn't to us either.

As reported by Reuters, the change comes as part of a crackdown on the booming games sector.


The National Radio and Television Administration said in a statement that livestreaming platforms need to step up controls for underage users (under 18).

However, a new PEGI rating for a Stadia version of the game popped up over the weekend, suggesting Capcom was back prepping the game for launch (thanks, Gematsu).

In the company's recent annual report (via CharlieIntel), Activision wrote: "We continued to demonstrate the potential for our console and PC franchises on mobile. Call of Duty Mobile enjoyed a record year following its launch in China, with annual consumer spending on the title of well above $1bn.
"Over 650 million people have downloaded Call of Duty Mobile around the world, and the number of people experiencing Call of Duty on mobile each month almost matched those playing on console and PC in 2021. This is no mean feat given the success of the free-to-play Warzone experience on console and PC."

Former Valve writer Chet Faliszek chatted about his time at the company with YouTube channel Kiwi Talkz (via VG247). Here, the writer revealed during the development of Left 4 Dead he, "went to dinner with Gabe and [Newell] was like 'if you look at zombie movies, Night Of The Living Dead is about racism, Dawn Of The Dead is about consumerism'".
When the Newell then asked Faliszek to explain "what his game was about", the writer replied: "well it's about working together, it's the game itself, it's a reflection of the game."

Essentially, players can watch specific Twitch streams to earn exclusive items to be used in-game. However, fans were frustrated and posted negative reviews for the game on Steam.


"In order to get these items... you have to watch hours and hours of inane Twitch streamers prattling on instead of actually playing the game you paid for. They also are timed so if you miss them you miss them forever," wrote one review. "If there was another way to earn these in-game it would not be a big deal but I'm not gonna watch ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Angry Joe for two hours just to get a weapon."

The Xbox Support Twitter account reported issues impacting the ability to launch Xbox games and play games via the Xbox Cloud on the evening of Friday 6th May, and then again on Saturday morning, and once more on Saturday night (UK times).


The outages have sparked a wave of complaints on social media, including from streamer and Xbox presenter Parris Lilly, who has called for greater transparency from Microsoft on how its digital rights management (DRM) policies work.

According to VentureBeat, this may be a stick or puck similar to Amazon and Roku devices, although there are also reports that an app for Samsung smart TVs is on the way, too, which is also expected to launch in the next year or so.

If true, it means players will not only be able to stream games to their PC and mobile devices, but also play them on TVs, all without the added expense of buying consoles or their expensive accessories.

In a candid blog post, Gilbert said the game had "a team of incredible artists, animators, sound designers, programmers, and testers all pouring their souls into this game and it’s beautiful to see, play, and listen to".

As Victoria so perfectly summarised for us earlier this week, the Monkey Island series has taken on a new look as well as a new creative team in its third outing, The Curse of Monkey Island. However, this new art style was not simply because of the change in management behind the game's development but because of the tools being used behind the scenes, and not all fans are happy with the new look.

Acutely aware that anyone can knock up a fake screenshot, I took the liberty of checking the PSN Store listing myself and yup, it's there in black and white, although the description itself curiously still says you can play "in solo-play or with one other hero and drop in on criminal activity wherever you find it".

It's yet another sign that the troubled game - which only released at the beginning of March - seemingly continues to struggle to maintain a player base on PC (Babylon's Fall is also out on PS4/5, but there's no similar way for us to monitor player counts for PlayStation consoles).

Just a couple of weeks back, we reported how SteamCharts - a site that, predictably enough, charts the performance of games on Steam - noted that in mid-April, global players on PC dropped below ten. Fast forward to May, and it looks as though like things are getting worse, with concurrent PC players failing to top 100 at all this week (thanks, VGC). Its highest ever peak sits at just 1166 players.

Legion Raids are difficult team-based activities that require teamwork to understand and execute the strategy necessary to counter each Legion Commander's unique characteristics, abilities, and mechanics," the team said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission has fined Nvidia $5.5m USD for failing to properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on revenue the company earned from the sale of its gaming GPUs - a failure the SEC says "deprived investors of critical information [needed] to evaluate the company’s business in a key market".


Announcing the results of its investigation, which specifically relates to Nvidia's actions during its fiscal year 2018, the SEC claimed that while the tech company had reported material growth in revenue within its gaming business at the time, it had failed to reveal to investors that - based on its own information - its gaming sales were driven in significant part by cryptomining.


Why's that important? As the SEC puts it, "These significant earnings and cash flow fluctuations related to a volatile business for investors to ascertain the likelihood that past performance was indicative of future performance."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite having already cancelled one attempt at turning EVE Online into an FPS, developer CCP's enthusiasm for the project apparently remains strong: it's now confirmed that, two years after Project Nova officially got the chop, work on a new FPS continues at its London Studio.


EVE Online FPS Project Nova was initially unveiled in 2016 as a spiritual successor to CCP's long-defunct free-to-play PS3 shooter Dust 514. Almost two years went by with ne'er a peep on the project, but then October 2018 finally brought a more extensive reveal. Unexpectedly, though, just a month later, CCP announced its intention to "return to the drawing board" with Project Nova, and 18 months after that, the game was officially no more.


Despite that rollercoaster ride, CCP said it remained committed to releasing an EVE Online FPS and that work on a new sci-fi shooter, with expanded scope, would continue at its London studio. That was more than two years ago, though, leading many to assume that the project had also run its a course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following comments last week that Final Fantasy 16 was in the "final stages" of development, producer Naoki Yoshida has offered a further progress update, confirming, among other things, that a new trailer for the long-awaited JRPG is expected to release soon.


Previously, Yoshida had told Uniqlo's UT magazine - where he was featured to promote a new Final Fantasy t-shirt line - that Final Fantasy 16 was "in the final stages of development" and that the team hoped to deliver a "comprehensive" experience "full of story and gameplay".


In new comments made during a Nier Reincarnation and Final Fantasy 14 crossover livestream, as translated by Twitch streamer Audrey (thanks Polygon), Yoshida joked to interviewer and Nier producer Yosuke Saito that Square Enix's American PR team "got mad" at him following the Uniqlo comments. Undeterred though, Yoshida was willing to speak a little further on Final Fantasy 16's progress, saying the game is "greatly coming together" but that he wants the development team to spend more time on polishing the experience.

As the trucks make their way through, red flares go off from the nearby buildings and celebratory gunfire can be seen and heard. The extras making up the crowds on these streets appear to be shouting "Freedom!" and "Fuck FEDRA!".

The report comes from developer People Can Fly (via Tweak Tower). Here, the company revealed the game is yet to make its publisher (Square Enix) any revenue. This was something that was suspected in August last year, when the developer said Square Enix was yet to pay it a royalty fee.
But, even in the several months following that initial statement, no royalty fee ended up coming People Can Fly's way in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has opened a probe into Sony's recent acquisition of Bungie. 
In January, Sony announced its plans to buy Destiny maker Bungie for a tidy $3.6bn. And, as has become the norm for deals such as this, the FTC has opened an in-depth investigation into this takeover. 
According to sources (via The Information), this investigation may set the closing date of this deal back by six months, if not more. While we were never given a firm date of when Sony had hoped to have this deal all squared away by on its initial announcement, reports now state that any closure will be happening early next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're discussing Square Enix's surprise sale of its western studios - Guardians of the Galaxy developer Eidos Montreal and Marvel's Avengers maker Crystal Dynamics - and what this might mean. 


Will a leaner, more focused Square Enix now itself be sold to an interested party (*cough* PlayStation)? Is this actually good news for mothballed series such as Deus Ex? And on a related note, we talk about the latest rumblings of a Ubisoft acquisition - and whether we think the Assassin's Creed creator is the next big games industry acquisition.


Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

For now, the trailer has only been released in Japanese, but it's still fairly clear what's going on. Characters shown off include Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, Rosalina, Toad, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario and Waluigi.
Mario Strikers Battle League was announced a couple of months back with a launch date set for Nintendo Switch on 10th June, though we've heard little about it since. Once again, series stalwart Next Level Games (of Luigi's Mansion 3 fame) is on development duties.

To put those numbers into a different perspective, that is over 30 percent of Activision's entire workforce (which, is roughly 9800), and close to half of its total developers (6800).
"We are working on the most ambitious plan in Call of Duty history, with over 3000 people now working on the franchise and a return to the Modern Warfare setting that delivered our most successful Call of Duty title ever," Activision wrote in its 2021 annual report (via Tweak Town).

This unique promotional console was crafted by THQ back in 2009 as a stunt to launch a mediocre minigame collection. The publisher famously tried to send the console to the Queen - though it never reached royal hands. 


Now, the console - arguably, a piece of gaming history - has been listed on auction site Goldin. As of the time of writing, the bidding stands at £2k.

Then, in January, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra released a blog post laying out the steps he said will "rebuild trust" in the developer. This included plans to hire new team members, whose roles would focus on improving the company's workplace culture. 
Following the arrival of Activision Blizzard's new chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer Kristen Hines last month, Blizzard has welcomed Jessica Martinez as its "first Vice President, Head of Culture."
Martinez's arrival will mark "part of [Blizzard's] ongoing initiative to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace culture where people at every level can learn, grow and bring their most creative selves to their work," Blizzard says.

The v1.24 release of Kubernetes brings storage capacity
tracking as a generally available feature.
Problems we have solved
As explained in more detail in the previous blog post about this
feature, storage capacity
tracking allows a CSI driver to publish information about remaining
capacity. The kube-scheduler then uses that information to pick suitable nodes
for a Pod when that Pod has volumes that still need to be provisioned.
Without this information, a Pod may get stuck without ever being scheduled onto
a suitable node because kube-scheduler has to choose blindly and always ends up
picking a node for which the volume cannot be provisioned because the
underlying storage system managed by the CSI driver does not have sufficient
capacity left.
Because CSI driv…]]></summary>

TennoCon has, of course, traditionally been a live, in-person event combining Warframe announcements, developer panels, and various community focused activities, but Digital Extremes made the decision to go online-only back in 2020 in reponse to the coronavirus pandemic, meaning this year's TennoCon will be its third fully digital show.


Unfortunately, beyond that 16th July date, Digital Extremes is yet to share much in the ways of details about this year's TennoCon, only saying that the all-day event will feature "exciting reveals" from the team, alongside a community art show.

Let's Build a Zoo, if you're unfamiliar, takes the familiar framework of classic zoo tycoons as its starting point, tasking players with importing and breeding animals, managing staff, and fashioning an appealing park using scenery items, shops, and amenities in order to keep guests happy and the money rolling in.


It offers two main twists on that familiar formula, however; there's a morality system - giving players the choice between keeping everything above board or taking a more exploitative path - plus the aforementioned DNA splicing angle, enabling players to create and exhibit the likes of crocoducks, giraffephants, and chickow.

Prey, of course, is yet another winner from Arkane Studios, the developer behind the critically acclaimed likes of Dishonored and Deathloop. As with those series, Prey, which released back in 2017, falls squarely in the immersive sim genre, this time taking the studios' focus on open-ended traversal and player choice into outer space.


Here, players take on the role of Morgan Yu and, after a memorably orchestrated opening sequence, find themselves onboard the space station Talos I somewhere in the year 2032. It's a gorgeously luxuriant setting - Eurogamer called it "perhaps the grandest and most beautiful facility of its kind ever imagined for a game" in its Recommended review - but all is not right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the news that Haden Blackman, studio head and founder of Mafia 3's developer Hangar 13, is stepping down from the role after seven years, a new report has claimed a fourth instalment in the Mafia series is currently in early development at the studio.
That's according to Kotaku, which reports that newly appointed studio boss Nick Baynes is leading development on a brand-new Mafia game, codenamed Nero. The project is said to be a prequel to the Mafia trilogy - which would suggest a return to the prohibition era action of the very first Mafia game, if not even earlier.
Additionally, Hangar 13 will reportedly be ditching its Mafia 3 engine - used in the recent Mafia 1 remake - in favour of Unreal Engine 5. It may, however, be some time before either the studio or publisher 2K Games is ready to talk about the title, given it's still "early in development".

"LucasArts was a client of a relative of my Fiancé back in the day, and he got to play test a lot of games, one of which was Star Wars: Battlefront 3, once it was cancelled, and all the assets were being gathered up to send back to Skywalker Ranch, one of the play test cartages for the PSP version got left behind. Him being young, he didn't think much of it and took it home, tested it out, AI battles, CTF, and Conquest all worked fine," the user wrote.

Announcing the festivities, Keighley promised a "live cross-industry showcase" with game announcements, reveals, and the indie-focused Day of the Devs.

However, this new art style was not simply because of the change in management behind the game's development. Rather, it was because of the tools being used behind the scenes.
"A new art path had to be developed for Curse of Monkey Island," game designer Jonathan Ackley revealed on Twitter.
"2D games of the time scanned drawings straight to raster, causing heavy aliasing. We used US Animation. It vectorised the line art before compositing and colour/resolution reduction, creating smoother art," he explained.

There's no word yet on a release date or platforms (beyond a vague promise of PC and consoles), but today's announcement and first look at development will likely be welcomed by fans who have missed Yuke's work over the past few years. 


Yuke's final WWE game was 2018's WWE 2K19, before publisher 2K Sports gave Yuke's the boot and chose US outfit Visual Concepts to take control of the series instead - with decidedly poor results (so much so that WWE 2K21 was cancelled altogether).

These include everything from Metal Gear Solid to Crash Bandicoot.
Taking inspiration from the likes of DC comics of old, these illustrations immediately evoke memories of a time since passed, but with a modern twist. My personal favourite is Dino Crisis – just look at the teeth on that triceratops!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streaming numbers are down across the board as the world opens up again post-lockdown.


That's according to the latest report from Streamlabs, which states that all platforms have seen a decline in growth in comparison to this time last year.


The Covid-19 pandemic is the main cause of both the rise and fall of streaming numbers. With more people working from home and spending less time on outdoor leisure activities, streaming viewership increased; now the world is opening up again, those numbers are declining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday we reported that Dying Light's Hellraider DLC was getting its final update. However, despite what was first assumed (by me at least), this is not the end of Techland's plans for its Zombie platformer. Rather, the company has announced a brand new Dieselpunk DLC, which is available from today (5th May).
"Go Back in Time with the New Dieselpunk DLC, discover historical Volkan Machines equipment crafted for world-class soldiers, and enjoy their unique design in Harran," the developer teased. This DLC comes with new gear, most notably a chainsaw known as the 'Gut Render' and a serrated sword known as the 'Flesh Ripper'. With these two weapons in your armoury, you will soon be slicing and dicing your way through those zombie hoards in a breeze.
If you prefer to be less up close and personal with your prey, perhaps the 'Greaser' firearm will be more your thing. In the words of Techland, this gun is the "new definition of swiss cheese". Of course, you could always just barrel through the advancing enemies with your new wheels, aka the 'Rugged Roadster'. Check out the blood-soaked trailer for this new DLC below.

Perry is discussing the relationship between Hitman's Agent 47, voiced by David Bateson, and his handler Diana Burnwood, who she voices. But she could also be talking about the actors themselves.


For both actors, auditioning for these roles was a serendipitous moment. Bateson had recently moved from London to Denmark, while Perry had moved from Canada to London: two actors living away from their native countries.

Volume expansion was introduced as a alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.8 and it went beta in 1.11 and with Kubernetes 1.24 we are excited to announce general availability(GA)
of volume expansion.
This feature allows Kubernetes users to simply edit their PersistentVolumeClaim objects and specify new size in PVC Spec and Kubernetes will automatically expand the volume
using storage backend and also expand the underlying file system in-use by the Pod without requiring any downtime at all if possible.
How to use volume expansion
You can trigger expansion for a PersistentVolume by editing the spec field of a PVC, specifying a different
(and larger) storage request. For example, given following PVC:
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: myclaim

Each of the 12 custom consoles features a unique colour scheme and design inspired by a different Lego-ised Star Wars character from across the nine Skywalker Saga movies. BB-8 is represented by an orange and grey Xbox Series S, for instance, while Boba Fett opts for orange and green, and Darth Vadar goes all-in on the black.


The full list of characters emblazoned on the custom consoles is as follows: BB-8, Boba Fett, Chewbacca, Darth Maul, Darth Vader, Finn, Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, Rey, Stormtrooper, and Yoda. Additionally, all 12 custom consoles feature controller designs that match their chosen character-themed colour schemes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new lawsuit filed by New York City Employees' Retirement System has alleged Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick fast-tracked a takeover bid from Microsoft in order to escape liability for wrongdoing following a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming he'd known about sexual misconduct at the Call of Duty publisher "for years".


Activision Blizzard has faced a relentless stream of shocking allegations relating to its workplace culture since last July, when a State of California lawsuit filing called the publisher "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". Building on that lawsuit, the Wall Street Journal published a report in November claiming Bobby Kotick had been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company "for years", but had failed to act on them or tell the board of directors and executives everything he knew.


It's these claims relating to Kotick's behaviour that form the backbone of a new lawsuit filed by the New York City Employees' Retirement System and pension funds, which owns Activision shares. The filing (as spotted by Axios) aims to secure documentation Activision has reportedly so far refused to release so that the plaintiff can carry out an investigation into the board’s "failure to maintain a safe and non- discriminatory working environment for its (specifically minority and female) employees, and failure to take action in response to repeated, grave allegations of misconduct, discrimination, and harassment by Activision’s senior executives."

According to a newly shared content roadmap, The Sims 4 will receive three new expansions of varying sizes over the next two months. EA is gathering all three together under the banner Seize the Night, and all are connected by a loose nocturnal theme.


At the smaller end of the scale are two new Kit packs, currently being teased under the names Chic Nights Out and Cozy Nights In, which perhaps points to a new selection of nightlife clothing in the first expansion and comfy new furnishings in the latter.

Not a bad sum for a game that only released in September 2020. This basically means that Genshin Impact makes roughly $1bn every six months. 
These impressive figures come from Sensor Tower, with the company saying: "Following its worldwide release, the title took 171 days to generate its first $1bn on mobile, not including spending through third-party Android stores. 
"It then took an extra 195 days to accumulate a further $1bn - resulting in the title picking up $2bn in its first year alone. Genshin Impact crossed the $3bn milestone 185 days later, meaning the game has averaged revenue of $1bn every six months, making it one of the most successful mobile games of all time."

Available via Steam for less than £2, it adapts familiar Resi weaponary and health items and tasks you with healing up and restocking a hero over various levels. 
Think of it as a window into Resi 4's safe rooms, translated into 40 puzzle scenarios of escalating difficulty, where Leon might pause for a few minutes to snort some herbs and shuffle around his guns to squeeze in a few more shotgun shells.

Writing in his newly-published Disrupting the Game memoir, Fils-Aimé said he was surprised to hear of plans for Game Boy Micro relatively late in its development, and despite Nintendo having moved on to focus on Game Boy Advance's successor, Nintendo DS.


In a section of the book posted online by VGC, Fils-Aimé also said he disliked the Micro's form factor. Overall, it was a "distraction", he concluded - something which he later moved to ensure became a "teachable moment" and not repeated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been a week for the "last of its kind" stories. Sony unveiled its last set of games for PlayStation Now subscribers, but developer Techland has additionally revealed its last ever update for Dying Light's Hellraid.
This free update for the game's dark fantasy inspired DLC will go live on 5th May and brings with it a variety of bug fixes and quality of life improvements. These all sound very nice, with balancing tweaks and economy changes across the board, but let's talk about the true star of the show - Hellraid's new (and only) firearm. Or, to give it its proper name, the Deathbringer shotgun.
A far cry from its fellow axes and swords of old, this shotgun is obtained by completing the Loaded for the Undead bounty (thanks, RPS) and certainly packs a powerful punch. Those pesky skeletons do not stand a chance, and will soon crumble into a bony pile of, well, bones thanks to the Deathbringer. I won't lie, it all looks very satisfying indeed - see for yourself below.

"How long did it take until Earthbound and the Mother franchise came up? Don't hold your breath," Fils-Aimé - who departed Nintendo three years ago - said. "Again, I'm not there, I don't know what's going on."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all love Mario Kart; it is a classic that has evolved and grown up with us and will surely continue to dominate various sales charts for many years to come. However, what if someone took this tied and tested formula, but then added in some of the classic 20th Television characters in place of Mario and co.? Well, we now have the answer. You would get Warped Kart Racers, Apple Arcade's upcoming karting game.
In Warped Kart Racers, players will be able to control one of 20 characters, including Hank from King of the Hill, Stan from American Dad! and Stewie from Family Guy to name but a few. In addition to these familiar faces, players will also recognise some familiar locales, as the maps that we could all soon be charging round are inspired by locations from "fan-favourite episodes".
Keen karters will be able to take to the tracks in either Warped Kart Racers' single player campaign or take part in a chaotic 8-player multiplayer mode. In addition to this, you will also be able to take on daily challenges to unlock new characters, skins, karts and other customisation options. You can check out the trailer for Warped Kart Racers below.

Last month, a Nintendo of America staff member filed an official complaint concerning alleged company interference in unionisation efforts - though Nintendo itself later responded to say the employee had been fired for disclosure of confidential information.
 Still, in the last two weeks, IGN and Kotaku have both published comments from various current and former contract workers at Nintendo, with criticism raised for how the company differentiates between full-time and contract staff in terms of pay, benefits and a feeling of inclusion, and claims it lacked a solid progression path to becoming a permanent employee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard has written to shareholders urging them to vote against against a New York State proposal that it should publish an annual report detailing the effectiveness and outcomes of its efforts to prevent abuse, harassment, and discrimination in its workplace. Similarly, it also wants shareholders to vote against a proposal to put an employee representative on its board.


As detailed in its latest shareholder filing, Activision Blizzard's board of directors is unanimously recommending shareholders vote against enacting the annual report, which would include several proposed metrics: the total number of pending sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or ligation; details of the company's progress toward reducing the average time it takes to resolve sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints; the amount of money it has spent settling disputes related to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, and finally pay and hours worked consolidated data.


While this kind of proposed transparency might seem prudent given that Activision Blizzard has been rocked by shocking allegations around its workplace practices since last July, and remains embroiled in a number of lawsuits relating to those practices - including last year's State of California filing, which described the publisher as a "breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women" - its board says it believes the proposal isn't "in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has revealed the development of its troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake - which was originally due to release in January last year - has been moved a new studio and will now release "when it's ready".


Prior to today's announced, the Sands of Time remake was being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai, but the project has been dogged by setbacks since its unveiling in September 2020. Shortly after its announcement, Ubisoft moved its launch date from January 2021 to March that same year, but February brought a second delay, this time indefinitely, while the team worked on delivering "a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original".


A subsequent update in June last year gave the Prince of Persia remake a revised launch window of 2022, and it's all been pretty quiet since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Furi, the now six-year-old psychedelic boss rush extravaganza from developer The Game Bakers, is poised to receive a new lease of life later this month on 17th May with the arrival of its newly announced Onnamusha DLC.


Furi - which The Game Bakers has previously described as a "love letter to Japanese action games such as No More Heroes, Metal Gear Solid and Godhand" - first released on PC in 2016, pitting its protagonist The Stranger against 12 incredibly stylish bosses. Each encounter played out very different - each boss requiring entirely new strategies to defeat - but it's all built around the game's streamlined one-on-one "dash-and-slash" action.


Onnamusha, then, aims to freshen up Furi's six-year-old core by giving players a brand-new protagonist that can be used throughout the existing Story, Speedrun and Practice modes.

Building on the acclaimed racing action of its 2016 predecessor, Redout 2 features 36 new tracks (plus mirror variants of each) which can be experienced in its 12-player online races or single-player career campaign - which promises "hundreds" of events from a variety of different modes, including the likes of Arena Races, Time Attacks, Last Man Standing, and Boss Races.


Elsewhere, the original game's extensive customisation options return, with players now able to start with one of 12 distinct chassis and then built on that from a selection of rocket engines, propulsors, stabilsers, rudders, magnets, intercoolers, flaps, wings, and spoilers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in February, Activision Blizzard revealed its long-running Warcraft franchise would be heading to mobile some time this year - and we now know exactly what form it'll arrive in thanks to the company's official reveal of free-to-play "tower offence" game Warcraft Arclight Rumble.


Arclight Rumble is being pitched as a combination of strategy game and tower defense, that sees players choosing from one of several leaders across five factions - Alliance, Horde, Beast, Blackrock, and Undead - each with their own abilities and specialisations.


Objectives vary depending on the chosen map (of which Blizzard is promising 70+ at launch), and these can range from skirmishes to boss battles. Players will need to deploy their units from their available "minis" - 60 collectible minis are being touted - and more powerful units can be deployed by gathering gold as a match plays out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has released a new trailer for its upcoming kids shows, giving us a new look at Sonic Prime.
I will cut to the chase, however. Yes, we do have some new footage of the spiked blue one roaring onto the screen as he collects up his golden rings, quipping, "I know what you're thinking - I'm goooood. And powerful, apparently. Jealous?!", but... well that is really all we get to see. On the other hand, it is nice to know that Sonic hasn't been given the boot following Netflix's recent animation purge, so every cloud. 
You can check out the footage for yourself below (PSA: unless you want to see what other kids shows are coming - some of which do certainly look like they are a lot of fun - skip forward to 1.49 to see Sonic's bit).

The test will be limited to the game's Online Seasons and Online Friendlies mode, and let you play together with a friend or against rivals, regardless of their console.


An image shared by EA as part of today's announcement showed a simple button prompt on the game's main menu to opt out of the cross-play test, if you so choose. Cross-play will also become an option in the game's matchmaking settings.

Discussing the long-requested threequel with former Nintendo Treehouse employees Kit and Krysta on their new podcast (thanks, Nintendo Life), producer Shinichi Kameoka was asked directly why Mother 3 had never seen the light of day outside of Japan.


"Personally, I think the biggest selling point of Mother 3 is [creator] Shigesatao Itoi's unique writing style," Kameoka replied, "translating the charm and nuances of his writing into other languages is quite a challenge, and maybe that's why it's taken so long to consider international releases of Mother 3."

"We firmly believe that the studios will excel under Embracer's operating model and ownership," Embracer wrote in a note to press, adding that the studios would continue to "breakeven" for the "the upcoming two financial years driven mainly by sales of the back-catalogue titles".

"That's part of the reason that we believe the overall semiconductor shortage will now drift into 2024, from our earlier estimates in 2023, just because the shortages have now hit equipment and some of those factory ramps will be more challenged," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Nintendo issued a warning for parents, asking them to ensure that their children always stand far enough away from the TV screen to avoid hitting it, and far enough away from others to avoid any unintentional fisticuffs. 
But alas, even after this warning, and the Wii-era experiences predating this time in our lives, it turns out that many still need to be reminded about the Joy-Cons handy little wrist straps, and why they are actually there. Specifically, when taking part in Nintendo's latest offering: Switch Sports.
Nintendo Switch Sports came out several days ago, and in that time, many have been streaming their own exploits in the fitness themed world it provides.

Dockershim Removed from kubelet
After its deprecation in v1.20, the dockershim component has been removed from the kubelet in Kubernetes v1.24.
From v1.24 onwards, you will need to either use one of the other supported runtimes (such as containerd or CRI-O)
or use cri-dockerd if you are relying on Docker Engine as your container runtime.

Dockershim has been removed as of Kubernetes v1.24, and this is a positive move for the project. However, context is important for fully understanding something, be it socially or in software development, and this deserves a more in-depth review. Alongside the dockershim removal in Kubernetes v1.24, we’ve seen some confusion (sometimes at a panic level) and dissatisfaction with this decision in the community, largely due to a lack of context around this removal. The decision to deprecate and eventually remove dockershim from Kubernetes was not made quickly or lightly. Still, it’s been in the works for so long that many of today’s users are newer than that decision, and certainly newer than the choices that led to the dockershim being necessary in the first place.

Since it’s the first one out the gate, we didn’t want to force players to finish the game before they’d be able to have fun with it," Smektała said. "I went through some of the speculations our community has expressed online, but I haven’t seen any of those theories get it right. So I hope that we’ll positively surprise people with this DLC."

It includes details about new features such as auto-hit, continue, and assist modes, all of which aim to boost accessibility. 

While the team believes "part of the fun" is Dead Cells' "tough but fair experience", Evil Empire says it knows "that it can be complicated for some people".

YouTuber Jamie Moran was even able to play it on their Xbox Series X and share the footage, stating on Twitter: "The First Forza Horizon game popped up again in the store. Such a fun game, it still holds up really well and it’s 4K on Series X & One X."

The game's sudden and unexpected reappearance six years after it was removed from sale has some fans speculating that it may be making a return. Without official word from the developer or Microsoft, however, we can only chalk this up to a mistake for now.

The latest game in the series, Forza Horizon 5, has seen more than 10 million players since launch. The impressive milestone means Playground's racing game has enjoyed the biggest first week in Xbox and Game Pass history.

Forza Horizon 5 looked like a hit even before it came out, when nearly one million people were already playing via early access on PC and Xbox ahead of the 9th November street date.

The original Forza Horizon game was briefly available to buy from the Xbox store yesterday.

While there's no official word on whether or not the game's return to the Xbox store was intentional, the racer has already been removed again, albeit not quite before some gamers managed to buy and download it (thanks, VGC).

"April Fools Day was my last day at Double Fine. I have learned so much over the past four years+ about who I am as a leader and what it means to be a creative visionary," she said in a recent tweet. "Thank you for trusting me to bring the world of Psychonauts 2 to life."

A tweet showed purported evidence that the recently-released Demon Gaze Extra had been specifically configured to prevent downloads to Steam Deck, which understandably worried early adopters of Valve's new handheld system.

Turns out it's just a big misunderstanding, something Valve now suggests was "accidental". It's also promised to "fix the issue" with any other games that similarly prohibit Steam Deck installations.

Call of Duty Warzone Season 3 released at 5pm on Wednesday 27th April - albeit a day earlier for Vanguard players - and the rush of players downloading and jumping into the new season has purportedly resulted in internet provider Virgin Media's busiest day of the year thus far - and its second-busiest since records began.

According to our sister site VGC, the average Virgin Media customer downloaded 12.1GB of data between 4pm and midnight on 27th April - that's up 29 per cent on the preceding week - whilst the busiest period of 8-10pm saw an uptick in data consumption, 11.9 per cent higher than usual and 23.8 per cent higher than the week before.

Whilst not formally confirmed by Microsoft nor Electronic Arts - so treat this as a rumour for now - both games now sport the Game Pass logo (thanks, XGP, via NME) on the former's online store, suggesting they may get their debut on Microsoft's subscription service next month. 

As FIFA 22 was released in October 2021 and Battlefield 2042 in November, this means both games will only be around six months old should they indeed be joining Microsoft's library of games soon.

That's according to a new developer diary in which Hinterland Studio reflects on the last eight years of development, as well as teasing what may be coming next, including a premium season pass to ensure the game "continues to be financially self-sustaining".

After focussing for so long on the sandbox and story modes, the team says it's now ready to "decouple" them, mitigating issues that founder Raphael van Lierop says made development "unwieldy" at times.

"Due to project progress, the Version 2.7 update will be postponed," the developer tweeted. "For detailed information on the date of the new update, content adjustment plan, and compensation, please stay tuned for upcoming announcements."

As we learned earlier this week, Sifu's new difficulty levels will come in three flavours - Student, Disciple, and Master - and Sloclap's latest preview trailer breaks each setting down in a little more detail. Disciple, for instance, will offer the "classic Sifu experience", and it's the option for those that want to continue playing the game as it is now.
Student, however, is designed for those wanting a slightly easier ride. It'll make the experience "more forgiving but still challenging", by increasing player health, making ageing more forgiving, and introducing weaker enemies with less aggressive AI that use simplified combos.

<p>At around 10 a.m., a nearby resident spotted the squid at Ugu beach in Obama, Fukui Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast. According to the Obama Municipal Government, the squid was still alive when it was found. It is unusual for a giant squid to be washed ashore alive, officials said.</p>
<p>The deep-sea creature will be transported to Echizen Matsushima Aquarium in the prefectural city of Sakai.</p></blockquote>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we teeter on the cusp of a brand-new month, Microsoft has whipped out its announcement horn to regale Xbox Live Gold subscribers with news of May's Xbox Games With Gold, which this month include Yoku’s Island Express and Viva Piñata Party Animals.


Yoku’s Island Express, which will be available to download from 1st-31st May is a strange but successful blend of platforming and pinball that Eurogamer's Christian Donlan liked a lot when it released back in 2018, calling it a "wild-spirited adventure to cherish."


Next up, and available to download from 16th May to 15th June, is The Inner World: The Last Wind Monk. This one, developed by Studio Fizbin (responsible for last year's striking Minute of Islands), is a follow-up to acclaimed 2013 point-and-click adventure The Inner World, and once again follows young, flute-nosed adventurer Robert on a quest to save the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom's been taking the slow and steady approach to revealing more on Monster Hunter Rise's Sunbreak expansion since its initial unveiling last year, but now, with its 30th June release approaching, the news is coming faster, and the publisher is promising "exciting reveals" and more for its next digital event on Tuesday, 10th May.


Precisely what will feature remains a mystery, but, alongside those aforementioned "exciting reveals", Capcom is also promising new gameplay, a look at some new monsters, and other currently unspecified treats. If your interest is suitably piqued, proceedings kick off at 3pm in the UK/7am PDT on 10th May via Twitch, and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak’s director, Yoshitake Suzuki, will be on presenting duties.


Capcom’s previous Sunbreak digital event was a biggie, giving us a release date, a look at some new monsters, as well as an introduction to the expansion’s new hub area - the bustling port town of Elgado Outpost - and its new map, The Citadel. The latter promises to deliver a diverse range of biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece - and we got an extended tour in a subsequent video.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In the post-pandemic era, video conferencing apps (VCAs) have converted previously private spaces &#8212; bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens &#8212; into semi-public extensions of the office. And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

This week, PlayStation Plus subscribers found they were unable to redeem pre-paid voucher cards and extend their subscription time - even if it was about to run out. Bewildered customers were told the situation was "temporary", but not given further explanation.


Now, Sony has updated its FAQ page for its upcoming PlayStation Plus changes and ackwnowledged the move - and said that, for now, you'll only be able to redeem pre-paid vouchers you have bought after your current Plus membership expires.

In a tweet from PlayStation, that also comes with a colourful teaser, the company revealed that Stray will be coming to consoles this summer. Previously we had been given an "early 2022" window but, given that we are now into Q2 and not been told a more concrete date, this new timeframe isn't exactly a surprise. 
Along with Stray, We are OFK will also be releasing this summer. Meanwhile Cult of the Lamb, which was previously only slated for a release "later this year" will be coming our way this autumn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After employees from Blizzard Versailles were made redundant in 2020, a move that preceded the studio's closure, those affected began a legal battle with the company. Now, staff that were made redundant have won their appeal.
As reported by French outlet Gamekult (via Gamesindustry.biz), an appeal court has invalidated the redundancies that led to the closure of the branch in 2020. As such, those looking to seek further legal actions will now potentially be entitled to "further compensations, equivalent to a minimum of six months of salary".
But while this is certainly still a victory in itself, it does not mean former Blizzard Versailles employees will find their positions reinstated in a different studio.

A court has dimissed much of Bungie's legal action against cheat site AimJunkies, in which it had alleged copyright and trademark infringement, as well as breach of contract, "tortious interference" and "unjust enrichment" (thanks, TorrentFreak).


AimJunkies had argued back and said its cheating software was its own work, not a copy of Bungie's code. The Destiny developer's other claims, it continued, should also be kept out of court per clauses in Bungie's own user license agreement. Now, a US judge has largely agreed.

Yes, I am talking about that damn fridge on the Milano that just will not stay shut. No matter how many times you get Star-Lord to close the door, it will always reopen again (and again and again and again).
But it turns out I am not alone in my quest to get that door closed (we need to save energy here people). In fact, that little seemingly benign door has been closed a grand total of 18.6m times. Much like the Guardians of Galaxy devs do as well, I admire the tenacity.

One of the highlights of hosting the weekly Kubernetes Podcast from Google is talking to the release managers for each new Kubernetes version. The release team is constantly refreshing. Many working their way from small documentation fixes, step up to shadow roles, and then eventually lead a release.
As we prepare for the 1.24 release next week, in accordance with long-standing tradition, I'm pleased to bring you a look back at the story of 1.23. The release was led by Rey Lejano, a Field Engineer at SUSE. I spoke to Rey in December, as he was awaiting the birth of his first child.
Make sure you subscribe, wherever you get your podcasts, so you hear all our stories from the Cloud Native community, including the story of 1.24 next week.

That's according to VentureBeat reporter Jeff Grubb in his latest Grubbsnax episode (as transcribed by VGC), who claims publisher EA and Respawn had initially been aiming to launch the Fallen Order sequel later this year, but that those plans have since changed and the game "is for sure now not coming out until 2023".


This later-than-planned release date combined with the decision to drop support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in favour of the newer consoles and PC means, according to Grubb, the development team won't "have to worry about trying to straddle these generation lines".

There's still some way to go until the deal is finalise, however; while Activision Blizzard stockholders - and, earlier in the week, board members - have now given the deal the go-ahead, it's still subject to regulatory review around the world, by the likes of the Federal Trade Commission in the US, to determine if the deal constitutes unfair competition.


Should the deal make it through regulatory review, the acquisition has until June 2023 to close, whereupon Microsoft will welcome some of the industries most recognisable franchises into its fold, including Call of Duty, Warcraft, Overwatch, and mobile hit Candy Crush.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's revamped PlayStation Plus isn't too far away now, with the company currently targeting a 22nd June launch in Europe, but questions around the service still remain, particularly concerning the library of games that'll be made to available to higher-tier subscribers. But while Sony's lips remain officially sealed, it appears the first batch of retro games coming to the top-end Premium tier have begun leaking onto PSN.


PlayStation Plus' new Premium tier gives subscribers access to around 340 additional games beyond the library of 400 PS4 and PS5 titles included in the mid-range Extra tier, focusing on retro games from PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3, and PSP. Sony is yet to offer specifics on either library, but users on Reddit have spotted that new listings for classic titles, complete with new thumbnail art, are starting to appear in the PSN backend, pointing to the beginnings of a roll-out for PlayStation Plus' retro games.


Granted, there are only three such titles to be found at present, all from publisher Bandai Namco - Tekken 2 and Mr. Driller for PlayStation 1, and Ridge Racer for PSP - but it does suggests the floodgates are slowly starting to open as publishers move to get their classic titles in order ready for the new PlayStation Plus launch.

The teaser, which played while 343 Industries community director Brian Jarrard and community manager John Junyszek were going through cosmetic unlocks in the Season 2 Battle Pass, showed the logo for a company called "Lux Voluspa" before we hear two voices panicking about a "missing core".

It has also begun a pledge, encouraging those in the industry, as well as those who are against the use of NFTs in general, to sign and make positive moves towards a "sustainable, socially responsible, equitable future for all".
Given the rise in blockchain technology, and the growing number of companies looking to implement it in their games, Climate Replay has additionally released a guide addressing everything that is wrong with NFTs.
"NFTs are the digital elephant in the room for the games industry right now, and many are feeling the pressure to pick a side," Climate Replay wrote (via TheGamer). "... This technology has massive implications for games, the climate crisis, and society at large. Our hope is that, by the end of this guide, readers will have a broad foundation of knowledge on top of which they can make truly informed decisions regarding NFTs."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of game testers working with BioWare on its new Dragon Age game are seeking to unionise.


The group, which is part of a contacted game services company named Keywords Studios, were recently told by that company they would need to return to office working full-time, five days a week, beginning in May (thanks, Kotaku).


In-office working - "embedded" within a developer - is one of the services which Keywords offers, and over the years the company has worked with BioWare and others to offer development support in this way.

Called Rengoku, the event lasts until 17th May and takes place in a modified version of the Skyscraper map. 


Players battle it out in a 5v5 capture point game mode that's similar to Domination in other shooters like Call of Duty, except the capture points move every two minutes. The first team to reach 300 points wins.

Several who have raised the matter with PlayStation customer support say they  have been told Sony has "temporarily" disabled the ability to stack Plus subscription time ahead of the new PS Plus changes due in June. 


Just yesterday, we covered how existing PlayStation Now owners with an active PS Plus subscription (who will get upgraded to the priciest PS Plus Premium tier) were trying to extend their PS Plus for as long as possible. Per PlayStation's own FAQ page, the company will take the longest-running active subscription when setting the converted membership's end date, essentially allowing Now members to stock up on regular Plus cards to receive the same time as a Premium subscriber.

The end results - Xbox's very own tartan, which is now on a controller (although I also spotted a rather dashing pair of trews, as well). 
"The pattern, using the brand's iconic colours, has been endorsed by the Scottish Tartans Authority and entered into The Scottish Register of Tartans," Xbox shared yesterday. "The landmark pattern and limited-edition controllers commemorate the history of Xbox with a contemporary design created by Edinburgh-based tartan designer Gordon Nicolson, makers of the Scotland National Football Team Tartan."
Check out a video showing the making of Xbox's new tartan below, as well as a closer look at a very smartly dressed controller (which appears to be a true Scotsman, as no underwear lies between the controller and its tartan cladding - cheeky).

Speaking at last month's SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, Fils-Aimé was asked what role blockchain, crypto and play-to-earn technology had in the future of gaming (thanks, Nintendo Life). 


He appeared to be quite enthusiastic about the idea: "So I'm a believer in blockchain, I think it's a really compelling technology. I'm also a believer in the concept of 'play to own' within video games, and I say this as a player where I may have invested 50 hours, 100 hours, or 300 hours in a game, and when I'm ready to move on to something else, wouldn't it be great to monetise what I've built?"

Anyone playing the game should stand a good distance from their TV, the advice continued, so you do not hit the Joy-Con controller on the screen.

Parkasaurus, for those yet to experience the game's vibrant, dino-infused spin on the classic theme park management formula, challenges players to build and run their very own dinosaur-flavoured tourist attraction - a task requiring them to hurtle back to the past to unearth new dinosaurs then build the perfect habitats to keep them happy, ensuring their specific terrain, water, food, privacy, and scenery needs are met.


And on top of all that, there are the usual park management demands to content with, ranging from landscaping and staff wrangling to ensuring all guests' needs - be they food, entertainment, merchandise, or bowel related - are adequately catered for.

The set-up for Dreamlight Valley goes that, once upon a time, a bunch of Disney and Pixar characters all lived happily together in the idyllic land of the title - until, that is, a cataclysmic event known as the Forgetting stole everyone's memories. It's up to players, then, to explore and restore the kingdom (and its inhabitants' memories too), in an adventure that combines life-sim-style action with more traditional questing.


As Dreamlight Valley unfolds, players will be able to travel to exotic biomes beyond the village and befriend classic Disney and Pixar characters - each with their own story arcs, quests, and rewards - including the likes of Elsa and Anna in a snowy, Frozen-inspired kingdom, Ariel in a tropical corner of the world, and even the Lion King crew across a sunny savanna.

We’ve tracked publicly known in-the-wild 0-day exploits in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a> since mid-2014.</p>
<p>While we often talk about the number of 0-day exploits used in-the-wild, what we’re actually discussing is the number of 0-day exploits detected and disclosed as in-the-wild. And that leads into our first conclusion: we believe the large uptick in in-the-wild 0-days in 2021 is due to increased detection and disclosure of these 0-days, rather than simply increased usage of 0-day exploits...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its ongoing war against cheaters, the team behind Call of Duty's server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution has announced it's implemented a new mitigation technique, known as Cloaking, that will prevent cheaters from seeing opponents during a match.


As explained in new blog post highlighting the latest developments for Call of Duty's Ricochet anti-cheat solution, Cloaking follows a similar philosophy to its previous Damage Shield initiative in that it's designed to "give legitimate players a leg up on cheaters."


While Damage Shield effectively turned on God Mode for all legitimate players when a cheater was detected in a match, Cloaking aims its focus squarely at the cheater, making it impossible for them to see opponents, bullets, and even sounds. "Legitimate players, however," the post explains, "can see cheaters impacted by cloaking (generally, they’ll be the players you see spinning in circles hollering, 'Who is shooting me?!') and can dole out in-game punishment."

This means anyone still with an active Now subscription who has also stacked a PS Plus sub for months (or even years) to come will get converted to Premium for as long as their existing Plus sub is set last.


The difficulty in taking advantage of this now is that Sony has stopped selling Now subscriptions - presumably to deter people who were previously not Now subscribers but who are after a bargain.

These enemies have humanoid facial features and will attack when approached. However, these mysterious creatures are often heard before they are seen, as (as their name suggests) they sing a rather haunting song known as the Song of Lament.
This song is sung in Latin, adding to the mysterious aura that surrounds these bats. However, one player has recently discovered a translation of the bats' song and revealed its unsettling translation.
Twitter user Chinchillazilla (via Screen Rant) wrote, "just learned that the singing bats in Elden Ring are singing in Latin and their song is a huge bummer". The user then went on leave a copy of the translated song for others to mull over.

Indeed, the language of today's call from British Gas has been criticised for passing the blame for high bills onto consumers. There have also been questions asked about the numbers British Gas has used to calculate its savings.
