        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moonglow Bay, developer Bunnyhug's "slice-of-life fishing RPG", is readying to raise anchor and set sail for Xbox, PC, and Game Pass on 7th October.
Set in a struggling 1980s Canadian coastal town where people are afraid to fish, Moonglow Bay draws inspiration from the likes of Harvest Moon and Legend of the River King, aiming to "capture the magic of fishing and make it the heart of everything".
Players take on the role of a rookie angler trying to full their partner's last wish and keep their business afloat - a task Moonglow Bay thankfully pitches more toward relaxing village-life sim than soul-sapping struggle on the brink of destitution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blasphemous, developer The Game Kitchen's superb gothic action-platformer, is wrapping up its brooding redemption adventure on 9th December with the arrival of another free story expansion, titled Wounds of Eventide, plus there's a fully fledged sequel due in 2023.
Blasphemous, which released to well-deserved acclaim back in 2019, tells the story of The Penitent One, a pointy hatted fellow with a barbed-wire sword, forced to venture across the accursed kingdom of Cvstodia - a desolate, but lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness.
It's wonderful stuff, serving up an engaging blend of 2D Souls-like and Metroidvania bolstered by some fascinating world-building and gorgeously wrought, grimly unforgettable imagery. Needless to say, it was an absolute pleasure to return to Blasphemous the following year when The Game Kitchen continued The Penitent One's tale in its free The Stir of Dawn DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Truck Simulator is finally ready roll out to a brand-new destination, with its long-awaited Wyoming expansion now confirmed for release on 7th September.
Wyoming is the eighth state to be added to American Truck Simulator since its launch in 2016 - following developer SCS' increasingly lavish recreations of Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, and Colorado - and opens up myriad new routes for long-distance haulers and landscape fetishists to enjoy.
Wyoming will link up American Truck Simulator's previous Colorado, Idaho, and Utah expansions for more convenient cross-country trucking, just leaving a Montana-shaped gap at the very top of the game's map. Of course, we already know SCS' next destination is to the east, with the developer having confirmed it's hard at work capturing the vast sprawl of Texas for its next expansion release as it slowly ticks off all 50 states.

With the release of No More Heroes 3 today, which got a Eurogamer Recommended badge and an overwhelmingly positive review, its creator, Goichi Suda, announced the game will be the last in the series. 
"As hinted at with the 'Final' thing, Travis Touchdown will finally be coming to the end of his final battle, and will be embarking on a much-deserved, long journey. Join him as he goes absolutely buck wild in the Garden - no, Cosmos of Madness!" Suda shared in a statement.

Quickly, then, developer Volition has revealed a longer, more in-depth look at the game's Santo Ileso setting via our first proper peek at in-game footage.
Santo Ileso's south-western US setting is a departure for the series - though Volition developers here make the case that it will still be "strange". Next, its cast of four main characters who become friends - the Boss (that's you), Eli the investor, Nina the gearhead and Kevin, a shirtless wannabe TV chef.

This means, for example, a game company who holds a user's email address could then contact that person to suggest they buy a season pass or in-game currency directly from them, rather than via the App Store where Apple takes its cut. 
Until now, Apple did not let developers use any contact information obtained from within an app to contact their users outside of the app. A class-action lawsuit said this was unfair, and blocked the ability for them to inform customers of cheaper purchase options (thanks, Ars Technica).

Kart Krash: Full Auto sees players fight to be the last one surviving in teams or chaotic free-for-alls, using the weapons attached to their go-karts and assorted power-ups scattered about the map to take their opponents out. It's a bit like Mario Kart's Battle Mode, except there's tanks and machine guns. 
Go-karts aren't new to the game, having arrived back in December with The Cayo Perico Heist. But the new game mode dedicates these vehicles to their own arena.

It promises to bring stable 60fps performance, private lobbies and updated liveries for the 2021 GT World Challenge series, and there'll be a free update path for owners of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to their respective next-gen upgrades. 
Assetto Corsa Competizione first came out on PC in 2018, with its sole purpose being to replicate the GT World Challenge series (the series formerly known as Blancpain GT), which sees the Spa 24 Hours as its centrepiece. The initial console port was decent if lacking in some areas - areas which this next gen update would seem to address.

If you weren't aware, Steam offers a refund for all game purchases, no questions asked, as long as your playtime is less than two hours and it's within two weeks of purchase. 
It's a ‌pro-consumer policy (or a cost-effective way to reduce the number of customer service staff, depending on who you ask), and the two-hour playtime threshold is intended to stop less trustworthy consumers from exploiting it.

This blog describes the notion of Availability for StatefulSet workloads, and a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.22 which adds minReadySeconds configuration for StatefulSets.
What problems does this solve?
Prior to Kubernetes 1.22 release, once a StatefulSet Pod is in the Ready state it is considered Available to receive traffic. For some of the StatefulSet workloads, it may not be the case. For example, a workload like Prometheus with multiple instances of Alertmanager, it should be considered Available only when Alertmanager's state transfer is complete, not when the Pod is in Ready state. Since minReadySeconds adds buffer, the state transfer may be complete before the Pod becomes Available. While this is not a fool proof way of…]]></summary>

Reports of Netflix's plans to enter the world of video games began to circulate in May, and the company finally made it official in July, saying it was "in the early stages of further expanding into games" and that it viewed gaming "as another new content category for us."
It also clarified it would initially focus on mobile games, with a later report suggesting the first batch of these titles would launch as part of Netflix's subscription service some time next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix's previously Switch-exclusive JRPG sequel Bravely Default 2 is making its way to Steam early next month, on 2nd September.
Bravely Default 2 - the follow-up to 3DS JRPGs Bravely Default and Bravely Second: End Layer, which released in 2012 and 2015 respectively - launched on Switch back in February this year, charting the adventures of a new band of heroes on the continent of Excillant.
Its story begins when young sailor Seth washes onto the shores of one of the continent's five regions. He eventually joins forces with Gloria - a princess forced to flee her own kingdom - alongside travelling scholar Elvis and the mercenary Adelle, for a familiar blend of narrative-driven exploration and turn-based combat built around the series' Brave/Default mechanic, which essentially lets players strategically bank turns to unleash in one massive blast later on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports back in July that open-world zombies-and-parkour survival hit Dying Light would be making its way to Switch, developer Techland has now made it official.
Dying Light has been a massive success for Techland - the developer says the game has now been played by over 20 million players since its launch back in 2015 - and it's received an absolute stack of DLC, both free and paid, over the years as a result (and, of course, a sequel is due on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox this December).
All that DLC was bundled together for a special Platinum Edition of Dying Light on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox earlier in 2021, and it's this version that's now been confirmed to be making its way to Switch at some currently undisclosed future point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[September is almost upon us, meaning a fresh batch of Games With Gold titles to download for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, this time including Zone of the Enders HD Collection, Warhammer: Chaosbane, and more.
First out the gate is Zone of the Enders HD Collection for Xbox 360, which will be available as part of Games with Gold between 1st September and 15th September. Initially release in 2012 (where it was infamously so poor it ended up getting an extensive patch from an entirely different porting studio), it features high-definition remasters of the Hideo-Kojima-produced Zone of the Enders and Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner, each serving up a celebrated blend of mech-based third-person shooting and hack-and-slash action.
From 1st September to 15th September, Games with Gold subscribers can download Warhammer: Chaosbane, a Diablo-esque fantasy action-RPG set in the middle of Warhammer's Old World history. Players can take on the role of human, high elf, wood elf, or a dwarf as they batter their way through familiar locations - including the cursed city of Praag and Nuln, the old capital of the Empire - in their ceaseless quest for shiny loot. And who doesn't love loot?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Gamescom trailer released last night has given us our best look yet at House of Ashes, the third game in Supermassive's The Dark Pictures Anthology. 
The trailer also includes a hidden URL (scribbled on a piece of card visible at the 1:24 mark) which leads to a mock US military website full of extra lore details on House of Ashes' story.
The only downside to that trailer? A big ol' advert for the game's "Pazuzu Edition" comes right at the end, showing a highly-detailed figurine of the game's monster. The creature is something trailers have so far only teased, and while this isn't the first time this advert has been shown, it's still jarring to see it plonked at the end. Oh well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sifu, the martial arts adventure from Absolver developer Sloclap, finally has a release date and will release for PlayStation and PC on 22nd February next year.
Sifu is a a third-person, single-player action game, focussed on "intense hand-to-hand combat", that follows a young Kung Fu student on a path of revenge as he hunts down his family's murderers with nothing but a mysterious pendant and, possibly, the ability to palm-smash someone's nose out the back of their head.
Actually that's not quite true; as players make their way through Sifu's world - "from the gang-ridden suburbs to the cold hallways of the corporate towers" - they're encouraged to use everything at their disposal to overcome the odds and hunt down their targets, whether that be throwable objects or makeshift weapons strewn around the environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sci-fi exploration adventure Jett: The Far Shore - a collaboration between Pine Scented Software and Superbrothers (the creators of acclaimed 2011 indie hit Sword & Sworcery) - now has a release date and will be making its way to PC and PlayStation on 5th October.
Announced last summer, the moodily atmospheric Jett casts players as scout and 'anchorite' Mei as she becomes the first person to explore a mythic ocean planet in order to "carve out a future for a people haunted by oblivion" and search for something called "the hymnwave". 
"Skim low over waves, roar up pristine coastlines and carve through otherworldly woods," teases the developers. "Adapt to an intricate, systemic open world and persevere through adversity alongside an intimate ensemble cast in this story of courage, wonder and regret."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a succession over-the-top adventures that folded in alien invasions and superpowers with Saints Row 4 and its subsequent follow-ups, Volition is bringing its open world crime series back to its roots with the next year's Saints Row - a reboot that reintroduces a more grounded contemporary fictional setting while still looking to hold onto the humour and possibilities that Saints Row has become beloved for. 
Titled simply Saints Row, the new game will be a cross-generational affair that's coming as soon as next February, and sees a player-created character heading up a gang of four as they go on to establish a criminal empire. Among that group is Eli, a nerdy planner with an MBA, Neenah, who provides the driving talent and Kevin, who, er, has some lovely abs? Then there's the player character themselves, defined by the player using some of the same deep customisation options seen previously in the series - and the group's make-up promises to play into the co-op that is also at the heart of this Saints Row reboot. 
Providing the playground this time out is Santo Ileso, which draws heavily upon the American south west. It's broken down into nine distinct districts, including the downbeat Rancho Providencio, Las Vegas analogue El Dorado and the secluded suburban Monte Vista. In the heart of the city there's an extended emphasis on verticality (and the promise of some tools to make the most of all that, with wingsuits and ziplines that catapult players into the air).

Players familiar with the original 2018 game should be immediately at home with Evolution 2, which once again tasks budding managers with building and maintaining their own dinosaur theme park, laying out exhibits, tending to visitors needs, and, of course, making sure the attractions don't eat the guests.
It's not all business as usual though; Jurassic World Evolution 2 shifts the action away from the exclusively tropical setting of Muertes Archipelago, as seen in the first game, and gives players the chance to build their parks across a diverse range of new environments - from dense forests to scorched deserts - each with unique environmental challenges, including bespoke weather such as sandstorms and snow.

The Skywalker Saga, an all-new retelling of Lucasfilm's nine Star Wars films built in a new engine, was announced at E3 2019 for a late 2020 release. However, it's now seen two delays - the most recent in April this year - leaving many to wonder when it would finally resurface.
And the answer, of course, is today, with Opening Night Live serving up a fresh look at The Skywalker Saga in a brand-new trailer blending cutscenes and gameplay of familiar moments from right across the Star Wars nonology, all given a typically comedic Lego game twist.

I'm less impressed by its monsters - a collection of oddball creatures which in turn look like animals, robots or piñatas. It's also unclear exactly how battles will work - they look real-time, with items and weaponry seemingly summoned out of thin air.

        <updated>2021-08-25T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might've heard the rumours of a "Marvel XCOM", coming from tactics specialist Firaxis, and turns out: they're mostly true. During Gamescom's Opening Night Live stream, the studio revealed Marvel's Midnight Suns, described as a "tactical RPG" - although from talking to creative director Jake Solomon, it's quite a bit less XCOM-y than some of those tweets and reddit threads may have led you to believe. 
So, what's it all about? Midnight Suns is set in the "darker side of the Marvel Universe", based on a '90s comic book series called Rise of the Midnight Sons - although apparently it's deliberately not an exact retelling of those events. The setup for the game is this: perpetual baddies Hydra have revived someone called Lilith, who does a bit of dead-raising that threatens to overrun the Avengers (Iron Man, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Dr. Strange, and Wolverine can be spotted in the trailer). The Avengers call up a few extra supernatural mates to help out, called the Midnight Suns, which includes Nico Minoru, Blade, Magik, and Ghost Rider, and a few more (12 Marvel heroes in total), and together they then resurrect some help of their own: one more hero, newly created for the game, called the Hunter, who's also Lilith's child and apparently the only one able to kill her.
The Hunter, who's customisable (in "appearance" and also in terms of a choice of about 40 different abilities), is who you'll be playing as, which is where things immediately depart from the XCOM formula. You'll be controlling both the Hunter and the other heroes in combat, with battles featuring three heroes total at a time, but then the time between battles is spent in one of two ways: managing your base, a mystical safehouse called the Abbey - so far so XCOM - or actually walking around the Abbey in third-person, over-the-shoulder view, exploring its "extensive" grounds and interacting with the other heroes.

Little Nightmares 2's Enhanced Edition aims to give the already richly atmospheric experience - which follows the adventures of new protagonist Mono and returning character Six through the grim streets of Pale City - an even moodier boost with a range of primarily visual enhancements.
There's ray-traced reflections, for starters, bringing live reflections to Little Nightmare's various shiny surfaces, as well as improved volumetric shadows - which, as publisher Bandai Namco explains in its announcement post, "add even more depth and detail to every object and enhance how rays of light are interrupted by moving objects".

It can show which server communicated with another, information that may ordinarily only be available to the server owner or the ISP carrying the traffic.

BattlEye was added to Destiny 2 last night as part of the game's 3.3.0 update. Alongside this, Bungie published a security update blog detailing its arrival - and what it may mean for performance.
"Anti-cheat solutions require some additional system resources to keep watch and you may see some reduction in frames and performance after Update 3.3.0 goes live," Bungie wrote. "The new service will also increase the initial startup of the game."

These documents, California says, should have been kept pending its own legal investigation (thanks, Axios). 
The state has also criticised Activision Blizzard for enforcing NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) which have hampered staff efforts to speak out, and for involving third-party legal firm WilmerHale to investigate - something California says "directly interferes" with its own efforts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've finally wrapped up every last challenge from Sea of Thieves' utterly stupendous Pirates of the Caribbean story expansion and are in need of new adventure, Rare has a fresh batch of chaos for players to embark on, courtesy of a new Borderlands-themed collaboration event.
Sea of Thieves' newly announced Making Mayhem event is, as its name suggest, all about causing a ruckus out on the waves, challenging players to earn Favour with the Bilge Rats by completing a range of different (and largely explosion-focussed) activities. 
Minor Mayhem challenges give pirates the opportunity to earning a "fair" amount of Favour by doing things like detonating Gunpowder Skeletons in a chain reaction or destroying a Ghost Ship, while Major Mayhem challenges are considerably more lucrative. A "good" amount of Favour can be earned by opening one of the Gold Hoarders' Treasure Vaults, for instance, and other activities, such as completing a Tall Tale, reward a "huge" amount of Favour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Team17 and developer Drop Bear Bytes have joined forces to bring Australia-themed post-apocalyptic cRPG Broken Roads to Steam and consoles next year.
Broken Roads tasks players, and their accompanying party of up to five characters, with traversing a "content-rich and densely-crafted" post-apocalyptic future version of Western Australia, visiting real-life locations along the way. The experience is - as even a quick glance at the trailer below will confirm - heavily inspired by classic single-player cRPGs, and features a blend of turn-based tactical combat, alongside "traditional and original" RPG mechanics.
There's a "classless" character system, offering "nearly unlimited...development options", and something Drop Bear calls the Moral Compass. Acting as a kind of enhanced morality system, this sees dialogue options and questing decisions influence - and be influenced by - a character's philosophical leanings, with the game featuring four philosophical paths, each with their own unique traits.: Humanist, Utilitarian, Machiavellian, and Nihilist.

The show started with another look at Dying Light 2, and a sunset-drenched "modern dark ages" post-apocalypse full of parkour gameplay. Techland's long-awaited sequel arrives 7th December.
Next up was an extended look at Microsoft Flight Simulator with the chatty Jorg Neumann, who talked more about the game's upcoming sixth world update covering Germany, Austria and Switzerland which is due on 7th September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playground Games has shown off the typically spectacular intro sequence for Forza Horizon 5 in a new gameplay video, confirming the game's cover cars as it did so - but had little in terms of concrete new detail to share on the open-world racing game.
The sequence sees the player air-dropped from a cargo plane, by parachute, in a series of signature cars, all over the game's Mexico map.
First up is a 2021 Ford Bronco Badlands, a rugged, retro-styled SUV that is dropped right next to a smouldering volcano crater, dusted with snow. It's winter up here, but a vertiginous descent takes us down into a baking desert and a brief glimpse of a Baja rallying circuit.

The console version is being developed in conjunction with Lab42 and promises to "utilise key capabilities" of the Xbox Series X/S and PS5, "like super-fast load times for a seamless gameplay experience".
"Xbox Series X/S players will be able to quickly switch between gameplay and consulting a YouTube tutorial on how to quell a peasant revolt," Paradox says in its announcement. "PlayStation 5 users will experience the game's stress mechanics themselves, as their DualSense controllers physically react to in-game events as they unfold."

That, however, is just the beginning, with the developer having now confirmed two new aircraft, plus a competitive multiplayer mode arriving this autumn.
World Update 6, as we already knew, arrives on 7th September and aims to drastically enhance Flight Simulator's rendition of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Alongside visual upgrades, it'll introduce around 100 famous handcrafted landmarks, four new airports - Lübeck, Stuttgart, Klagenfurt and St. Galle - plus new discovery flights, landing challenges, bush trips, and more.
That "and more" was elaborated on during tonight's Xbox Gamescom Showcase, and takes the form of a new pilotable plane: the Junkers JU-52. This 1930s German aircraft arrives as part of a new series of paid DLC Asobo is calling Local Legends, introducing new planes well-known in the local area of each World Update, but which are perhaps less well-known to a worldwide audience. The Junkers JU-52 arrives on 7th September and will cost $14.99 USD.

Slap them All! unfolds in the Roman-occupied Gaul, circa 50 BC, where, as publisher Micriods puts it, "Only one small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders."
Those Gauls, of course, include Asterix and Obelix, who players will be able to control as they journey (either solo or with a friend via local co-op) across iconic locations from the comic books, battling Roman legionaries, pirates, brigands, "and even the dreaded Normans". The ensuring hand-animated adventure, as you'll see in the trailer below, looks glorious.

Details regarding the PlayStation version are limited - there's a release date and description and that's about it - but The Touryst (which debuted on Switch in 2019 before heading to Xbox and PC the following year) remains a fun little excursion, depositing players on the glorious Monument Islands holiday resort for a spot of sun, sea, and exploration-driven adventure.
On a basic level, the goal is to progress from island to island - all rendered with an appealing, retro-inspired voxel art style, and each with its own theme - in order to infiltrate the mysterious monuments strewn around and solve the mix of puzzles and platform challenges within.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive could soon be bringing its superb medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 to consoles according to a newly uncovered listing by the Taiwanese ratings board.
As spotted by Gematsu, three relevant listings (seemingly now removed) have found their way onto the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee's website; one for Crusader Kings 3 on PlayStation 5, one for the game on Xbox Series X/S, and another for Xbox One.
Of course, nothing is official until Paradox makes it so, but the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee has good form when it comes to leaking game announcements ahead of time, with everything from Crash Bandicoot 4 to last year BioShock ports for Switch having appeared on its website prior to their official unveilings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Odyssey players on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 will soon be able to hurtle across ancient Greece at 60fps, courtesy of a new game update releasing tomorrow, 24th August.
In its current form, Odyssey retains the 30fps limit seen on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro when playing on Sony and Microsoft's newest consoles via backward compatibility, meaning players are in for an extremely welcome 100% frame rate boost when the update arrives.
According to Ubisoft's announcement post, that'll happen at 7am tomorrow, 24th August, in the UK. Meanwhile, those that set their watches to Pacific Daylight Time won't have to roll into a new day - it's out tonight, 23rd August, at 11pm PDT.

It's a slightly odd announcement, given it mentions the players only, as opposed to having the league also officially licensed. Perhaps this means the MLS players will be free agents in the game.
The trailer, below, shows LA Galaxy's Jonathan Dos Santos expressing his delight at the news.

Company mismanagement and poor sales of the ambitious RPG meant 38 Studios collapsed shortly after it became clear Kingdoms of Amalur was not going to be a World of Warcraft-style hit.
This left nearly 400 developers adrift, and waiting for their final paycheck - until now. A new report from Bloomberg [paywall] states staff are now belatedly receiving their last pay packet - albeit just a fraction of what they were owed (thanks GamesIndustry.biz).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades is currently the best-rated game for PS5 and Xbox Series X on Metacritic.
Although the indie roguelike was only released for current-gen consoles last week, it's surpassed every single competitor released on the new consoles since they debuted back in 2020, securing a top aggregated Metacritic score of 94 on Xbox Series X and 93 on PS5. 
Given the hundreds of titles that have been released on PS5 and Xbox Series X thus far it's an incredible achievement, not least because for the former, Hades has secured an aggregate score higher than games like Demon's Souls (92) and Borderlands 3 (91). On Xbox, on the other hand, it's topped Ori and the Will of the Wisps (92) and Microsoft Flight Simulator (90) (thanks, TwistedVoxel).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Content creators on Twitch are planning a one-day strike to force the streaming service to better support marginalised streamers who are doxed or attacked whilst working.
Using the hashtag #ADayOffTwitch, the protesters hope that by refusing to log on and create - or even spectate - Twitch streams on 1st September, it'll hit the company's purse and compel it to listen, and better support, the creators who suffer regularly from "hate raids" and organised attacks. 
The idea for the boycott comes from Rek It Raven, LuciaEverBlack, and Shineypen (thanks, PC Gamer), and together, they're trying to convince other Twitch streamers and viewers to do the same.

In an interview with Total Film, Isaac talked about his current commitments, which include the Metal Gear Solid film from director Jordan Vogt-Roberts. 
"I just loved the game," Isaac said (thanks, GamesRadar+, via NME). "I love the feeling that the game would give me every time I'd play. It's just a strangely isolated, mournful, lonely game to play that has these incredible moments of violence and terror, with these weird, psychedelic concepts and villains. But, yes, it's kind of like psychedelic military horror things that happen.

In a brief tweet on the developer's official social media channels, Capcom said this update - the second in the developer's fight to stabilise the horror game on PC - fixes an issue where "certain" unspecified CPUs were "unable to launch the game", as well as the "minor fine-tuning of certain graphical processes", although what, exactly, graphical processes the update will address. 
A few weeks back, hackers hit the headlines by insisting that the stuttering and dropped framerates experienced by players on PC were caused by the game's own anti-piracy measures - something Digital Foundry was able to test and prove, too.

Emma reported on the mod in July, speaking with lead developer and maritime engineer from the Netherlands, Robin Bongaarts. Bongaarts has been working on the project since September 2006, and finally now a portion of it has been released.
It's worth noting part one does not include the sinking of the Titanic. This is planned for a later release. Nor does it include a fully-fleshed out storyline, or the full interior of the ship itself.

New Zealand-based Unreal tinkerer and YouTuber Reuben "Reubs" Ward decided to challenge himself to to just that - well, the game's first mission, anyway - in just a week.
The video below runs through the creation process, and it's fascinating stuff. With the help of some nifty programs and an AI-powered texture upscaler, Reubs was able to get game's map up and running in Unreal 5, as well as Homer, a few NPCs, collectibles, and even vehicles. There's ray tracing for that fancy lighting, too, and of course the Duff Blimp flying overhead.

Perhaps the headline change is the removal of scaling. In the base Cyberpunk, V and their enemies gain stats as you level up. This means, without any upgrades, V ends up much weaker than enemies at the level 50 cap than they are at level one.

That is, it included DLSS support for Windows 10 (and, as a result, the Game Pass on PC version), as well as co-op, stability and mission fixes.
However, players have reported that this patch has negatively affected the cyberpunk-themed twin-stick shooter, including hits to framerate, stuttering and asset loading problems.

Announced back in 2014 for release on PS4, Wild was due to be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment with Rayman and Beyond Good & Evil creator Michel Ancel at the helm - until the famed designer announced his retirement from the games industry in 2020.
Wild only properly surfaced one more time following its announcement - at Paris Games Week in 2015 - and gameplay details remain limited to his day. We do know, however, that players, in the role of a shaman, could possess and play as a variety of wild animals - including a bear, eagle, and snake - and call on the help of deities as they explored the vast, prehistoric world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of cult classic adventure series Syberia can soon reunite with protagonist Kate Walker on a brand-new adventure - this one "across continents and through time periods" - when a fourth instalment, The World Before, comes to PC on 10th September.
The original Syberia, if you're unfamiliar, released all the way back in 2002, quickly charming adventure game fans with its gently surreal story of a New York lawyer dispatched to deal with the sale of a former automaton factory hidden in the French Alps.
An equally well-regarded sequel followed two years later, but it took a further 15 years for Walker's adventures to continue. Unfortunately, 2017's Syberia 3 was generally considered to be a bit of a dud - plagued by technical problems and flawed design - leaving many to assume its poor reception would mark the end of the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a little over two years since publisher THQ Nordic announced a new Saints Row title was "deep in development" at series studio Volition, and finally it seems the silence around the game is about to be broken, if a tantalising new tease is anything to go by.
The tease in question comes courtesy of noted presenter and producer Geoff Keighley, who shared some intriguing art on Twitter earlier today - featuring a heavily graffitied wall adorned with the word 'Rebooting' and, crucially, the Saints' beloved fleur-de-lis emblem.
The same image has now appeared on the official Saints Row Twitter feed and website - just in case their were any lingering doubts about its connection to the series - meaning the only real question left to ask at this juncture regarding what would be the first numbered Saints Row title to release since 2015 is, 'When will we learn more?'.

Spanish La Liga club Real Betis announced the signing of Argentinian defender Germán Pezzella with a video called GTA 4: Real Betis Edition.
In the video, striker Aitor Rubial walks to the club's stadium, the Estadio Benito Villamarín, with the camera aping the GTA perspective, and with a walk befitting Niko Bellic himself. The music is a good fit, and there's even a GTA-style user interface, complete with mini-map.

The video also runs through how Roblox, which has 200 million monthly users, encourages young game developers to work incredibly hard with unreasonable expectations of success.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a series first, the upcoming Halo Infinite has bots. And not just any bots - as I reported, Halo Infinite's bots aren't messing about.
Developer 343 used the recent Halo Infinite technical preview to gather feedback on bot behaviour and online performance. To that end, the technical preview debuted with the Bot Arena playlist, which put four players against four bots on arena maps.
As 343 pushed the bot difficulty lever over the course of the technical preview weekend, the AI became more deadly. These bots were accurate, aggressive and ruthless. They would come in for a well-timed melee hit after dropping your shield. They would dodge grenades. They used grenades well and often. They picked up power weapons and they were not afraid to use them.

The reveal isn't too much of a surprise - US retailer Best Buy successfully managed to leak the Doom Slayers Collection for Switch earlier today ahead of its official reveal - but the game's immediate post-announcement launch most certainly was, and Switch players can now enjoy some demon-hued FPS japes all in one bundle, featuring seminal 1993 original Doom, Doom 2, Doom 64, Doom 3, and 2016's sort-of-rebooted Doom.
Notably, that's one more game than was featured in the Doom Slayers Collection for Xbox and PlayStation, which released toward the end of last year minus Doom 64 - a pleasant treat for Switch owners, based on Digital Foundry's previous enthusiasm for the port.

Announced during QuakeCon's Skyrim panel, the Anniversary Edition arrives on 11th November - exactly ten years after the launch of the original version - and bundles together 2016's Skyrim Special Edition and a healthy chunk of additional content.
Specifically, it'll feature over 500 Creation Club elements - Creation Club being Bethesda's curated pool of officially sanctioned mods, which would usually need to be purchased with credits - including quests, dungeons, bosses, weapons, and spells.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking for a couple more video game freebies to shove unceremoniously into your almost certainly already overstuffed 'to do' pile, Epic has you covered, with Yooka-Laylee and Void Bastards currently free on its PC store.
Yooka-Laylee, if you're unfamiliar, is a spiritual successor to Rare's beloved platformer Banjo-Kazooie - and was developed by Playtonic, a studio founded by a number of ex-Rare veterans. Lizard and bat replace bear and bird in Yooka-Laylee, but the formula will be immediately familiar to Banjo-Kazooie fans, setting players loose across a number of sprawling, predominantly platforming-focussed worlds as they embark on an perky, old-school collectathon in search of missing Quills.
All in all, it's a decently entertaining adventure (although its superb side-scrolling sequel, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, is far superior), and one that Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a "sumptuous, diverting homage to a bygone era in game design that should keep fans of the old school hooked, even if it doesn't set the world on fire."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[id Software hasn't done an entirely great job of keeping its secrets secret ahead of this year's QuakeCon, but with this year's digital-only event now underway, those earlier leaks are starting to be officially confirmed, beginning with the rumoured new edition of seminal 1996 FPS shooter Quake - which turns out to be an enhanced remaster from Night Dive Studios, and is out now on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch.
Announced during Quakecon's opening livestream session (which saw id's Marty Stratton and Kevin Cloud, alongside Machine Games' Jerk Gustafsson, reflecting on Quake 25th anniversary), the newly enhanced version of Quake includes visual improvements, online and local split-screen multiplayer, plus a wealth of additional content.
Purchasers will receive the original Quake, its two official expansions - The Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity - plus two expansions created by Wolfenstein: The New Order developer Machine Games: Dimensions of the Past and the all-new Dimension of the Machine. Additionally, mods are supported on PC, while console player will be able to enjoy a selection of curated mods (as was the case for id's updated versions of Doom on consoles) at a later date.

        <link href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-ghost-of-tsushima-how-sony-tackled-the-cross-gen-save-problem"/>
        <updated>2021-08-19T12:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima has been given a proper PlayStation 5 upgrade, increasing resolution, decreasing loading times and removing pre-rendered cinematics for full real-time alternatives. It's a decent - though not exactly game-changing - upgrade, but what did catch our eye beyond this is how the new PS5 version imports any existing PlayStation 4 game saves you may have on your system. It's not a completely seamless experience, but the fact is that cross-save now works, allowing you to easily pick up on PS5 where you left off on PS4. 
The technical explanation for PlayStation 5's cross-save issues is fairly straightforward. Up until recently, the PS5 system software has no visibility or access to any PlayStation 4 data on your console, meaning that highly convoluted means were required to move progress from one generation to the next. Essentially, the PS4 version of the game had to be patched to allow game saves to be uploaded to the cloud. Moving over to PS5, the cloud data would then be downloaded and progress could continue. Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered are two good examples of this workaround in action. However, more recent titles including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and now Ghost of Tsushima have allowed for native import of PS4 games.
We had a look at Sony's SDK roadmap a while back and the concept of allowing PlayStation 5 titles to access PlayStation 4 user data was promised for a future update, which now appears to have rolled out. The first time I loaded Ghost of Tsushima, I disconnected my PS5 from the internet to rule out any potential cloud transfers, accessed the PS4 save game transfer option and discovered that all of my PS4 saves were available - the same saves I generated when I looked at the PS5 60fps patch for the game back in January. In turn, those saves were transferred across from my PS4 Pro using USB storage.

True Colours sees the Life is Strange series heading off to another picturesque corner of the United States - this time to a small Colorado town, Haven Springs, in the shadow of the Rockies - for a brand-new adventure featuring a predominantly new cast of characters.
Here, the focus is on new protagonist Alex Chen who, unusually for the series, has lived with her powers - enabling her to hear the thoughts of other characters, as well as view and experience their emotions - for some time prior to the start of the adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ignition Entertainment's cult classic action-adventure El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron finally has a PC release date and will be making its way to Steam on 2nd September.
El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron - which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, having originally launched for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011 - is perhaps the first and only game to be inspired by the apocryphal Book of Enoch.
It recounts the story of Enoch (re-imagined as blond, denim-clad pretty boy) as he hunts downs seven fallen angels at the behest of God - a quest that blends 3D and side-on platform segments with some deceptively simple, and thrillingly balletic, three-weapon combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oddworld: Soulstorm, the most recent entry in developer Oddworld Inhabitants' long-running adventure saga, is currently in the works for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.
Soulstorm - the direct sequel to 2014's Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty and a re-imagining of second series entry, 1998's Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus - initially released for PlayStation and PC back in April to somewhat mixed reviews.
Eurogamer's Christian Donlan, for instance, lamented the action-platformer's "unwelcome - and distinctly un-Oddworldly - scrappiness", which frequently manifested in a litany of unfortunate progress-thwarting bugs. "A shame, really, because once I got through that," he continued, "I was often swept along with the invention and vehemence and ugly beauty of what's on offer in an Oddworld game. At their best these games really do things no other games do."

Yesterday, Fortnite developer Epic announced a new game mode for its all-encompassing battle royale that has an uncanny resemblance to 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game Among Us.
Fortnite Impostors sees 10 players, eight agents and two impostors play out their roles on a submarine. Like in Among Us, the agents carry out routine assignments, while the impostors sabotage the facility and eliminate players. Impostors can also teleport players to cover their tracks and disable assignments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making games, we are often reminded, is hard, with development frequently being derailed by the most preposterously unpredictable things. Behold, for instance, the newly revealed story of Skyrim's iconic cart ride, and how it was, for a time before release, routinely thwarted by a particularly stubborn bee.
The full tale was recently recounted on Twitter by 14-year Bethesda veteran - and now solo indie developer - Nate Purkeypile, who served as senior world and lighting artist during the creation of Skyrim. "That intro is famous now," Purkeypile wrote, "but back then, it was just that one thing that we had to keep working and working on forever."
According to Purkeypile, the cart ride was particularly prone to mishaps during development because its bumps and bounces toward Helgen were physically simulated ("Why you ask?," he adds, "Good question.") - meaning environmental objects carelessly strewn about the place had a tendency to make the vehicle behave unpredictably, sometimes causing it to fly off the road. As the developer puts it, "The cart had a path it wanted to follow, but that doesn't mean it was a path it COULD follow."

This "definitive, modern edition" of Myst (not to be confused with the game's first fully 3D remake, realMyst, released back in the year 2000) debuted on the Oculus Store last December, significantly sprucing up the iconic islands first introduced to players back in 1993.
New art and sound are the most obvious improvements to the original game - alongside a photo mode to easily record clues and a randomised puzzle option for those seeking a greater challenge - but this latest version of Myst is also "built from the ground up" for VR.

        <link href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-08-17-cyberpunk-2077s-biggest-patch-to-date-includes-first-batch-of-post-launch-dlc-freebies"/>
        <updated>2021-08-17T18:24:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt is readying to release Cyberpunk 2077's "biggest patch to date" - the third major update since the RPG's disastrous launch last December - and has now shared full details of what it will bring, including an improved minimap and the game's first selection of free DLC.
Prior to Cyberpunk's launch, CD Projekt whipped up player interest with the promise of free post-launch DLC. However, plans for additional content were put on hold while the developer worked to fix the game's litany of bugs and to bring Cyberpunk's widely lambasted last-gen console release up to a more acceptable standard. Now though, according to senior quest designer Patrick Mills on tonight's 1.3 update dev stream, "streaming and memory management" have reached a point "where we can start trying to deliver those things".
As such, 1.3 includes the first of Cyberpunk 2077's free DLC, mostly falling into the category of 'minor cosmetic additions'. There are two new jackets - a red and shiny number, plus a grey and yellow option with a fur collar - alongside the Quartz Bandit: an orange and black car with its innards on the outside. The jackets and car are two separate rewards unlocked by completing small objectives received on reaching certain points in the game (anyone beyond those point will get the DLC on loading a save), and CD Projekt says future DLC drops will follow the same pattern of integration, with the goal being to make the world feel a little richer.

Fortnite Imposters sees 10 players, eight agents and two imposters play out their roles on a submarine. Like in Among Us, the agents carry out routine assignments, while the imposters sabotage the facility and eliminate players. Imposters can also teleport players to cover their tracks and disable assignments. 
Of course, it wouldn't be Fortnite without a few memes. For a short period‌, a "Peely Party" takes place where all agents and imposters look like Peely, an iconic character of judicial significance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A writer on Rainbow Six Siege has expressed their pride at the game's first transgender operator, who arrives with the Crystal Guard season update.
Narrative writer, Simon Ducharme, said they are "incredibly proud" of developing the character and had "tears of joy" knowing they were "encouraged and supported" to write queer characters.
Speaking to Gamespot, Ducharme added: "The decision to create a transgender character was made early on, as part of our initiative to have an inclusive roster of Operators. The consultants, all of whom are trans people, wanted to make sure that Osa was presented as authentically and organically as possible. She was written by a queer person and she is voiced by a trans woman - and while her identity is certainly influenced by her gender, who she is in the Siege universe is centered on her talents, her influence on Nighthaven, and her close friendship to Kali."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developer of Outriders has said Square Enix has yet to pay it a royalty fee, suggesting it has yet to break even.
In a financial statement, Polish company People Can Fly said that up to 16th August, it had not received royalties on the sale of the co-op-focused looter-shooter from publisher Square Enix.
Royalties would be paid to PCF if the net receipts from the sales of Outriders yielded the pre-agreed level of returns for Square Enix on the costs incurred relating to quality assurance, distribution and marketing. Essentially, the contract states PCF gets its royalties on profits only after Square Enix makes back its investment.

The DFEH filed its own lawsuit against Riot in February.

YouTuber Specilizer found multiplayer assets in the game that point to a large multiplayer map, which they speculate could be for a Factions battle royale mode given the size of the map. Considering the development period and release date of the game saw the explosive rise of battle royale games like Fortnite and PUBG, it makes sense Sony would have wanted to explore the genre with a first-party title.
Other assets include a "Listen-Mode-Device", which could potentially be the way to use listen mode in multiplayer. There are also backpack and armour models specifically for multiplayer.

But as Dead by Daylight starts its long goodbye to one franchise, it's preparing to say hello to another, with all signs pointing to the imminent arrival of Hellraiser in-game.
First introduced in September 2019, Dead by Daylight's Stranger Things collaboration ushered in two new survivors - Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler - alongside new killer The Demogorgon, and the Underground Complex Map.
For reasons unspecified (although almost certainly licensing-related), The Demogorgon, Nancy, and Steve - plus each characters' respective outfit cosmetics - will no longer be available for purchase in Dead by Daylight's store from 17th November.

Developed by Shantae studio WayForward and released in 2011, Betrayal marked a notable shift for the BloodRayne series, ditching the third-person action of previous instalments in order to send half-vampire protagonist Rayne on a side-scrolling hack-and-slash adventure through 15 monster-battering stages of spooky old castle.
For Betrayal's imminent remaster - officially known as BloodRayne Betrayal: Fresh Bites - WayForward and publisher Ziggurat Interactive are promising a range of improvements, including the addition of full voice acting to enliven the text-only original.

Announced to coincide with Doom's 25th anniversary in 2018 and released as a free megawad the following year, Sigil was designed as the unofficial fifth episode in the original Doom saga - picking up after Ultimate Doom's Thy Flesh Consumed - and treated fans to 18 brand-new, Romero-designed levels: nine single-player and nine death match.
Two years on from its release, Sigil was looking increasingly like a one-off experiment for Romero, but now - in a new video interview with Bridgeburner, lead developer on Doom total conversion The Age of Hell (skip to the 42-minute mark) - the designer has confirmed he's currently working on a sequel, this time utilising Doom 2.

Sakura's face as it appears on the Street Fighter 5 character select screen has been a point of contention ever since she was added to the fighting game in January 2018, with some criticising her "bug eyes" and "alien" look.
The update changes Sakura's character select stance, and so we see her face from a slightly different angle and with different lighting. This makes all the difference, and her face on character select now doesn't have that bug-like alien look.

Kubernetes v1.22 introduced a new alpha feature for clusters that
include Windows nodes: HostProcess containers.
HostProcess containers aim to extend the Windows container model to enable a wider
range of Kubernetes cluster management scenarios. HostProcess containers run
directly on the host and maintain behavior and access similar to that of a regular
process. With HostProcess containers, users can package and distribute management
operations and functionalities that require host access while retaining versioning
and deployment methods provided by containers. This allows Windows containers to
be used for a variety of device plugin, storage, and networking management scenarios
in Kubernetes. With this comes the enablement of host network mode—allowing

"I think what's really fun about the sheer amount of Marvel villains on our roster is we get to really dig into what would be the most interesting twist and turn from what we've done previously," writer Hannah MacLeod told GameInformer (thanks, TheGamer).
"Crossbones has some of the most iconic comic dialogue ever because he just enjoys himself so much, but he's also got some interesting tricks up his sleeve. There's always a lot of discussion of who we think our villains should be. Klaue doesn't really get his hands dirty in the same way as other villains might, so we needed him to have a character who would have no problem with that."

Halo Infinite developer, 343 Industries, confirmed assassinations will not be available in the sci-fi shooter during a livestream back at the end of July. However, the recent test flight has seen interest in the notably absent franchise tradition resurface online.
Assassinations - animations that are triggered when you creep up on an enemy player and melee them from behind - have long been a Halo staple. But despite the team at 343i "really lov[ing] assassinations", they've been removed because of the "gameplay disadvantage" to pulling one off.

The bug - which has since been resolved - would permit players with "amount100" in their Steam account email address to intercept payments made via Smart2Pay and artificially inflate them (thanks, NME).
After detailing how the exploit could be generated, Valve's JonP promptly thanked drbrix and agreed the team at Valve had been able to "validate this is happening pretty much as described", and were taking steps to address it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boyfriend Dungeon developer Kitfox has agreed to update its content warning following feedback from players.
Though the current statement warns that users should "play with care" given the game "may include references to unwanted advances, stalking, and other forms of emotional manipulation", the mature themes have prompted Kitfox to update the warning and make it "more accurate" in an update next week.
"The content warning for Boyfriend Dungeon inadequately describes the events of stalking and emotional manipulation that exist in the story," the developer said in a statement on Twitter (thanks, PC Gamer). "We'll update the game next week with a more accurate CW. We apologise for any hurt inflicted by our mistake. Thank you for playing!"

The news helps explain Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive's recent GTA mod takedown spree - particular mods that recreated the games in question.

Battlefield 2042's closed playtest kicked off on Thursday with PC, and has now brought Xbox into the fold (the planned PlayStation test was cancelled at the last minute due to a "critical issue"). Predictably, gameplay footage leaked online, which EA yesterday scrambled to pull offline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar is reportedly putting the finishing touches to remasters of its open-world PlayStation 2-era classics Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas for release later this year.
Rumours of possible remasters for the games first bubbled up over the summer as fans began wondering why Take-Two's lawyers had suddenly started issuing a raft of takedown notices for classic GTA mods. Speculation grew further following Take-Two's recent confirmation it had three unannounced "new iterations of previously released titles" in the works.
Now, however, an investigation by Kotaku has revealed more tangible details, with its sources - who, the website says, have a proven track record providing accurate information on GTA Online and Red Dead Online - claiming Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas are indeed getting the remaster treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cory Davis, creative director and designer on Spec Ops: The Line, and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck have joined forces to establish a new game studio, Eyes Out.
Based in Los Angeles, Eyes Out is said to consist of a team of "passionate world-builders and storytellers who believe in the powerful synesthesia that emerges from music, narrative, and interactive experiences". Work on the studio's first project is currently underway, and while specifics are limited, it's described as a "single-player immersive cosmic horror game with strong environmental storytelling elements."
The project won't be Davis' first tangle with the horror genre; while cult favourite 2012 shooter Spec Ops: The Line is perhaps his most discussed work, Davis' packed resume also features level design credits on the horror-heavy Condemned 2: Bloodshot and F.E.A.R: Extraction Point, and he served as director on 2016's surreal PSVR horror title Here They Lie.

Lone Echo 2 catapults protagonists Captain Olivia Rhodes and player-controlled android Echo One (nicknamed "Jack") 400 years into the future, where an abandoned space station holds the key to returning home. Pre-release glimpses suggest it'll deliver another bout of moody sci-fi adventure built around zero-gravity traversal and puzzling, with Ready at Dawn promising "complex challenges" and "startling discoveries" as its "emotional" far-future story unfolds.
Lone Echo 2 was originally announced all the way back in 2018 for a release the following year, but the game has see multiple delays along the way - the most recent due to development challenges involving the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. And now Ready at Dawn has confirmed it'll be pushing launch back once more in a post to its blog.

Frostpunk 2 is the first of three current in-house projects to be formally revealed by 11-Bit Studios, and given the success of the first game, perhaps this one doesn't come as much of a surprise. A brief announcement trailer has been released, showing that the world of Frostpunk has moved on from coal to oil - although it looks just as brutal as before.  
"In Frostpunk's successor, players are once again tasked with playing as the leader of a resource-hungry metropolis where the expansion and search for new sources of power is an unavoidable reality. But the apocalyptic world has moved on," says the press release. "After the age of coal, conquering Frostland for the oil extraction industry is expected to be the new salvation of what's left of humanity. However, change does not come easily, and not everyone in this new multi-layered society will welcome this new direction."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA and DICE have released a short film that gives us a short look at the world of Battlefield 2042. 
"Exodus" introduces the No-Pats, a multinational armed militia that is engaged in a civil war over the future of the group. The film also confirms that the other main factions of the game will be the United States and Russia. 
Both states are on the brink of war as the world struggles over resources and surrounding nations have collapsed, while the group of nomads from collapsed nations known as the Non-Patriated ("No-Pats") appear to have bound together for survival.

No injuries have been reported.
The Goomba statue broke free from its normal position atop the Yoshi's Adventure ride, Asahi Shumbun Digital reported (thanks, VGC). The Goombas fell just next to the ride's track, close to where a Yoshi car was passing by, but not directly onto anywhere guests could have been.

        <updated>2021-08-12T13:08:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in January, we got a pretty extensive look at the remastered environments and quests being made for Skyblivion - a mod project seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine. The team behind this ambitious project has continued making progress, and the latest mod development video focuses on some of the stunning landscapes that are now nearing completion. 
According to the new video, the majority of Skyblivion's map is now in the final stages of development, and the work shown so far is seriously impressive. The video discusses how areas such as the forest surrounding the Orange Road have been adapted and improved for the remake. The team decided to make the forest "more lush and detailed than its original counterpart" and make it larger to give it a more prominent role in the game, citing the area's ambience and popularity with players as the reason for giving it more attention. 
Blackwood, meanwhile, has been given more fortifications and border gates to add points of interest. The new boggy marsh at the centre of Blackwood, called Blackmarch, looks suitably horrifying and spooky - promising players a subregion full of ruins and decay. The city of Leyawiin has been redesigned from the ground up "referencing concept art from Oblivion that was likely discarded owing to technical and time limitations", with the city divided into three distinct sections. Boats are now able to sail right through the city, allowing them to go further inland.

Klein has apologised "unreservedly" for the sexist and racist language in the posts, which he says were written in 2007.
"I was recently confronted with some awful statements made on a blog I wrote back in 2007," Klein wrote on Twitter a couple of weeks ago. "I take full ownership for the things I said, and I'm embarrassed, sad, and angry at my younger self for saying this stuff. I hope it is obvious that I don't believe these things anymore."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boyfriend Dungeon, the long-awaited weapon-romancing dungeon-crawler from developer Kitfox Games, is finally here on PC, Xbox, Switch, and Game Pass.
If Boyfriend Dungeon seems like a name that's been knocking around for a while, you'd be right; it was initially announced back in 2017, and successfully raised $272,000 in Kickstarter crowdfunding a year later. Since then, Kitfox has been hard at work on its genre-mash-up oddity - lovingly referred to as a "shack-and-slash" - that's part dungeon-crawler  (complete with procedurally generated maps and varied combat styles) and part dating sim.
"You move into your cousin's old apartment, rent-free for the summer," Kitfox explains in a bout of scene-setting. "To get some confidence and meet people, plus earn a little cash, you're tasked with clearing the creatures in 'the dunj'. Soon you discover weapons [that] transform into cuties... and they're SINGLE!... But someone's abducting weapons and leaving them damaged in the dungeon! Who could do such a thing? Will you solve the blade-napping mystery? Will you find love? Or, friendship, at least?".

Wyoming will be the eighth world-expanding DLC to release for American Truck Simulator since its launch back in 2016 (following on from Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, and last year's Colorado), bringing its state count up to a total of ten once the base game's California and Nebraska are factored in - meaning SCS Software will officially be one fifth of the way through its recreation the US on Wyoming's arrival.
"Wyoming may be one of the least populated states in the US," SCS explained previously, "but that doesn't mean that it lacks spectacular places to visit and see. Home to some of the country's most breathtaking national parks, Wyoming is best known for its red-walled gorges, hot springs, historic prairie towns, pioneer history, and historical attractions."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was a busy old Indie World showcase this evening, with Nintendo serving up another brisk - but extremely eventful - look at some of the new titles heading to Switch between right now and into next year. Headliners included surprise launches for Axiom Verge 2 and Boyfriend Dungeon, not to mention an upcoming release for the superb Tetris Effect: Connected, but if you missed the show and want a convenient catch-up, you'll find everything announced below.
Necrobarista: Final Pour, an enhanced version of the acclaimed visual-novel-style adventure from Route 59, is launching as a timed console exclusive on Switch today. Once again, the stylishly told story focusses on a magical Melbourne cafe where the dead are granted one last night to mingle with the living, but Final Pour introduces new narrative content, remastered visuals, plus a new Studios mode, where players can create their own dialogue and stories.
Necrobarista isn't the only game launching on Switch, however; head to the eShop right now and you'll find Axiom Verge 2, the long-awaited follow-up to developer Thomas Happ's acclaimed 2015 retro-styled Metroid-a-like, as well as vibrant life-sim-style adventure Garden Story - a timed console exclusive on Switch that charts a sentient grape's attempts to fend of the omnipresent Rot and help rejuvenate an island and its inhabitants.

The original Tetris Effect, created by legendary game designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi (known for the likes of Rez, Lumines, and Space Channel 5), was, of course, very good indeed, transforming the classic puzzler into a mesmerising audio-visual treat. We even called it our Game of the Year when it released in 2018 (and one of our Games of the Decade in 2019.
Last year's Tetris Effect: Connected update expanded on the superb single-player original with a range of new online and local multiplayer modes (both co-op and competitive), and it's this version - also featuring cross-platform online support - that'll be released on Switch in October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Niantic, developer of Pokémon Go, has laid out its long-term plan for a "real-world" metaverse based on our global reality - rather than an entirely virtual one of the kind seen in Ready Player One.
In an extended blog post titled "The Metaverse is a Dystopian Nightmare, Let's Build a Better Reality", company founder John Hanke has discussed his vision for how technology can be harnessed to build a better version of our world which strengthens in-person interactions - while criticising the idea of technology designed to abandon our reality and instead play inside a computer simulation.
This is all long-term future stuff, so there's no direct reference to Pokémon Go's ongoing big debate around pandemic interaction distance changes. (It also arrives alongside news of another Niantic company acquisition - this time of fancy 3D scanning app Scaniverse.) But there are certainly comments here which reinforce Niantic's long-term ethos for its games - and Pokémon Go in particular - which touch on issues raised in that debate, and perhaps further illuminate Niantic's own position in it.

Anyone who's played a Halo game online will probably have been teabagged. For the uninitiated, it involves repeatedly pressing the crouch button so your Spartan character squats up and down on your enemy's corpse.
Halo players have been teabagging each other since Halo: Combat Evolved came out in 2001, to rub it in, to frustrate and annoy. In the online world of Halo, teabagging is very much human behaviour.

We see detailed character models, environments and even objects in shops (The Ascent's shops are great!). I love the Neuromancer nod, too.
Griff Griffin used a tool called the Universal Unreal Engine 4 Unlocker to move the camera about (details are in the video description). It's a great thing, too because we see The Ascent's compelling cyberpunk world holds up under close scrutiny. That developer Neon Giant is a studio of just 12 people makes this all the more impressive.

The blog post explains some of the internals of the Memory manager, a beta feature
of Kubernetes 1.22. In Kubernetes, the Memory Manager is a
kubelet subcomponent.
The memory manage provides guaranteed memory (and hugepages)
allocation for pods in the Guaranteed QoS class.
This blog post covers:
Why do you need it?
The internal details of how the MemoryManager works
Current limitations of the MemoryManager
Future work for the MemoryManager
Why do you need it?
Some Kubernetes workloads run on nodes with
non-uniform memory access (NUMA).
Suppose you have NUMA nodes in your cluster. In that case, you'll know about the potential for extra latency when
compute resources need to access memory on the different NUMA locality.

Knuckles' inclusion in the second Sonic movie seemed almost certain after fans spotted a stand-in prop of the echidna (alongside similar ones for Sonic and Tails) on-set back in April, and we've now been given a first official tease of the character's movie look on Twitter.
The image - a close-up of Knuckles' knuckles, naturally - was shared by Idris Elba on social media following confirmation that the actor (most recently seen in James Gunn's The Suicide Squad) would be voicing the character in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, which is scheduled to arrive in cinemas on 8th April 2022 if all goes well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its decidedly leisurely ID@Xbox indie showcase this evening, Microsoft confirmed another batch of titles heading to Game Pass between now and some currently unspecified future point, including Stardew Valley and nefarious management sequel Evil Genius 2.
Stardew Valley developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone popped up midway through tonight's showcase for a bit of a natter, confirming toward the end of the segment that his much-loved village life sim would be heading to Game Pass for PC and Xbox some time this autumn.
Also still awaiting a Game Pass arrival date is the adorable Pupperazzi, a first-person photography game that - as you may have already surmised from its title - tasks players with taking cute snaps of (and petting!) canines as they go about their doggy lives in a colourful holiday paradise. As with most of the below, details on specific Game Pass platforms weren't shared during the show, but I'll update the story if any clarification is forthcoming.

PUBG: Battlegrounds' Free Play Week is now underway on Steam, giving interested parties to chance to play all available modes and maps until next Monday, 16th August. That, of course, includes PUBG's new Taego map, whisking players players back to 1980s South Korea. 
Taego - PUBG's first 8x8km map since 2017's Miramar - is notable for a number of key new features, including self-revive and the new Gulag-esque Comeback BR mechanic. The latter gives players that die prior to the first Blue Zone the chance to respawn if they can survive against other players in a separate Comeback Arena.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Fortress 2, it's fair to say, is getting on a bit. The 14-year-old game remains incredibly popular on Steam, but over the past year it's hit the headlines for the wrong reasons, with bot problems that show no sign of disappearing. (Although we got to witness players conga-ing their way past the bots, at least.) 
In any case, it seems the community has finally taken it upon themselves to give Team Fortress 2 a refresh, as a group of modders called Amper Software has started recreating the game in Garry's Mod spiritual successor s&box. The reason for this: they wondered what Team Fortress 2 would look like in Valve's newest engine, Source 2. 
"Ever since Source 2 was first mentioned publicly as an engine that Valve was working on, a lot of people in the Team Fortress 2 community have started asking the question: if Valve ever ports TF2 to Source 2, what would it look like? How different gameplay would be? And would TF2 even feel the same?," the team explained in a blog post. "...s&box, the spiritual successor of Garry's Mod made on the Source 2 engine, has been released as part of a dev preview to a group of community members, including ourselves. It, pretty much, like Garry's Mod itself, allows you to build whatever you want using the toolset that it provides. So we've decided to not lose that chance."

Celebrations have been a long-standing conduit for toxic behaviour in competitive FIFA. Your opponent is forced to watch them - and they can be pretty grating after rage-inducing goals are scored.
With FIFA 21, EA pulled the Shush and A-OK celebrations from the game. The Shush celebration in particular was infamous within the community as it was done while the scoring player was running. (Players sometimes use running celebrations to extend the celebration time as they jog up and down the pitch - a frustrating time-wasting tactic.)

Using post-processing injector Reshade, Digital Dreams was able to create a ray-tracing preset for the game and manipulate the colour hue to give it an added sparkle. Depth of field has also been retouched and greater draw distances have been added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iron Gate has served up a few more morsels of information about upcoming Valheim update Hearth and Home, and this time, it's all about changes to the game's food system. The way snacking works is being given an overhaul - and it looks like some food items are getting a nerf in the process. Ah crumbs. 
In the game's current form, simply shoving some food in your mouth will result in (somewhat) even amounts of health and stamina, but the system arriving in Hearth and Home will change that. Food will soon be divided into three categories: items that provide more health, items that provide more stamina, and items that provide an even split. As explained in the video below, that means you can bulk up on meat and HP before a big battle - or slurp down a stew to increase your stamina for an afternoon of building. 
The different categories will be marked by a coloured fork icon, with red indicating a focus on health, yellow for stamina, and white for a balanced meal. The food bar is also being replaced by a timer system to indicate how long the foods will last.

As you would expect from a mod menu, Ozark lets modders manipulate the game, both in the campaign and online, to their liking, allowing them to teleport, instakill, spawn vehicles, drop money, and more. 
While modding single player games has some legal ambiguity (Take-Two also seems determined to make all forms of modding illegal), modding multiplayer sessions is detrimental to the experience of other players.

Similar to the C64 Mini - which Retro Games Ltd also produced - this is a reimagining of the 16-bit Commodore personal computer, touting emulation of the original A500 chipset and the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) of later Amiga model the A1200.
The A500 Mini comes with both a mouse and gamepad, as well as support for a plugging in a standard keyboard over USB, since we imagine the keys on the mini system itself are too dinky to use.

There's admittedly not a whole lot to report on the new arena yet - although you can get a long-distance glimpse below - but there're a few more details to share ahead of Season 4. Come Wednesday's launch, for instance, Rocket League players will be able to enjoy expanded competitive tournaments including Extra and 2v2, with the latter appearing in the first of Season 4's limited-time modes: 2v2 Heatseeker.
This gets underway on 12th August and will be followed by Speed Demon - a "super-fast LTM [combining] mutators, the speed of Boomer Ball without the wild bounces, demos on contact, and a fast respawn timer" - and then Spring Loaded due later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5, the latest instalment in Playground Games' sublime open-world racing series is a few short months away from release, and with the hype handle now beginning to crank in earnest, the developer has offered a first look at the game's sprawling Mexico-themed map.
You can see the map, with its tantalising tangle of roadways and landmarks below, but Playground has also given a bit of a guided tour in its latest video (start at the 27-minute mark).
As creative director Mike Brown reiterates, Forza Horizon 5's map will be 50% bigger than that of its UK-set predecessor, providing ample room for its previously announced 11 biomes, which include tropical and rocky coastlines, living and sandy deserts, winding canyons, arid hills, lush farmland, river-strewn jungles, swampland, and the vibrant city streets of Guanajuato - all beneath the gargantuan volcano that lies at the centre of the map.

I Am Dead, which is published by Annapurna Interactive, casts players as recently deceased museum curator Morris Lupton, who, with a little help from his equally non-corporeal dog Sparky, must save his tiny island home of Shelmerston from volcanic destruction.
It's a thoroughly endearing adventure that plays out a little like a supernatural find-the-object game as players investigate the islanders' memories and use Morris' ghostly vision to twirl, slice, and probe the beautiful diorama-style innards of objects around him.

Overcooked, which tasks players with working together to frantically assemble meals and fulfil customer orders within a time limit (while also trying to navigate the peculiarities of some wildly impractical kitchens at the same time), initially launched on 3rd August 2016 - and has been causing heated arguments with loved-ones ever since.
On the game's actual fifth birthday last Monday, Ghost Town announced it would be releasing some free anniversary treats for owners of Overcooked: All You Can Eat (the recently released remaster bundle of Overcooked 1, 2, and its DLC) and the update has now arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

Director of communications Ryan K. Rigney explained in a Reddit AMA that the feature was "gnarly as hell in terms of being a problem to solve," citing technical and logistical difficulties as being two reasons for the long wait. 
"It's not only that you have to solve the technical challenge of merging existing accounts, but there are also legal and contractual issues to navigate with purchasing on other platforms," he explained. "Different regions have different laws. It's a mess. But we're working on it, and we're committed to delivering it."

Fortnite gets a namecheck in the explainer video below, hosted by the BBC's Dan Walker and Sam Quek, as it's revealed how everything except the presenters' chairs and table was a creation of Unreal Engine. 
Unreal Engine is commonly used in film and TV production either to create virtual studios or surroundings, or to mock up in real-time how an effects-based shot might look with live-action actors in frame.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Man's Sky is celebrating five (extremely eventful) years since launch today, and developer Hello Games has served up a tiny tease for the exploratory space sim's next big update, Frontiers, as part of the festivities.
While No Man's Sky soothing exploratory rhythm certainly found its fans at launch on 9th August 2016, its arrival was infamously marked by immediate and sustained controversy when players discovered some of the features discussed prior to its release were absent from the final game. Hello Games has embarked on a truly staggering post-launch development journey since then, and has now put out a total of 16 named - and in some cases utterly transformative - updates for the ever-expanding space sim.
We've seen the introduction of base building, bobbleheads, farming, cross-platform multiplayer, VR support, giant customisable space freighters, land and water vehicles, pilotable mechs, living ships, alien-infested space derelicts, new flora and fauna, pets, live-service-style community expeditions, music tools, major overhauls to the game's planetary generation tech, spicy visual enhancements for new-gen consoles, sand worms (finally!), and more.

Back 4 Blood does have a versus mode, allowing two teams to take it in turns to fight each other as the Cleaners and the Ridden. But there is no campaign level akin to Left 4 Dead, where players would have to fight through player-controlled zombies to get to the safe house.

In 2008, with Duke Nukem Forever in development hell, artist Gregor Punchatz headed up a Gearbox-commissioned project at Dallas, Texas-based production studio Janimation to create an animated vertical slice to show what Duke Nukem Begins was meant to be.
The video shows third-person shooting, with Duke killing various demons using familiar weapons in an urban setting. We also see four-player co-op. There's a big boss fight at the end, with Duke flying around using a jet-pack. Yes, that's Guerrilla Radio by Rage Against the Machine.

The stable version of CSI Proxy for Windows has been released alongside Kubernetes 1.22.  CSI Proxy enables CSI Drivers running on Windows nodes to perform privileged storage operations.
Background
Container Storage Interface (CSI) for Kubernetes went GA in the Kubernetes 1.13 release. CSI has become the standard for exposing block and file storage to containerized workloads on Container Orchestration systems (COs) like Kubernetes. It enables third-party storage providers to write and deploy plugins without the need to alter the core Kubernetes codebase. Legacy in-tree drivers are deprecated and new storage features are introduced in CSI, therefore it is important to get CSI Drivers to work on Windows.

The 1.22 release introduced alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for
Kubernetes workloads on a per-node basis.
In prior releases, Kubernetes did not support the use of swap memory on Linux,
as it is difficult to provide guarantees and account for pod memory utilization
when swap is involved. As part of Kubernetes' earlier design, swap support was
considered out of scope, and a kubelet would by default fail to start if swap
was detected on a node.

According to Bloomberg, a recent deal struck between South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and ViacomCBS - allegedly valued at around $900 million (£648m) over six years - seals several new series and "spinoff movies" for streaming service, Paramount+.
The story also references a new "3D video game that is set in the world of South Park", which will seemingly be developed not in collaboration with Ubisoft or its partners this time, but is instead underway at an "in-house studio".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kerbal Space Program studio Squad has finally brought development of its acclaimed space flight sim to a close, over a decade after the game's first public release.
Kerbal Space Program - which initially launched into early access via Squad's website in 2011 - gives players the opportunity to build and pilot their own fully-functional spaceships, rockets, and vehicles (while managing all aspects their alien race's quest for the stars if they choose), using actual proper science-y systems, from realistic aerodynamic to orbital physics.
Since leaving early access back in 2015, Kerbal Space Program has remained in active development, receiving numerous updates and expansions along the way - there's even a free "next-gen" update for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S due this autumn. However, Squad has now confirmed - after warning players the space flight sim's 1.12 update would be its last major release back in June - that its decade-plus-long journey is officially at an end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This month's Rust update truly is a whopper, introducing a refreshed underwater biome with procedural underwater lab dungeons, submarines, torpedoes, sharks and more. 
The update, which launched yesterday, introduces procedurally-generated underwater labs to the world of Rust, which will come in a variety of shapes and sizes - but always with two entry points. They can be entered via a "moonpool" using a submarine (another new item that we'll get to later). The labs also have CCTV to help you plan your route, along with microphones that let you "broadcast your commands into the entire base's network". 
Some labs even come with mess hall rooms that allow you to play high-stakes poker, or barbecue meat while listening to music with your pals. That all sounds relaxing, but there are also plenty of nefarious NPCs on board that want to spoil your day - best stay on your toes. You'll find some tasty loot if you make it past these puzzles and enemies, so perhaps the reward is worth the risk.

But players quickly found the emote was a bit too friendly. Epic Games has now removed the emote from sale.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> A master face is a face image that passes face-based identity-authentication for a large portion of the population. These faces can be used to impersonate, with a high probability of success, any user, without having access to any user-information. We optimize these faces, by using an evolutionary algorithm in the latent embedding space of the StyleGAN face generator. Multiple evolutionary strategies are compared, and we propose a novel approach that employs a neural network in order to direct the search in the direction of promising samples, without adding fitness evaluations. The results we present demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a high coverage of the population (over 40%) with less than 10 master faces, for three leading deep face recognition systems...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

As you can see in the video below, the Shamblers' bums were bright and appeared to explode and exert a gaseous acid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saber Interactive's Evil Dead game will no longer release this year as originally planned, and is now targeting a PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC launch in February 2022.
Evil Dead: The Game casts players as familiar faces from all across the Evil Dead franchise, bringing them together in co-operative union to battle the forces of darkness - chainsaws (and other assorted melee and ranged weapons) in hand. Adding an extra wrinkle to the core co-op action is a PvP component in which another player becomes the Kandarian Demon itself, able to roam the map in a bid to thwart the humans' plans.
According to the gameplay trailer released earlier this year, human players will need hunt down pages of the Necronomicon, Raymond Knowby's tapes, and other artefacts in order to cast the spell needed to vanquish the demon and win a match, all of which sounds very much in the Dead by Daylight/Friday the 13th: The Game mold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's been having a bit of an indie shindig over on the PlayStation Blog, ushering in seven announcements and reveals that might just leave PS4 and PS5 owners slightly aquiver. And if you missed them, you'll find everything gathered up into one convenient digest below.
Adam Robinson-Yu's much-loved open-world exploration game A Short Hike, in which a small bird goes on a brief but thoroughly delightful mountain-climbing adventure, is coming to PlayStation consoles some time this autumn. We liked this one a lot when it released for PC back in 2019 - Christian Donlan called it "dreamy brilliance" in his Essential review - so it's definitely one to keep an eye out for.
Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, the sequel to developer Night School Studio's deliciously eerie 2016 narrative adventure, is also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation consoles. It's set to feature an "entirely new" cast of characters - players control Riley Poverly as she investigates strange electromagnetic signals in her home town of Camena - while retaining, as Night School puts  it, "the weird, heartfelt, and personalised experience of the original". Previous word suggested Oxenfree 2 will launch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's "mass multiplayer outdoor extreme sports game" Riders Republic will begin its previously announced beta later this month on 23rd August.
Riders Republic is something of a spiritual successor to Ubisoft's under-appreciated winter sports effort Steep, but while that game focussed exclusively on snowy pursuits, Riders Republic encompasses a broader range of activities, including biking and wing suit action (both vanilla and jet-powered) alongside skiing and snowboarding.
Players can experience Riders Republic's world - which is stitched together from seven iconic US national parks: Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Grand Teton, Mammoth Mountain, Sequoia Park, Yosemite Valley, and Zion - both solo and co-operatively. However, Ubisoft is heavily pushing the game's large-scale competitions, which include races with upward of 50 players.

Influencers, YouTubers and community leaders have today used their sizable social media footprints to all share an open letter to Niantic setting out the reasons why they believe the game's extended interaction distance should remain, several days after it was reverted in the US and New Zealand. 
The list of reasons includes being able to play while further socially distanced, and keeping the game extra accessible for less able players. Other reasons listed include being able to play further away from the general public for personal safety reasons, and further away from businesses or landmarks to avoid congestion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a new Apex Legend in town, but Seer might be bringing a little too much firepower to the table - as Apex Legends players are complaining that his abilities are too powerful. Some are even comparing his abilities to "wallhacks", and many are calling for the character to be nerfed. 
Over on the Apex Legends subreddit, complaints are piling in about how Seer's abilities stack up to give him too much of an advantage in combat. Many of these complaints are centred on Seer's microdrones - and the fact they're seemingly the Swiss army knife of Legend abilities. Not only does the tactical ability do damage, it also reveals enemy locations (including health bars) and interrupts actions such as healing.
While Seer's tactical does take some time to travel, players have found that it has a surprisingly large hitbox, as you can see from the experiment below... and the poor soul hiding inside a building who got caught out by the ability. It's also a seemingly unstoppable force that can go through mountains.

The change is part of a wider programme to introduce local pricing relative to the cost of living and exchange rates in every region.  
Under the existing pricing structure, UK subscribers were paying approximately $7 USD per sub, significantly higher than the $4.99 paid by Americans. The new price is therefore much fairer to subscribers outside the United States.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bold move that certainly didn't pay off, a pair of PlayStation 5 development kits appeared on eBay yesterday - although the listings didn't last more than a few hours before being removed. 
As spotted by Twitter user iDCx1337, the listings were for a DFI-D1000AA dev kit and a DFI-T1000AA test kit (thanks, Kotaku). A screenshot of the DFI-D1000AA dev kit, complete with two all-black DualSense controllers, showed that the listing apparently reached a bidding price of €2850 (£2423) before being pulled.   
It remains unclear whether eBay decided to remove the listings or whether Sony got involved, but either way, the listings apparently only survived a few hours before they mysteriously vanished. We still don't know how the seller got their hands on these kits: dev kits are normally given out to developers under strict NDA. It seems these two have somehow managed to trickle down into the hands of someone who was willing to take a punt on an eBay listing.

Fullbright officially announced the change last night, ahead of a Polygon report which detailed an exodus of staff at the company "at least in part due to Gaynor's behaviour toward workers". 
Gaynor will remain a writer on Open Roads, the upcoming Annapurna-published story of a mother and daughter, which will now no longer be released in 2021.

While Fall Guys' fifth, jungled-themed season continues to be the main event, players currently have the option to tumble back to where it all began with the special Anniversary Party show, featuring the game's original roster of rounds.
And for those wanting to dress for the occasion, Mediatonic has added two birthday cosmetics to the in-game store - a special body suit, emblazoned with cakes, balloons, and the like, plus a fetching birthday crown. They can be purchased for a meagre 10 Kudos each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon's massively multiplayer online title New World has been delayed again but this time only by around a month, with the game now expected to launch on PC on 28th September.
Announcing New World's fourth delay in a statement posted to Twitter, Amazon Game Studios wrote, "We are humbled by the support New World received from players around the world throughout closed beta. During beta, more than a million adventurers played more than 16 million total hours... The passion and enthusiasm you've shown for New World validates the work we've put in over the past year, improving the game based on your feedback". 
"We want New World's launch to be a smooth and fun experience for all players," the studio continued, "and that means making some improvements based on what you encountered during closed beta. So we're going to take a few extra weeks to smash bugs, improve stability, and polish the game." This, it says, means a new global launch date of 28th September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Games shows might be lacking some of their old-time bombast since the pandemic forced a shift to digital-only presentations, but there's no denying the continuing thrill of a flashy announcement show. And we now have firm details of the next biggie as Geoff Keighley prepares his Keighleymobile and readies to ride out for Gamescom's Opening Night Live.
This year's Opening Night Live marks the third annual outing for the show since its debut back in 2019, and the second time it'll be taking the form of a digital-only event. It'll be held on Wednesday 25th August, slightly later than previously announced, and we now know exactly when we'll be expected to grasp snacks and take our seats as things get underway.
As confirmed by Keighley, who'll once again be presenting, over on Twitter, the 2021 showcase will run for two hours, with proceedings kicking off at an entirely reasonable 7pm in the UK/11am PT. There's no mention of a pre-show yet, but last year's started half an hour before the main event, so if you just can't resist a good old-fashioned pre-ample, you might want to block out a bit more time in your diary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever heard of Blackpink? If not, well, a lot of people sure have - the band was the first K-pop girl group to reach 1bn views on YouTube, and they're currently the most subscribed-to music group on the platform (via Vogue UK). And now the group is coming to PUBG with their very own crossover event. 
Between 18th August to 7th September players will be able to participate in "special in-game event missions" to earn points to acquire Blackpink-themed items, including a level three helmet and contraband coupons. And there's plenty more in-game items where that came from: 35 distinct items will be on sale in total, and will be purchasable from today until the end of the year. Each of the band members will have their own cosmetic bundles (each of which includes "themed hair, an outfit, a nameplate, helmet, weapon and emote"). 
PUBG's maps will also see some changes as part of the event. Blackpink-themed decorations such as building decals, plane banners, supply crates and level three helmets will appear from today until 7th September on PC, and from 12th August to 15th September on consoles.

        <updated>2021-08-04T14:06:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the vanilla version of Cyberpunk 2077, you may find yourself wearing some absurd clothing combinations just for the sake of your armour stat. Bucket hats and high heels, biking boots and pencil skirts - it all goes on just to increase that number. What you wear in Night City doesn't have much of an impact on your interactions with others, but one modder has introduced a system to make clothes more meaningful.  
StreetStyle - Immersive Fashion System adds more depth to Cyberpunk's existing clothing system by tying your outfits to the game's skill checks. The PC mod gives each item of clothing specific skill bonuses in Strength, Reflexes, Technical, Intelligence and Cool (with a value between one and five for each category). These combine with your base stats to give you skill boosts that comes in handy for skill checks - such as those found in dialogue and device interactions. Items have been assigned stats according to their actual purpose: wearing Netrunning equipment, for instance, will boost your Intelligence stat - but it won't provide much help with Strength and Reflexes, as the suits are not designed for combat.   
You can't simply boost your stats into the stratosphere, too: StreetStyle also adjusts the difficulty of skill checks to prevent them from being too easy with the buffs. The mod calculates your clothing bonus by adding up the total of all your clothing items for a single attribute, then dividing that number by seven, and adding it to your base stat.

Yesterday, as Activision Blizzard executives such as boss Bobby Kotick insisted "we will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry" during a financial call aimed at the investor community, a coalition of workers from across multiple Activision Blizzard studios criticised the decision to hire WilmerHale, the same law firm helping Amazon keep its workers from unionising, to review the company.
As reported by IGN, the employees, collectively called the ABK Workers Alliance, said Kotick did not "meaningfully address" workers' demands following last week's high-profile employee walkout.

As reported by Kotaku, the update's new reputation system has a huge rank cap of 1000 and reaching the higher levels takes a lot of time. The only way to earn RP is through Tuner races, testing out new cards, and passively by walking around the car meet. 
Players have figured out the passive RP method can be exploited easily. As long as they can keep their character moving around in the car meet, they won't be booted from a server for inactivity and can get on with something else in the real world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ever felt like Skyrim's third-person gameplay could do with an update to give it a more modern action-RPG feel, this could be just the ticket. 
"True Directional Movement - Modernised Third Person Gameplay" is a mod by Ershin for Skyrim: Special Edition on PC that, well, does exactly what it says on the tin. The mod overhauls Skyrim's third-person gameplay to allow you to move and attack from any direction, while there's also a target lock component to help you keep track of enemies. This target lock comes with an animated health bar widget above enemies, with bosses getting their own (much larger) health bars. 
Here's a demonstration of what all this looks like in practice:

We’re pleased to announce the release of Kubernetes 1.22, the second release of 2021!
This release consists of 53 enhancements: 13 enhancements have graduated to stable, 24 enhancements are moving to beta, and 16 enhancements are entering alpha. Also, three features have been deprecated.
In April of this year, the Kubernetes release cadence was officially changed from four to three releases yearly. This is the first longer-cycle release related to that change. As the Kubernetes project matures, the number of enhancements per cycle grows. This means more work, from version to version, for the contributor community and Release Engineering team, and it can put pressure on the end-user community to stay up-to-date with releases containing increasingly more…]]></summary>

Addressing investors during Activision Blizzard's Q2 2021 results call this evening, Kotick said, "I want to start by making clear to everyone that there's no place in our company where discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment of any kind will be tolerated. Nowhere.
"We so appreciate the current and former employees who've come forward in past recent days with courage and I want to reiterate the commitments we've made to you. Our work environment, everywhere we operate, will not permit discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment. We will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry."

Coach, Ellis, Nick, and Rochelle - who debuted in Valve's seminal co-operative FPS sequel all the way back in 2009 (and who finally returned to action in 2020's official The Last Stand update) - come to Zombie Army 4 as part of Rebellion's free Left 4 Dead Character Pack 2, available now on all platforms. They follow the original Left 4 Dead's cast, who joined Zombie Army 4 as playable characters earlier this year.
The new group's arrival coincides with Zombie Army 4's Season 3 finale, which wraps up its current storyline in new campaign mission Return to Hell. "Our intrepid squad [are thrust] back into the underworld," teases Rebellion, "but this time it is a haunted manifestation of Schweiger's mind which they must survive in order to free him from Baron Umbra."

Art of Rally, which initially launched on PC toward the end of last year, delivers a top-down, faintly retro twist on the rally racing formula, sending players careening across low-poly renditions of Finland, Germany, Japan, Norway, and Sardinia as they tackle its 60 rally stages.
It features 61 "iconic" rally cars from the 60s to the 80s, and includes daily and weekly leaderboard challenges, ghost racing, and more alongside its sizeable career mode - all unfolding to the beat of Art of Rally's delicious, 80s-hued synth soundtrack.

Players of Ubisoft's competitive multiplayer shooter have complained they are constantly joining matches where other players are exploiting the way the game works in Japan to farm for in-game currency.
This in-game currency, known as Renown, is earned primarily by completing matches. You can also earn some extra Renown from daily challenges and from Ubisoft Connect, which is Ubisoft's cross-platform social and loyalty hub. Players use Renown to unlock operators, weapon attachments and customisation items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who knows how long we'll be waiting for the release of The Elder Scrolls 6, so here's yet another fantasy RPG to add to your waiting list, as a studio led by former Elder Scrolls devs has unveiled its upcoming game.  
The Wayward Realms is an open-world RPG being made by a team that includes Ted Peterson, Julian LeFay and Vijay Lakshman (who all worked on the Elder Scrolls series). Developer Once Lost Games describes it as a "new class of game" called "the Grand RPG," promising in-depth class and combat systems, complex faction dynamics, and "choice and consequence... experienced on a scale never attempted before". 
"The Wayward Realms is set on a group of over one hundred islands, ranging from small to massive, known collectively as the Archipelago, where scores of factions vie for influence and power," says the official game description. "Dynasties strive to maintain the status quo, upstarts seek to earn their place at the top, and intriguing power-houses set generational plots into motion.

But in a statement to IGN, McDonald's Australia stated that "the image was provided to media in error and there is no commercial relationship between McDonald's Australia and Sony PlayStation." 
The controllers were covered with a motif of the brand's signature Big Mac and Fries, with yellow-coloured buttons and a massive McDonald's logo centred on the touchpad, just to remind you who your fast-food overlord is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Take-Two says it'll be announcing an "exciting new franchise" later this month with a release planned before the end of the current fiscal year in March 2022. 
The news (as spotted by VGC) comes via Take-Two's Q1 2022 earnings call and follows pre-E3 leaks earlier this year - corroborated by VentureBeat's Jeff Grubb - revealing two new unannounced games from the publisher.
Mafia 3 studio Hangar 13 is said to be working on a title described as "Cthulhu meets Saints Row" while XCOM developer Firaxis is reportedly creating a Marvel-themed turn-based strategy game. And while Take-Two offered no hint as to nature of its "new franchise" in its earnings call, this month's Gamescom digital event seems a likely candidate for a full reveal.

Dice announced the existence of its new "standalone" cinematic short, titled Exodus, over on Twitter earlier today, revealing the mini-movie will detail the events that ultimately "trigger an all-out war" within the universe of 2042.
As Eurogamer's Martin Robinson explained earlier this year, despite Battlefield 2042 eschewing a solo campaign to focus on multiplayer, it does still play out against a narrative backdrop: a humanitarian crisis brought about by climate change, where nomadic refugees known as No-Pats take up arms as the United States and Russia engage in "all-out war".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another month means a fresh batch of additions to Sony's PlayStation Now service, with August's offerings now confirmed to be Nier: Automata, Ghostrunner, and Undertale.
Nier: Automata is probably the biggest eye-catcher, providing another opportunity to experience developer Platinum Games' celebrated action-RPG. Creator Yoko Taro's second Nier outing - which follows the dystopian travails of androids 2B and 9S - is as richly atmospheric and dizzyingly inventive as its predecessor, mixing Platinum's tried-and-tested hack-and-slash action with ample genre-busting surprises as its layers are gradually revealed.
"Those searching for an endlessly imaginative dreamlike journey," wrote Jeffrey Matulef in his Recommended review, "will find Nier: Automata too mesmerising to look away from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To usher in Black Panther's arrival on 16th August, Marvel's Avengers is having a free trial weekend on Steam, PlayStation, and Stadia. It kicked off on 29th July and ends later today, 1st August, sending interest in the action game on PC soaring.
Looking at SteamDB (thanks, TheGamer), the game usually averages around only a few hundred concurrent users at a time, but the freeplay event has set a 24-hour peak of 10,161 players - with 10,121 online right now at the time of writing.
It doesn't quite hit the heights of its launch period - Marvel's Avengers peaked at almost 32,000 Steam players when it released last September - but it's a considerable spike for a game that had hitherto struggled to get even 1000 simultaneous PC players online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has reportedly sanctioned the release of Half-Life 2: Remastered Collection, a passion-project mod that "completely overhauls" the seminal shooter. 
As noted by SteamDB (thanks, PCGN), the collection comes from Filip Victor and is "not Valve related", but Tyler McVicker - who focuses on news about Valve and Steam - reports that the remaster has "Valve's consent".
It's apparently the next iteration of the fantastic mod Half-Life 2: Update, a "completely free and extensive community-developed update for Half-Life 2 featuring beautiful lighting, countless bug fixes, and a brand new Community Commentary Mode". It's available to anyone who owns Half-Life 2 on PC and offers "countless" bug fixes in "one free standalone download".

To celebrate Halo's 20th anniversary, the doughnut purveyor has created a special edition Halo Infinite doughnut that boasts blue icing and a familiar helmet. It'll be available between 30th July and 30th September, although right now - I'm very sorry to say - it seems limited to Krispy Kreme Brazil.
That's not the only thing getting Halo fans excited, though. The advertisement has some people speculating that the ad has solidified Halo Infinite's vague "Q4 2021" release window, too, teasing: "Why wait for November?"

The statistic came courtesy of Conor Ford, who manages Apex security at developer Respawn. They confirmed that of the 2086 players banned on 29th July 2021, 1965 had been playing on PS4, 62 on Xbox, 44 on PC, and 15 on Nintendo Switch.
The ban hammer primarily targeted players caught "dashboarding", players who forcefully shut down the game at the end of a losing match to avoid losing RP. By abusing it, players can erroneously maintain their high-rank status but thankfully, Respawn noticed the trend.

Taking to the official website to explain the changes, Final Fantasy 14's producer and director Naoki Yoshida said that the team didn't think the job's icon was a "particularly big" deal, but soon "received feedback from players all over the world" that the icon "made them uncomfortable or fearful".
"This aversion is known as trypophobia, and those who have it feel disgust and fear when they see clusters of small holes or bumps," Yoshida explained (thanks, PC Gamer). "The severity of the reaction varies between people, and what triggers it in some may not do so in others.

Halo Infinite is the franchise's first foray into the world of multiplayer bots, and developer 343 is using the technical preview to gather feedback on bot behaviour and online performance. To that end, the technical preview debuted with the Bot Arena playlist, which puts four players against four bots on arena maps.
The technical preview launched with bots that felt pretty easy, and last night I won every game against them. But while I slept, 343 pushed an update that added ODST difficulty bots and a new map, Recharge. And I am here to report these ODST bots are not messing about.

More than 2000 current and former Activision Blizzard employees signed a petition calling the company's response to the recent discrimination lawsuit "abhorrent and insulting".
Activision Blizzard's initial public comment on the lawsuit was to strongly deny its claims. An email then sent to staff by Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend, who was the assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism to George W. Bush from 2004 to 2008, has been heavily criticised by staff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horizon Forbidden West, the highly anticipated follow-up to Guerrilla Games' acclaimed open-world action-adventure Horizon Zero Dawn, has reportedly been delayed into 2022.
Announced last summer, Horizon Forbidden West was originally set to launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5 toward the end of this year; however, Sony hinted a slip might be possible back it June, when it announced God of War: Ragnarok would now be a 2022 title. "We think we are on track to release [Horizon Forbidden West] this holiday season," said PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst at the time, "But that isn't quite certain yet, and we're working as hard as we can to confirm that to you as soon as we can."
Hints that Sony was now leaning toward delaying Horizon Forbidden West's release into next year first surfaced yesterday, courtesy of GameBeat journalist Jeff Grubb, who suggested the company was still "undecided" on the matter during his Giant Bomb show. However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has now weighed in with the more definite statement that "Sony has delayed the PlayStation exclusive... to the first quarter of 2022", according to his source.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Two Point Studios' wonderful medical management sim Two Point Hospital is getting in on Sonic's 30th anniversary celebrations with a free selection of costumes and items for all platforms inspired by the hedgehog's video game adventures.
The snappily titled Sonic the Hedgehog Pack is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Steam as part of Two Point Hospital's latest update, bringing a total of four outfits for hospital staff to wear - based on Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles - as well as various theme-appropriate decorations. There's a massive Sonic statue, for instance, plus the likes of Sonic rugs and posters, stylised sunflowers and palm trees, totem poles, and even a big ol' spinning gold ring.
Sonic's Two Point Hospital intrusion comes as the management sim enjoys a variety of heavy discounts and promotional events across different platforms. There's a free trial on Switch until 8th August for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in certain countries - as well as 30% off the game and all DLC - and it's currently free to play for all Steam users until 2nd August. Discounts there include 75% off the base game and up to 50% off all DLC until 5th August.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Icarus, the sci-fi survival game from DayZ creator Dean Hall, will no longer launch on 11th August as originally announced and is now expected to arrive some time this November.
Icarus (now a full-price release after developer RocketWerkz pivoted away from its initial free-to-play plans) casts players as deep-space prospectors attempting to salvage what they can from the surface of a hostile alien planet following a terraforming disaster.
"Icarus was once destined to be a second Earth," explains the game's Steam page, "but when terraforming collapsed, the air turned toxic and humanity's hopes of colonising a new world died... Yet when xeno-biologists discovered the cause of the failure - exotic matter - new interest was ignited. Valuable beyond reckoning, these 'exotics' sparked a gold rush, fuelling political tensions on Earth, and bringing prospectors flocking to Icarus."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've all been there - chests overflowing with gold, rubies on the floor, amber pearls somehow floating around in your food storage. And not a merchant in sight to help you spend it all. But the upcoming Hearth and Home update for Valheim should help with your treasure storage problems, as it's due to add a bunch of shiny new items to help you create your own bank vault.
As explained in a blog post, the developers at Iron Gate are now returning from their summer holidays to continue work on Hearth and Home, which is the first major update for Valheim since its launch. The team are apparently still on track to deliver the update "this very quarter", so we shouldn't have to wait much longer to see all the delicious goodies arriving in the patch (like Eyescream, Shocklate Smoothies and the ominously-named "wolf meats"). 
This update isn't just about food, however, and you'll soon be able to create your very own treasure trove. Coin stacks and coin piles will be added as items that can be crafted from your excess gold. If you don't want it all on display, you can store your bling in a special treasure chest. And if you want to secure all your earnings, you might want to craft the new iron gate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what appears to be a world first, a Twitch streamer has completed a blindfolded speedrun of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Yep, you read that right. 
Earlier this week streamer Mitchriz completed Sekiro's Shura ending with a time of four hours, 35 minutes and 13 seconds, all while blindfolded. Here's a clip of the moment he completed the run - spoilers for the final boss, obviously:
It's worth watching the rest of the run, too, as it's fascinating to see how Mitchriz navigates Sekiro's world using only audio cues. (Rather conveniently, he also has an input overlay so you can see what he's doing with his mouse and keyboard.) On sections near cliff edges, Mitchriz has to carefully count down the seconds to measure how far he's walking in any one direction, often darting forwards to help control his movements. On some occasions Mitchriz slashes with a sword until he hits a wall, with the change in sound indicating his position. Grapple points seem to serve as useful tools for navigation, while enemy sounds and cutscenes also help telegraph his position.
