        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space creator Glen Schofield's very Dead-Space-like sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol finally has a release date and is heading to PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC on 2nd December this year.


The Callisto Protocol, which was officially unveiled back in December 2020, is a third-person horror game set in 2320. Its action unfolds within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter's moon Callisto, and - needless to say - suffocating terror and "terrifying secrets" ensue.


We've only seen a single cinematic of The Callisto Protocol since its intriguing 2020 reveal, so it's nice to finally, properly see the thing in action courtesy of its brand-new release date trailer - which includes a smattering of gameplay - below. It looks like appropriately atmospheric, deliciously icky stuff - and, yes, not entirely dissimilar to Dead Space.

Horizon Call of the Mountain, which was announced back in January, is a first-person experience set the series' gorgeous, post-apocalypse world. It casts players as a new character -  Ryas, a former Shadow Carja Warrior who hopes to redeem himself by investigating a grave threat to the Sundom - and sets them on an adventure featuring main series protagonist Aloy and a host of other familiar faces.


Call of the Mountain's new trailer, revealed during tonight's PlayStation State of Play, offers a first proper look at the game in action - including some of the activities players will be able to partake in using Sony's upgraded VR kit, such as archery and mountain climbing - and it would be an understatement to say it all looks spectacular indeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Casting for Sony's live-action Twisted Metal series continues, with the news that Will Arnett - known for the likes of BoJack Horseman, The Lego Batman Movie, and Arrested Development - will voice the role of insane clown Sweet Tooth.


According to Variety, the show's version of the iconic Sweet Tooth is a "hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning. A lover of chaos, this majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses 'Lost Vegas' as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck."


The Twisted Metal series - a half-hour action comedy scripted by Cobra Kai writer Michael Jonathan Smith for Peacock - follows a motor-mouthed outsider, played by Anthony Mackie, who's offered a chance at a better life as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland dominated by savage marauders driving vehicles of destruction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yesterday's brief gameplay tease, Sega has released a considerably more substantial seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay, offering a much clearer look at how the hedgehog's first foray into open-world platforming will likely play out.


Yesterday's footage was perhaps most notable for the rather muted art style Sega has opted for this time around, with the game - at least from what we've seen so far - placing Sonic in a realistically hewn world that almost feels closer to the sodden, boulder-pocked hillsides of Death Stranding than it does the colour-blasted Sonic backdrops of old.


We get to see a lot more of that expansive landscape in Sega's newly shared seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay (thanks IGN), with the bulk of the footage focused on leisurely exploration as Sonic roams around, solving puzzles to unlock new elements in the world.

First announced at BlizzCon in 2018 - where it was less than warmly received by attendees - Diablo Immortal takes place between the events of Diablo 2 and 3, adapting the classic dungeon crawling formula of its predecessors for mobile devices - which, among other things, means a free-to-play monetisation model based around in-app purchases.


Starting out in the city of Westmarch, players can adopt one of six classes - Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Crusader, Necromancer, or Demon Hunter - and journey out to explore eight areas along with other adventurers. Blizzard and co-developer NetEase have previously said additional zones, storylines, loot, and classes will be added over time.

Last year, Xbox created a limited number of Pride controllers but many players wanted it to be universally available. This year's controller will therefore be customisable in the Xbox Design Lab.

For those who don't know already, Autonauts is a game where you build and then train robots to automate the world around you. Sounds easy enough, but there is a catch. In short, these robots are only ever going to be as smart as you tell them to be.
It is up to you as the player to teach your bots what do. You will need to upgrade them and expand their brains as the game progresses, opening up their full operational potential. You can build dozens of different workerbots on your planet and make it a "fully functioning home" with their help. By fully functioning home, we are talking cooking, mining, construction, you name it.

"Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet allow multiplayer gameplay with up to four players," The Pokémon Company said. "Along with series staples, such as trading and battling Pokémon, you will be able to explore the various locations of the region in these games with other players. You can discover new Pokémon and explore unfamiliar areas with your friends and family, opening the door to an adventure more precious and fun than ever!"

Author: Paris Pittman (Steering Committee)
Last year, we published our first Annual Report Summary for 2020 and it's already time for our second edition!
2021 Annual Report Summary
This summary reflects the work that has been done in 2021 and the initiatives on deck for the rest of 2022. Please forward to organizations and indidviduals participating in upstream activities, planning cloud native strategies, and/or those looking to help out. To find a specific community group's complete report, go to the kubernetes/community repo under the groups folder. Example: sig-api-machinery/annual-report-2021.md
You’ll see that this report summary is a growth area in itself. It takes us roughly 6 months to prepare and execute, which isn’t helpful or valuable to anyone as a fast moving project with short and long term needs. How can we make this better?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yu Suzuki - the legendary designer behind the likes of Sega classics Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, OutRun, and Space Harrier - has unveiled new 3D shooter Air Twister, which is making its way to Apple Arcade on 24th June.


Air Twister is a fantasy "swipe" shooter - developed by Shenmue 3 studio YS Net - that asks players, in the role of Princess Arch, to battle alien invaders and save their planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


As the trailer reveals, there's a definite Space Harrier vibe to the whole thing - with a touch of Panzer Dragoon thrown in when our lead takes to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and, according to an interview attended by GameSpot, Air Twister is based on a fantasy shooting game Yu Suzuki envisaged in the 80s, before he adapted the idea into Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ofcom has published its annual report into the UK's online habits - including plenty of stats for how many of us are now playing online games, paying for subscriptions, and trying to beat Wordle. 


39 percent of UK adults aged 16 or over play games online, Ofcom says, with 56 percent of children aged three to 15 playing games online. The average time spent each week playing games online was 7 hours and 33 minutes, including PC, console, VR and smartphone gaming.


These figures come from Ofcom surveys completed in late 2021, so after formal lockdowns had ended, Ofcom noted. In general, there was a dip in the amount of time younger people played online games year-on-year, though a growth in time spent playing online games for those aged 55-64.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adeline Software's much-loved Little Big Adventure series can now be enjoyed with a welcome selection of modern day niceties - including cloud saves, controller support, and Steam achievements - thanks to a brand-new update on Steam.


The original Little Big Adventure - an evocative blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that followed young hero Twinsen as he attempted to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994 and was followed by a sequel three years later. Needless to say, at now over a quarter of a century old, both were decidedly lacking in modern day polish.


Developer 2.21, which now owns the rights to the series (and counts Little Big Adventure co-creator Didier Chanfray as a founder), announced it would be upgrading Little Big Adventure 1 & 2 back in March, although there was no estimated time of arrival for its enhancements.

Sonic Frontiers was first teased at the end of last May (with only the vaguest of CGI trailers and no name), but it wasn't until December that first proper details emerged, with Sega describing the title as Sonic's "first ever open zone" game.


"Accelerate to new heights and experience the thrill of high velocity open-zone freedom," the publisher said at the time. "Battle powerful enemies as you speed through the Starfall Islands - landscapes brimming with dense forests, overflowing waterfalls, sizzling deserts and more!".

THQ Nordic has revealed that Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is heading our way on 30th August, with alien invader Crypto - or to be more precise, the next Crypto: Cryptosporidium 138 - leading the charge (ok, so maybe "that planet burning kind" is actually still accurate...).
THQ has promised this release will be a faithful remake of 2006's alien filled caper, complete with "five huge open-world areas". These areas are Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and, what with this being a game with an out of this world entity roaming through its maps, the Moon. 
But, who exactly will players come across within these vast maps? Well, as Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is set in the swinging '60s, you will have to deal with more than a small handful of hippies on your quest for glory. Oh, yes, and there is also the small matter of the KGB as well. You can check out the latest trailer for Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SCS, the developer behind Euro Truck Simulator 2, has made the decision to cancel its upcoming "Heart of Russia" expansion in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine.
"On the 24th of February 2022, our Heart of Russia team was some six to eight weeks away from completing work on the highly anticipated new DLC. We all felt really good about the result; a lot of effort had been invested in making this new region look truly fantastic in the game," SCS shared in a blog post yesterday.
"We were absolutely sure that our community, especially those in Russia, would really appreciate that. Then, all of a sudden, the entire world was rocked by the news that Ukraine had been invaded by Russia."

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Although cyber conflict has existed for thirty years, the strategic utility of cyber operations remains unclear. Many expect cyber operations to provide independent utility in both warfare and low-intensity competition. Underlying these expectations are broadly shared assumptions that information technology increases operational effectiveness. But a growing body of research shows how cyber operations tend to fall short of their promise. The reason for this shortfall is their subversive mechanism of action. In theory, subversion provides a way to exert influence at lower risks than force because it is secret and indirect, exploiting systems to use them against adversaries. The mismatch between promise and practice is the consequence of the subversive trilemma of cyber operations, whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables. A case study of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict provides empirical support for the argument. Qualitative analysis leverages original data from field interviews, leaked documents, forensic evidence, and local media. Findings show that the subversive trilemma limited the strategic utility of all five major disruptive cyber operations in this conflict...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The video, posted to YouTube by Foulowe59, shows a montage of gameplay footage apparently filmed on Nintendo's showfloor booth at E3 2005. 


It was there that the game was shown off in a demo reel, as part of various upcoming GameCube and Nintendo DS titles. Alas, as we now know, this Kirby never made it much further.

Coming from reliable source Deallabs, the PlayStation Plus games for June are reportedly  God of War (2018), Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl. These games will be available from 7th June until 5th July.
Some have seen the inclusion of God of War as a hint that Sony may be looking to up the marketing for its sequel, God of War: Ragnarök. After all, the game is still slated to release some time this year, and that 2022 window is rapidly getting smaller and smaller (I for one can't believe we are nearly in June already!).

Brotherhood takes place during the Clone Wars, and stars both Anakin Skywalker and Kenobi off on another adventure. But it's the novel's cameos which have sparked some extra attention - seeing as they acknowlege a couple of well-known video games (thanks, GamesRadar). 


For starters, Brotherhood apparently includes a "blink-and-you'll-miss-it" appearance by Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order star Cal Kestis, who was but a youngling at the time of the novel's events.

"Think of it like flapping your wings," explains sofiaharley. "One little flap will only bring you up a little bit, but if you keep flapping you can go as high as you like!"

The removal was spotted over the weekend by Jon Cartwright and appears to be recent (thanks, VG247). SoulCalibur for the OG Xbox has also been delisted, it was noted, although this seems to have happened some time ago. 

SoulCalibur 2 HD now shows a "not available separately" message when attempting to buy the game via the Microsoft Store's website - though it does not appear to be available elsewhere as part of any bundle - and "not available at this time" via Xbox consoles.

Snap was a key feature - and one of the few selling points - of the Xbox One at its launch. The handy ability let you stick an app to one side of your screen while continuing to play games alongside.

The new model, which is set to release on 1st August, will have 1062 pieces, and on completion will stand at 31cm. And he won't just be a static companion to add to your collection. Rather, he will have a head that can be "tilted back, forward and sideways for maximum cuteness".
As well as the ability to pose BD-1, those who purchase their own little droid companion this summer will also get to experience other neat little inclusions, such as the back of BD-1's head being translucent to show the droid's mood and a display sign (see below). He probably won't be able to heal you like he does for Cal, however.

The discovery has fans speculating - and hoping - that this may mean that, after a seven year absence, Activision is moving away from battle.net exclusivity on PC and bringing its first-person shooter back to Valve's PC client, Steam.

As spotted by u/Kalinine and posted to Reddit, the Modern Warfare 2 Ghost artwork "show[ed] up on Steam". When pushed for clarification, the user added: "it shows up at the bottom of the DLC page for some Call of duty games like Black Ops 3".

Ramiro Galan - a principal designer at Pixelkings - shared a handful of never-before-seen images on their digital portfolio, showing off what appears to be the cancelled game's character creation screen. 

"Here is a series of styles and screens by Ramiro Galan for a cancelled Marvel MMO title," the album's description tells us. "Emphasis was on rich and vibrant colours with stylistic tones that pay homage to Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse. All design, 3D materials, lighting, and post process FX were done by Ramiro Galan."

Ruby - who hails from Ash vs. Evil Dead - has yet to make an appearance in the main game, and her absence from the roster was a surprising omission to some given the plethora of other characters from Evil Dead stories, both old and new.

Now - thanks to a second batch of datamined voice files from our hero roster - it seems like she will indeed be making an appearance, seemingly batting for the Demons in these particular scenarios, although it's not totally beyond the realm of possibility that she may turn up as a survivor, too - hopefully we'll get an official reveal soon.

That's according to The Happy Warrior, which says sources at Warner Bros. Montreal have confirmed the publisher has cancelled the Russian version "due to the political fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine".

The rumour is further compounded by confirmation that Gotham Knight's Russian sub-site has been taken offline; the URL now results in a 404 error (it was still live as at 12th May, according to archive.org). Similarly, the Steam page makes no mention of Russian-language support, hinting that both Russian voicework and subtitles have been removed (thanks, VGC).

First up, two more ghost types are joining the spooky menagerie. The names on the reveal image have been intentionally smudged to keep us in suspense, but one says Morai or Morcai - maybe? - and the other, if you squint a bit, looks like Decogen. Or something beginning with D, anyway.

"Each of these directors failed either to recognise that Activision Blizzard for years maintained unsafe workplaces exhibiting frequent and repeated sexual harassment, sexual assault, and gender discrimination, or to appropriately address the Company’s 'frat house' culture once it was publicly revealed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) in its pending lawsuit, which was filed in July 2021," the damning letter states.

While there's little in the way of specifics to accompany today's announcement, EA has confirmed the third-person action-adventure will once again follow the story of Fallen Order protagonist Cal Kestis, albeit five years after the events of the first game.


The teaser trailer released alongside today's announcement doesn't reveal a whole lot more, but we do see Cal, lightsaber in hand and accompanied by trusty robot sidekick BD-1, flexing his action muscles as he remains on the run from the Empire.

Kirby 64 launched as part of Nintendo's Switch Online + Expansion Pack retro collection last week, and players soon began reporting a bug in underwater levels - not seen in the 2000 original - that permanently stunned them after taking damage from certain sources.


In response to those reports, Nintendo has now confirmed a fix is on the way. "A bug has been found in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards for Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online that can prevent players from progressing under a certain condition," it wrote in a tweet.

PvP servers for Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 were "temporarily deactivated" back in January after reports the games were vulnerable to Remote Code Execution exploits began to make headlines.


Several weeks later, Bandai Namco offered an update, saying that "due to the time required to set up proper testing environments, online services for the Dark Souls series on PC will not resume until after the release of Elden Ring". But with Elden Ring having been out in the wild for over two months now, the Dark Souls community was steadily to lose its patience as further updates failed to materialised.

Taking its cue from the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion, Frontier's latest blob of DLC for its park management sequel ushers in a star-studded cast, new features, and, of course, new dinosaurs, amounting to what the studio is calling the game's "biggest DLC to date".


First up, there's a new campaign that'll task players with constructing a Research Compound in multiple stages. This features the vocal talents of Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Campbell Scott in their respective big screen roles, and brings a new feature that'll see players unearthing rare genomes in amber mines to create feathered prehistoric species.

But, happily, there's also more going on - including the recently-confirmed arrival of Pokémon's mysterious extra-dimensional Ultra Beasts. Today, we got our first look at the jellyfish-like Nihilego popping up - appropriately via a wormhole.

The one downside? You can't use Obi-Wan's trusty lightsaber, which instead hangs limply from his trusty Jedi backpack. 


Fortnite has previously featured lightsabers as weapons - and very fun they are too. You can strike, block and perform a neat little combat roll while holding them, and players facing off against each other will often like to go one-on-one with you as a proper duel.

Over 180 million people have played the game since its release in May 2012, with a spike following the Covid-19 outbreak.


Asked how big the uptick in players had been since the pandemic, Vaughan replied: "Interestingly, Plague Inc has always got more popular whenever people get ill, eg When Plague Inc was #1 in Japan - we saw big spikes every time there was a bad flu outbreak. When Ebola was spreading in 2015, we saw a big worldwide spike in players. When Covid first started though we saw the biggest increase in players ever - it lasted for about a month and then went back down to normal levels.

While the device, codenamed Keystone, has never formally been shown, earlier leaks pointed to a mini box similar to a shrunk down Xbox Series S, which acted as a hub for Ethernet, USB and HDMI ports.


Xbox's plan - which still seems to be in place, albeit no longer in the immediate future - is to launch Keystone as a small gadget capable of streaming Xbox Game Pass titles to any monitor or TV screen with no extra console hardware required.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another round of layoffs has hit embattled Mafia 3 studio Hangar 13, with around 50 people affected. 


It follows an earlier round of job losses last November, when 200 positions were at risk, and the departure of the studio's head Haden Blackman earlier this month.


These latest job losses will affect Hangar 13's main location in California, Kotaku reported. Staff were informed remotely by Hangar 13's new boss Nick Baynes, who ran the company's Brighton location before succeeding Blackman as overall company head.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotham Knights' development team has addressed the recent criticism surrounding its depiction of Barbara Gordon.
During a recent Q&A, fans asked more about the development of Barbara, aka Batgirl. This was following a backlash to her character's biography on the game's website, which described her as training to "recover from her wounds" so that she could "return to active duty as Batgirl".
In the comic books, Barbara Gordon is shot in the spine by Joker, leading to her using a wheelchair. While she may not have the exact same backstory in Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. previously stated Barbara was in a wheelchair following a "face-off".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since its unveiling in 2020, Dead Space creator Glen Schofield's sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol has conjured images of Dead Space, so it was a bit of a surprise when, due to various studio connections, it was announced the game would be set in the PUBG Universe. That, however, is no longer the case, with Schofield now saying it's its "own story and world".


The Callisto Protocol is a third-person horror game set in 2320, with its action unfolding within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter's moon Callisto. While that set-up mightn't immediately scream PUBG to onlookers, the connection came from the fact developer Striking Distance was explicitly established by PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton to create narrative-driven games that would expand the universe introduced in the battle royale hit.


As Schofield explained in a recent GameInformer cover feature on The Callisto Protocol, "When we came in, [Krafton] had a lore team and they were writing this big story, like, 'Where does PUBG start? Where does it fit in?'". Had those plans continued, the horror game would have sat "pretty far out" along the timeline, but somewhere during development the idea was dropped.

Kubernetes StatefulSets, since their introduction in
1.5 and becoming stable in 1.9, have been widely used to run stateful applications. They provide stable pod identity, persistent
per pod storage and ordered graceful deployment, scaling and rolling updates. You can think of StatefulSet as the atomic building
block for running complex stateful applications. As the use of Kubernetes has grown, so has the number of scenarios requiring
StatefulSets. Many of these scenarios, require faster rolling updates than the currently supported one-pod-at-a-time updates, in the
case where you're using the OrderedReady Pod management policy for a StatefulSet.
Here are some examples:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary actor Ray Liotta, who made a memorable impact on the world of gaming as the voice of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City protagonist Tommy Vercetti in 2002, has died aged 67.


Although Liotta only ever starred in one other game - Call of Duty: Black Ops 2's DLC pack Mob of the Dead in 2013 - the actor had a long, enormously prolific career in both film and television, appearing in wide variety of productions, ranging from beloved baseball movie Field of Dreams to ER, and, more recently, Apple's psychological thriller Black Bird.


Arguably his most iconic role, though, remains his 1990 breakthrough performance in Martin Scorsese's movie classic Goodfellas, where he starred as real-life mobster Henry Hill alongside the likes of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft's long-awaited The Wild Update - which includes two new biomes, new mobs, and various other delights - finally has a release date, and will be launching on 7th June.


The Wild Update's first major addition comes in the form of the new Mangrove Swamp biome, bringing mangrove trees and a new natural (and craftable) resource known as mud blocks. It also ushers in the highly anticipated Deep Dark biome, which was originally due to launch as part of the Caves & Cliffs update before getting delayed.


The Deep Dark biome, as its name very much implies, is Minecraft's deepest area to date, and is found beneath the game's current bedrock layer. Here, curious adventures will uncover remnants of a ruined civilisation as well as creepy, eyeless mobs known as Wardens. These fearsome foes react to vibrations, meaning stealth is the key to survival, and can also be summoned if careless explorers stumble into the new Shrieker traps.

You can pick up the base game and almost all its DLC on PC for around £16 in the latest Humble charity bundle.


Cities: Skylines was a solidly entertaining city builder when it released all the way back in 2015, but seven years of expansions and other post-launch DLC haved created a game of truly amazing scope. However, getting your hands on absolutely everything that's released thus far is, inevitably, an extremely pricey undertaking even during sale season.


Hop over to the Humble Store right now though, and you can pick up publisher Paradox Interactive's Cities: Skylines Colossal Collection. This features a total of 32 items (usually costing £204.39), including the base game, plus its After Dark, Snowfall, Natural Disasters, Mass Transit, Green Cities, Parklife, Industries, Campus, and Sunset Harbour expansions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its latest earnings report, CD Projekt has offered an revised breakdown of the projects currently occupying the studio's time, confirming the "bulk of" its development capacity is now focused on Cyberpunk 2077's story expansion, which is still expected to launch next year.


Following Cyberpunk's disastrous release at the tail-end of 2020, the majority of CD Projekt's development resources (as shown in the chart below) were focused on remedying the game's most pressing issues. At the same time, a smaller team was working on its next-gen release, promised long before the project's launch woes, and an even smaller group was doing preliminary work on its paid expansion.


Inevitably, those numbers have shifted considerably over time - less than half of CD Projekt's development staff were working on Cyberpunk's base game and next-gen update by June last year, for instance - and that trend has, unsurprisingly, continued. As per today's financial results, Cyberpunk 2077 support has "shrunk considerably" following the release of its next-gen update (which CD Projekt says had "a positive effect on the game's perception and sales figures"), with the "bulk of [the studio's] development capacity" now working on its expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week's initial rollout of Sony's new PlayStation Plus - limited, so far, to countries in Asia - has been plagued by complaints from fans who stacked subscriptions ahead of time and unexpectedly found Sony wanted them to cough up the difference when converting their membership to its new tiers.


Numerous users reported via social media that they had been told they would have to pay up for any difference in pricing - achieved via stacking or from redeeming discounted PlayStation Plus offers - for the full term of their remaining subscription balance. It was a situation that left some with eye-opening charges to suddenly cough up.


Now, following general confusion and a good deal of online backlash, Sony has finally acknowledged the situation and termed it as a "technical error" which "has been fixed".

In a financial presentation last night, Sony exec Jim Ryan noted that, despite a strong launch, PS5 sales were lagging behind PS4 in its equivalent second year owing to supply constraints.


Those supply constraints are due to both the Covid pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine, but remain a top priority for Sony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June is almost upon us, and for motorsport fans thoughts are turning to some public roads in the centre of France that will soon be closed off for the greatest race of them all. It's Le Mans month! And what better way to whet your appetite than by taking to the wheel of the winner of last year's race, Toyota's GR010 hypercar which today makes its video game debut in Gran Turismo 7 thanks to its latest update. 


Oh, there are some other cars too - namely a new GT Vision Suzuki and an outrageous beefed up Camaro going under the Roadster Shop Rampage name. They come alongside some new Scapes in New Orleans to snap your cars - and once you're done admiring the new cars you can take part in the Gran Turismo World Series which is kicking off in Gran Turismo 7 this weekend, with the preliminary rounds open to all-comers taking place on 27th May and 28th May. 


The World Series grand finale will be returning to a real life event in Monte Carlo this November - a fitting backdrop for what's become one of the glitziest online racing competitions in recent years, and one that's delivered some decent action too.

The original For The King, if you're unfamiliar, was a thoroughly entertaining (if sometimes brutally challenging) blend of familiar RPG stables - think dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - streamlined into a light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure.


More than anything, it was a wonderfully designed little story generator - encompassing everything from haunted carnivals to suffocating jungles - with enough potential combinations across its moving parts to feel sufficiently different each run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator's free Top Gun: Maverick expansion has remained something of a mystery since its announcement last June, but now, with the update finally here on Xbox and PC, developer Asobo has detailed exactly what to expect when it's fired up for the first time.


One notable oddity of the Top Gun expansion is that it'll be launching without what's arguably its biggest feature: the F/A-18E Super Hornet. However, that's only because Asobo made the decision to release the plane early as part of last year's free Game of the Year Edition update when the expansion was delayed alongside the Top Gun: Maverick movie.


Even without the plane as its flagship addition, though, there's still plenty for simmers to grapple with, starting with three training missions for the F/A-18E, all designed to help pilots master "radical flight maneuvers including unrestricted take-offs, split S maneuvers, and low altitude, high-speed maneuvering through complex terrain."

First up in terms of major new features is multiplayer, currently scheduled to arrive some time this "summer". Details are scarce at this juncture, but Funcom's roadmap makes reference to both co-op play and "free-for-all" PvP, with up to four players supported at one time.


Also due this summer is a brand-new faction, but specifics are even more limited in this case. All we're getting for the time being is the tease of a suitably mysterious silhouette and a note that the faction will include a "new victory condition".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barely a month has gone by since the arrival of No Man's Sky's major Outlaws update, which gave intergalactic explorers the opportunity to live out their pirate fantasies, but already Hello Games is back - this time with a brand-new expedition that finally answers fan pleas to add space whales (of a sort) to the exploratory sim.
Expeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are effectively No Man's Sky's stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle its various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. And today's addition, titled Leviathan, is a very different proposition to April's The Blighted, and sounds considerably more ambitious - and significantly weirder - than any of the expeditions we've seen before. 
That said, Leviathan begins in much the same way as previous expeditions, dropping all players into one location. However, what follows is something closer to a roguelike experience, stripping explorers of their progress whenever they die. The narrative twist, though, is that players are actually stuck in a mysterious time loop, and the entire community will need to work together to find a way to break free.

Inspired by classic slasher films of the 1980s, it's a narrative-driven game that sees you escaping a house by solving puzzles, making dialogue decisions, and avoiding the killer.


That's an impossible feat at first, but repeated attempts at escape will put all the pieces together. And judging by the trailer below, its low-fi graphics only add to the horrifying atmosphere.

The footage may only be short, but it is absolutely gorgeous and packed with swelling music and sprawling, otherworldly, vistas. Enfant Terrible created this trailer (of sorts) by using "footage from different Unreal Engine 5 reels and projects" to imagine how Bethesda's "Space Opera" could look on its release.

As noticed by PSVortex, games such as Horizon: Forbidden West and Cyberpunk 2077 will have trials lasting five hours, which seems a fairly generous offering.
Meanwhile, other titles such as the recently released Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection and WWE 2K22, only offer trials for two hours.

The exact reasons why are potentially political but also unclear.
5 Żywiołów (5 Elements), the company behind the events, alleges that CD Projekt Red pulled the licence because of a staff member's involvement with the ultra-conservative Polish Catholic organisation Ordo Iuris, which is anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+, and rejects the idea of gender equality.
The staff member in question, Ania Wawrzyniak, is the wife of 5 Żywiołów founder Dastin Wawrzyniak. And according to a Facebook post co-signed by brothers Dastin and Dominic Wawrzyniak, Ania worked as a lawyer for the company for around two years (between 2017 and 2019, they later specified).

Structured logging
The goal of structured

is to replace C-style formatting and the resulting opaque log strings with log
entries that have a well-defined syntax for storing message and parameters
separately, for example as a JSON struct.
When using the traditional klog text output format for structured log calls,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Temtem, developer Crema's massively multiplayer riff on Pokémon, will be leaving early access and getting its full PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 6th September.


Temtem, you might recall, entered Steam early access back in January 2020, selling over half a million copies in its first month of release. Crema has been steadily expanded the game's core creature-collecting and battling action since then - introducing the likes of new Temtem, new islands to explore, and new social and competitive features, not to mention launching an early access version for PS5 - and update 1.0 is now finally in sight.


After more than two years in early access, Temtem is already pretty feature rich, with its pre-release version including the bulk of its story campaign across the Airborne Archipelago, well over 100 Temtem to catch, co-op play, competitive multiplayer, clans, housing, trading, and tournaments. However, its final release promises a number of new additions.

Developer Maxis confirmed it was investigating ways to introduce expanded pronoun options to The Sims 4 last May - following a community petition signed by more than 22,000 people - and players got a first look at the feature's progress during a livestream earlier this year.


And now, with some additional development time under its belt, Maxis has pushed the first iteration of its customisable pronouns feature - developed in conjunction with LGBTQ+ nonprofit organisations It Gets Better and GLAAD - live, delivering what it calls a further step "in the direction of a more inclusive experience for Simmers".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Infinity Ward's next instalment in the long-running Call of Duty series, which was previously confirmed to be near-future sequel Modern Warfare 2 (not to be confused with the 2009 game of the same name), will launch on 28th October. Platforms have yet to be detailed.


Activision Blizzard formally revealed Modern Warfare 2 and its logo in April - after months of rumours and even an official pre-announcement announcement in February.


Following today's release date confirmation, specifics remain extremely light, but the gameplay-free trailer accompanying Activision Blizzard's announcement does include a description revealing a smidgeon more of what's in store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battlefield is as famous for its troubled launches as it is its sandbox multiplayer, but even by its own standards 2042 has been something of a disaster - lumpy, incomplete and with some less than popular decisions along the way such as the expansive maps designed to accommodate the newly expanded 128 player count and the introduction of specialists. 


DICE at least does have some previous in turning around a shaky ship - Battlefield 4 went from a disastrous launch to become one of the most celebrated in the series - and is making the right noises ahead of the belated launch of Battlefield 2042's first season next month. 


While we're not yet privy to the full reveal, a discussion between creative director Lars Gustavsson, senior producer Ryan McArthur and community manager Freeman outlined the studio's commitment to Battlefield 2042 - interesting itself in light of comments made by EA boss Andrew Wilson to investors earlier this month that suggested development on the series is being rethought - as well as what changes to expect.

Constructing the new armory hut will let you show off up to five loadouts and easily swap between them via the game's main menu, so you can build gear for specific situations and shuffle amongst them on the fly. 


It's a handy feature which was also added post-launch to Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Valhalla's predecessor, and no doubt will also encourage a few people to go splash out further on some of this game's flashier cosmetic armour sets. Here's how it looks:

One such find has recently surfaced, and it involves the final memory Link uncovers towards the game's close.
Those who have played through Breath of the Wild will know that Link slowly starts to regain his memories of the events before and during the Great Calamity as the game progresses (of course, this being Breath of the Wild, you could also blast through without collecting a single one of these memories if facing off against Ganon with the bare essentials is more your thing). 
The final memory can only be discovered when players have collected the 12 others scattered across Hyrule and cannot be happened upon by accident (which incidentally is how I found most of them - my geographical recognition was pretty poor during my first playthrough).

"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, based on the legendary The Lord of the Rings trilogy of books by JRR Tolkien, tells of Gollum's experiences from behind-the-scenes in the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring," writes  Daedalic. "After losing his precious ring to Bilbo Baggins, Gollum decides to leave the Misty Mountains and embark on a perilous journey that leads him from the dungeons of Barad-dûr to the realm of the Wood-elves in Mirkwood.   

"In order to survive the dangers of his journey through Middle-earth, Gollum has to sneak and climb and use all his cunning."  As part of a hands-off preview last week, I got to see some of this cunning in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second season of Babylon's Fall content - due next week - will now run for much longer, putting the future of the game into question.


Publisher Square Enix had originally planned each season to last three months, but now that's been doubled. "Based on the feedback we have received from our players, we feel that we need a period to re-evaluate the game's future operating roadmap", according to a blog post from last Friday.


"Season 2 will include the Ver. 1.2.1 small-scale update, but after that we will be using the extra three months of the season extension for development on the next update, and so will not be making any further updates or adding new content during that time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman worked on both The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge all the way back in the early 90's. Now, the duo are returning to the series in the aptly named Return to Monkey Island and in the run up to its release have revealed the one puzzle they regret from their original time working on the series. 
Chatting to GamesBeat, Gilbert and Grossman revealed the Monkey Wrench puzzle from LeChuck's Revenge, which saw Guybrush Threepwood using an actual monkey to activate a seemingly broken pump, was a mistake, calling it "notoriously unsolvable" and "not a good design on several levels". 
"Even if you are an English speaker from a location where the tool in question is commonly called a 'monkey wrench,' and you realise that that's what you need, you still have to make an astonishing predictive leap about how your actions will create that tool," said Grossman. "Nothing in the game sets any of it up adequately."

Blaidd, for the unaware, is an NPC in FromSoftware's epic who's half man and half wolf. He's involved in one of the game's main quests, helps players with one of the major bosses, and has had the furry community in a frenzy.


Welsh voice actor Arthur admits it too. "I know that he's caused quite a stir in the furry world, which I didn't know anything about until I looked on the internet," he says at the start.

The launch gives us our first proper look at the service's full catalogue of games - although fans say it contains far fewer titles in its catalogue than previously expected. 


Indeed, a guide to PlayStation Plus published yesterday on the PlayStation blog mentions "700" games available across the subscription's various plans - a rough figure we've heard from Sony before - albeit with the caveat that these games will vary "over time and plan".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears that Sony is using the PAL version of PS1 classics in its PS Plus subscription.


The subscription has now launched in Asia, but - as spotted by VGC - some PS1 games are using the PAL (Europe, Australia, New Zealand) version instead of the NTSC (Asia, America).


That means they're presented in 50Hz instead of 60Hz, resulting in a lower refresh rate and therefore lower framerates.

Golden Sands has, of course, been at the very centre of Sea of Thieves' current story arc, beginning in January when the beautiful tropical island outpost became shrouded in a mysterious green fog and, amid signs of a desperate battle, saw all its inhabitants disappear.

Quality Assurance testers at Raven Software formally announced their intent to unionise under the name Game Workers Alliance in January - amid then-ongoing strike action following the firing of 12 members of the developer's QA team - but when Activision Blizzard missed a deadline to voluntarily recognise the union, the group filed a petition with independent government agency the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to initiate a union election.


Activision Blizzard contested the filing, but its arguments were rejected by NLRB, whereupon the publisher was reportedly began ramping up its anti-unionisation efforts.

When Sony Bend Studio shared word of Syphon Filter's new trophies last week, it didn't confirm whether other PS1 titles would be getting a similar treatment as part of Sony's revised PlayStation Plus - but with the service now going live, that question has been answered.


Achievement tracking website Exophase has revealed trophy lists for four more PS1 games alongside the previously announced Syphon Filter: I.Q. Intelligent Qube, Hot Shots Golf, Ape Escape, and Wild Arms (which, notably, wasn't on Sony's previous list of PS Plus inclusions).

Majo, an ex-PlayStation IT analyst, initially filed a suit against the company last November, claiming, among other things, that PlayStation paid women less than men in similar jobs, that women were denied promotions, and that she was wrongfully fired "soon after" submitting a signed statement to Sony in 2021 detailing the alleged gender bias she had experienced.


Those initial claims were supported by a raft of new allegations in March, when eight more PlayStation employees, past and present, submitted statements alleging sexual harassment, bullying, gender bias, and an inability to properly investigate these issues at the company.

In Kubernetes, Services are an abstract way to expose
an application running on a set of Pods. Services

How Service ClusterIPs are allocated?
A Service ClusterIP can be assigned:
dynamically
the cluster's control plane automatically picks a free IP address from within the configured IP range for type: ClusterIP Services.
statically

Across your whole cluster, every Service ClusterIP must be unique.

Beyond that, we haven't really heard all that much about it, so it was a pleasant surprise to see the tactics game pop up on the ESRB website (thanks, Gematsu), not least because it included a summary of the game, as well as details as to why the board classified it as a "Teen" game due to its blood, "mild suggestive themes", and violence. There's also confirmation that at some point, a villain kidnaps women and "forces them to work in a brothel".

That's according to Puck (£), which yesterday revealed that EA has been "persistent in pursuing a sale" with a number of companies, including Amazon, Apple, Disney, and NBCUniversal, "emboldened in the wake of the Microsoft-Activision deal".

“In recent years, as media companies have taken greater interest in the rapidly growing gaming industry, [CEO Andrew Wilson] and Electronic Arts have held talks with a number of different potential suitors, including Disney, Apple and Amazon, sources with knowledge of those talks told me,” Puck reporter, Dylan Byers, wrote.

Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards is the latest N64 game to have been released on the Nintendo Online Expansion Pass. Originally released in 2000, it's a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer featuring Kirby's copy abilities, which can be combined into Power Combos, and it joined the Nintendo Switch Online's library of classic games just yesterday.

However, according to Redditor Keyblademasternadroj, there's a bug in underwater levels that "causes you to enter hit stun forever" that can only be rectified by quitting the game.

"The Spotter Scope and its automatic features of marking and following enemies continued to show overly strong performance, causing more stress than enjoyable experiences to our players," Krafton explains. "Therefore, the enemy detection range has been reduced from 1000m to 600m and the white passive marker will not appear automatically in ADS mode."

As for the 1v1 Arena mode? That's now available in Training Mode and welcomes "all types of combat practice in a suspenseful 1v1 setting", as well as curious spectators, too.

Stellaris, a sort of space-faring amalgam of grand strategy and 4X action, burst onto the scene back in 2016 to significant acclaim. Six years on, it's a substantially different beast, with Paradox having made some sweeping changes along the way, most notably in its radical 2.0 release.
The many faceted road to galactic supremacy it present is still a tonne of strategic fun though, even if - as is generally the way with Paradox titles - the purity of the base game has now been somewhat muddied by an increasingly unwieldy stack of post-launch DLC.

Redout 2, which was originally expected to launch on 26th May, builds on the superb racing action of its 2016 predecessor with a whole new set of tracks (36 in total, plus mirror variants of each) alongside expanded customisation options - with players now able to start with one of 12 distinct chassis and strap on the likes of new rocket engines, propulsors, stabilsers, rudders, magnets, intercoolers, flaps, wings, and spoilers.


There's also online multiplayer racing for up to 12 challengers, plus a single-player career campaign, promising "hundreds" of events from a variety of different modes, including Arena Races, Time Attacks, Last Man Standing, and Boss Races.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After one hell of a long wait, the live-action Halo TV adaptation finally arrived earlier this year, and the response has been...mixed. And now Marcus Lehto, co-creator of the videogame series that started all, has shared his own thoughts on the adaptation, saying that while he doesn't "hate" it, he was ultimately "confused by many of the choices that were made".


Paramount+'s Halo adaptation finally launched for US audiences this March - a mere nine years after it was originally announced - and while changes were expected (fans were forewarned that the TV show takes place in the so-called Silver Timeline, separate from the core Halo canon), the end result has certainly proven divisive.


While it was Master Chief's amusing loss of inhibitions that drew the most headlines over the series' run - just episodes after he'd stunned audiences by showing his face for the first time, he'd got his bum out, then ended the series having sex in front of his mum - there's been plenty of criticism around the show's writing, inconsistent tone, uneven plotting, and pacing.

Ugly Sonic, as you'll no doubt be aware, was the original design for Sonic in the 2020 film before fans complained. His dodgy teeth and human eyes were removed, eventually leading to a decent film and better sequel.

Now, in its financial report, Embracer has highlighted its hopes for the future following this acquisition (including potential remakes of some classic titles) saying, "after the end of the quarter, we further strengthened our development capabilities and IP-portfolio by entering into an agreement to acquire Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal, including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and Legacy of Kain and other IPs.
"We see a great potential, not only in sequels, but also in remakes, remasters, spinoffs, as well as transmedia projects across the Group."

Kubernetes v1.24 introduces alpha support for Non-Graceful Node Shutdown. This feature allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node after the original node is shutdown or in a non-recoverable state such as hardware failure or broken OS.
How is this different from Graceful Node Shutdown
You might have heard about the Graceful Node Shutdown capability of Kubernetes,
and are wondering how the Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature is different from that. Graceful Node Shutdown
allows Kubernetes to detect when a node is shutting down cleanly, and handles that situation appropriately.
A Node Shutdown can be "graceful" only if the node shutdown action can be detected by the kubelet ahead

Mysteries were originally discussed back in January, when Rare laid out its plans for Sea of Thieves in 2022. The big gambit this year, if you're unaware, is an ongoing, season-spanning narrative that will progress across monthly in-game story episodes known as Adventures.


It's a promising idea that so far doesn't really seem to have found its footing, with Seas of Thieves' initial set of Adventures having felt decidedly undercooked, both in terms of their challenges and narrative presentation. But with three Adventures now under its belt, Rare is ready to launch the other major component of 2022's ambitious narrative plans: Mysteries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ben Brode, the charismatic former boss of Blizzard's card battler Hearthstone, has finally revealed his new project. It's called Marvel Snap, and is a new multiplayer collectible card game filled with comic book characters.

Brode quit Blizzard back in 2018, after more than 15 years at the company, and before its more recent troubles became public. Alongside others who had worked with him to launch Hearthstone, Brode went on to found his own studio, Second Dinner, which has been working on Marvel Snap ever since with Chinese outfit Nuverse, the gaming arm of TikTok owner Bytedance.


Snap's focus is on short, unique matches which "cut out the fluff" and last around three minutes total. Player decks are smaller - 15 cards or fewer - and both players act simultaneously, rather than waiting for the other person to finish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System of a Down singer Serj Tankian has joined the growing selection of artists contributing to upcoming music-themed first-person shooter Metal: Hellsinger.


Metal: Hellsinger, which was revealed back in June 2020, is the work of developer The Outsiders - the studio co-founded by former Battlefield 3 lead designer and Payday 2 director David Goldfarb - and promises to developer plenty of furious gun-based demon-slaying, all synced up to a metal soundtrack.


Each of the game's stages will feature its own track, with the player's power increasing - alongside the complexity of the music, from atmospheric background ambience all the way up to big metal anthems - if they manage to keep their attacks timed to the beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we're talking PlayStation Plus Premium, and our thoughts on whether it's worth the price based on what we know so far. 

The thing is, there are still several questions about what it will provide - even now, less than a week away from its initial rollout in Asia. What is its full game list? How good will its streaming be? And how soon should we expect newer games like Ratchet & Clank and Horizon Forbidden West to turn up on the service? 
The biggest difference between PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass is, of course, the lack of big new first-party games launching into Plus on day one. But, with Starfield's delay to 2023, Microsoft might not have any on Game Pass this year either. How will Xbox counter? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

Arizona man Nathan Harris is trying to launch the suit, which claims Hearthstone tricks players into non-refundable purchases without knowing the odds of rare cards (thanks, Polygon). 


In particular, Harris complains that his daughter - who used his credit card without asking - did not realise you could not get a refund from packs which "almost never received any valuable cards". The game also lacks parental controls, Harris complained.

"As a business leader it's exceptionally difficult to navigate highly politicised issues like transgender and abortion rights. But I'm not content to sit back and say or do nothing," he tweeted, before sharing an in-depth message he had sent out to his employees.
This message reads: "It is appalling that states, including the [Certain Affinity] headquarters' home state of Texas, are wading into what I consider personal health and privacy matters. Recently this encompassed gross intrusions on the rights and dignity of transgender youth, putting politics over the physical and emotional health and wellbeing of a vulnerable population, and threatening their families, friends, doctors and other supporters.

The show's debut episode, which is called "Onto the Icy Blue", introduces us to a boy named Alec. During his youth, Alec was led to believe that Pokémon and people could not live peacefully together. This is due to the Pokémon's powers, which the humans fear. However, when an older and wiser Alec goes to visit his father the Hisui region (of Arceus fame), he starts to look back on his childhood and recalls an encounter with a wild and (characteristically) timid Zorua. 
It is a short but adorable watch, and perfect to enjoy with a nice cup of tea. So, that's your cue. Pop the kettle on, then come back and settle on in with the first episode, which can be watched below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new mod for God of War shows off something I never imagined - but now I've seen it, I can't take my eyes off it: Homer and Bart Simpson stepping into the shoes of Kratos and Atreus. 
Oh, and you know The Stranger (wink wink) we all meet at the beginning of the game - well, thanks to this mod, he becomes the Hi-diddly-hoing Ned Flanders.
The mod comes from Omega Fantasy (via IGN) and uses the character models from 2003's The Simpson's Hit and Run. And to be honest, if all this mod did was swap out God of War's characters for those from Hit and Run, it would have still been an incredibly amusing watch.

But now, players have also found a questionable method of farming XP - in King Kong's private parts. 


A clip posted on the Warzone subreddit shows a player flying a helicopter toward's King Kong's giant testicles (which is easier said than done as Kong tends to crush anyone that heads towards him).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has responded to the recent terrorist attack in Buffalo that resulted in the deaths of ten people and the injury of three others by announcing a new charity initiative and pledging to bolster its ongoing efforts "to maintain safe and anti-racist spaces" within its community.


"On Saturday, 14th May, a young white man drove hours from his home to a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, and opened fire in a crowded supermarket, killing ten people and maiming three others," Bungie said in a statement. "It has since been confirmed that this was an act of terror aimed at Black Americans and is being investigated as a hate crime. Our hearts go out to the victims of this tragedy, and anyone impacted by this act of violence."


The studio, in collaboration with its Black at Bungie inclusion club, has announced a number of initiatives in response to the attack. It will, for instance, donate all profits made through the sale of its Be Heard collectable pin over the next 12 months to the Southern Poverty Law Center - a charity whose work includes "monitoring hate groups and other extremists throughout the United States and exposing their activities to the public, the media, and law enforcement."

In a blog post, DICE explained the removal of 128-player Breakthrough lobbies was necessary to increase "the value and impact of an individual player", as they currently were full of "intensity and chaos".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amanita Design - the developer behind the acclaimed likes of Samorost, Machinarium, Creaks, and last year's surreal horror Happy Games - has unveiled its latest project: "hand-crafted" dystopian adventure Phonopolis.
Phonopolis, which makes use of actual corrugated cardboard sets and a 12fps stop-motion animation style inspired by classic animated films, casts players as Felix, a thoughtful young man who must try and stop the titular city's authoritarian leader from playing the Absolute tone - an occurrence that would effectively cause Felix and his fellow citizens to lose their humanity.
What follows is a story-driven puzzle adventure encompassing "relatable, real-world themes", including manipulation and individualism. That doesn't mean it'll be heavy going, though; Amanita says Phonopolis will explore its subject matter in a "playful and light-hearted" way.

Word of a PlayStation 5 remake for The Last of Us first surfaced in April 2021 when Bloomberg reported the project had initially been in the works at Sony's San Diego-based Visual Arts Service Group before Naughty Dog was asked to take over. Further evidence of the project's existence emerged earlier this year, when a member of Naughty Dog's QA team listed an "unannounced remake" on their resumé - a reference since removed.


Yet while there's still no official word on a Last of Us remake, rumours of the project continue to swirl, with ever-leaky GamesBeat reporter Jeff Grubb now claiming it's set for a 2022 release.

Headhunter - a "stylised and colourful, third-person co-op action adventure" that was announced last November - initially looked like it would be the sixth entry in the celebrated series, following on from SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Heist, SteamWorld Dig 2, and SteamWorld Quest. That may no longer be the case, however.


According to Thunderful's latest earnings report (thanks IGN), Headhunter, which is now scheduled for a 2023 release, won't be the only SteamWorld title coming that year. An accompany release schedule reveals that Thunderful has three additional, currently unannounced SteamWorld games in development, with two of those also due in 2023.

Roller Champions, if you're unfamiliar, is Ubisoft's stab at creating the kind of knockabout sports mash-up that's made Rocket League such a perennial favourite, playing out like a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football - wherein two teams of three hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another and score a goal.


Is it any good? Time will tell, but Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was pretty impressed when he played an early version shortly after its E3 2019 unveiling, calling it "honestly one of the demos I found hardest to tear myself away from."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Spiders' scrappy but enjoyable RPG GreedFall is getting a sequel, and it'll be launching for PC and unspecified consoles in 2024. Or next year - publisher Nacon's press release and YouTube description currently disagree, which I'm trying to get to the bottom of.


When the original GreedFall launched in 2019, its combination of RPG action and BioWare-style player choice struck a bit of a chord despite its unavoidable rough edges, quickly raising its profile through plenty of positive word of mouth - ultimately, to the tune of over 2m sales - as players got stuck into its ambitious historical fantasy yarn.


"GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults," said Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfield in her review at the time, "and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced plans to accelerate the company's Road to Zero initiative, its plan to achieve carbon neutrality throughout its entire "value chain", by 10 years.
The Road to Zero plan was first concieved in 2010, when Sony announced it as a "a long-term global environmental plan... to realise a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of Sony's products and business activities". Originally, this target of carbon neutrality was set for 2050. However, today the company released a statement revealing a new target year of 2040.
"Sony will accelerate its target year for carbon neutrality, that is, greenhouse gas emissions of virtually zero, from 2050 to 2040. Specifically, Sony intends to make direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) of its own operations carbon neutral by 2030, and by 2040, in addition to scopes 1 and 2, Sony will also target other emissions originating from stages such as products, supply chains, and logistics (scope 3), aiming for net zero emissions achieved in all scopes."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I got to have a closer look at the Saints Row reboot from Volition. As you would expect, it looked bombastic and eclectic, with a myriad of unusual ideas that can only really be married together in a Saints Row game.
However, at this point, it also felt like Volition has focused a bit too much on adding in all this "stuff" to the game, and seemingly at the cost of some polish and finesse. Saints Row was confirmed to be a cross-gen release on its initial announcement last year, and that seems to be a fair market for it. Right now, it just looks and feels like more of a last-gen game than a current one.
Throughout the showcase, Saints Row's fighting appeared to be a touch clunky, while its cutscenes and dialogue felt more forced than we may expect from a game today. Meanwhile, during a close up of the Boss' face, you could clearly see that the character's eyelashes and eyelids did not match up in the way you would expect them to. This could be a bug that will be fixed by launch, but it was nonetheless jarring on the eye (mine, not the Boss', although their eye did look jarred as well).

We covered a broad range of topics, including plenty on what's new for this entry, but we started by discussing why Saints Row aficionados should come back to the series, despite its brand-new cast and setting. 


"It definitely still feels like Saints Row - even if it's not the same characters, even if it's not the same setting, even if it's not exactly the same as before - it feels like Saints Row," Lindgren said.


"I feel that every single time I go into the game, whether that's just customisation (because customisation is a huge part of it), whether that's travelling around the city, whether that's wing suiting and doing the missions, it feels like Saints Row. And I think that's at least worth checking out if you're an older player, but also for a newer player to discover that feeling for the first time."

Yes, that's right, the game is getting remastered. And, not only that, it is also coming to even more consoles than before.

His game allows you to conjur glowing musical notes in mid-air and send them flinging towards an enemy. If you've seen the new Doctor Strange, you'll likely recognise that description - since a short sequence in the film sees Benedict Cumberbatch doing just that.

Kubernetes v1.24 introduces a new alpha-level feature that prevents unauthorised users
from modifying the volume mode of a PersistentVolumeClaim created from an
existing VolumeSnapshot in the Kubernetes cluster.
The problem
The Volume Mode determines whether a volume
is formatted into a filesystem or presented as a raw block device.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

When leveraging the above capability, there is…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Elden Ring on Game Boy to that Advance Wars/Mass Effect mash-up, demakes are all the rage these days - and now it's classic first-person puzzler Portal's turn to get the retro port treatment, courtesy of a new fan project to rebuild it for N64.


Portal, of course, released back in 2007 as part of Valve's legendary Orange Box collection, where it immediately wrought cake memes, Companion Cubes and iconic antagonist GLaDOS upon an unsuspecting world. It also proved to be an ingenious puzzler beneath all that - tasking players with manipulating portals to navigate increasingly devious challenges - and one that still holds up wonderfully today.


The currently in-development Portal demake, officially known as Portal 64, is the work of developer James Lambert, and is ambitiously attempting to pack the entire experience of Valve's classic - memes, portals, puzzles, and all - down onto Nintendo hardware that preceded its release by over a decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following recent reports that Sony is refusing to approve any statements from PlayStation studios relating to reproductive rights, Bungie - whose acquisition by Sony was announced in February - has said "there will never be a 'muzzle' big enough to stop us from standing up for what's right".
Bungie was one of the first studios to speak out in support of Roe v Wade, a key judgement which legalised abortion across the US, following recent reports the US Supreme Court was trying to overturn the ruling. At the time, the developer called the move a "direct attack on human rights", adding that "standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values".
However, in light of reports that Sony is refusing to authorise any public statements its PlayStation studios might want to make around the issue of reproductive rights, some Bungie fans have questioned whether the developer will still be able to express its opinion so freely once its acquisition by Sony is complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer The Bearded Ladies, the studio behind 2018's acclaimed turn-based strategy adventure Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, has unveiled Miasma Chronicles - a new tactical RPG that's heading to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 some time next year.


Miasma Chronicles unfolds in a United States torn apart by a force known only as the Miasma, some time in the "not-too-distant future". Here, in the mining town of Sedentary, we meet our protagonist Elvis, a young man raised by a robotic older "brother" after being left by his mother. 


Elvis, for reasons both unknown and extremely convenient as far as gameplay goes, has access to a mysterious glove that enables him to control Miasma - a device that'll almost certainly prove useful as the brothers set out across the post-apocalyptic wasteland in search of answers that might "change the course of human history forever."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Bohemia Interactive has, following an extensive leak over the weekend, officially unveiled Arma Reforger, the next step in its long-running first-person military shooter series. Described as the "first milestone on the long road to Arma 4", Reforger launches into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access today.


Bohemia opened a lengthy livestream earlier today with confirmation that the long-awaited Arma 4 is in development (its predecessor, Arma 3, celebrates its 10th birthday next year), but the remainder of the stream's focus was very much on Reforger. It's being called a new standalone "platform" for the series, consisting of several key parts; there's a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.


Reforger's sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia's previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer's latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.

While not yet confirmed by developer Epic Games, eagle-eyed Fortnite leakers are confident this season will end in another of the game's eye-catching live events - the first of 2022 - likely on Saturday, 4th June.


This afternoon, Epic itself issued a typically cryptic teaser with snippets of audio and an unmistakable logo at the end: the fan-favourite Mech (or Mecha Team Leader, to give its full name) which duelled and ultimately beat Fortnite's Devourer monster in one of the game's most memorable moments back in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[May's second crop of games headed to Xbox Game Pass includes Jurassic World Evolution 2, available today, plus Sniper Elite 5 and Pac-Man Museum+.


Jurassic World Evolution 2 is the dinosaur management sim sequel which adds in plenty of new features and creatures, including flying and airborne reptiles. 


Developer Frontier last year admitted the game had under-performed, something it blamed on the delay of the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion movie, now due in June. Here's hoping Xbox Game Pass gives it fresh legs.

In a blog post acknowledging the continued issue and the ongoing "frustration within the community" it said it had felt too, Amazon announced it had permanently banned "several million accounts that participated in botting, hacking or gold-selling".


"Since Lost Ark launched, we've been fighting a war against the bots infiltrating Arkesia," Amazon dramatically wrote. "Addressing bots can be especially challenging in free-to-play games because it's so easy to create an account and enter the game, but we're working on multiple fronts to fight them."

Speaking to IGN, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he had "heard the frustration" surrounding the game from fans who felt sidelined, and who have campaigned for more content using the hashtag #SaveRedDeadOnline. 


"Rockstar Games talks about the updates that are coming, and we're working on an awful lot at Rockstar Games," Zelnick said. "I've heard the frustration, it's flattering that they want more content, and more will be said by Rockstar in due time."

The new sales milestone was announced today via the official Final Fantasy 15 Twitter account.


While a sizable number, it's interesting to compare it to the 11.8m copies sold by the Square Enix-published Rise of the Tomb Raider, launched back in 2015, or the 14.5m copies sold by the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot - especially in light of Square Enix ditching its western game studios, such as Tomb Raider's Crystal Dynamics.

The sale to Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive marks another studio gone from Improbable, as it ditches its previous designs on video game development backed by its ever-nebulous SpatialOS cloud technology.

As a result of the sale, Scavengers' console versions - currently being tested via a closed alpha - have been cancelled, Eurogamer has been told. Its PC version currently remains alive, as a small internal team keeps it operational.

Multiversus was officially unveiled last November following a string of leaks, and now, after and a steady stream of reveals focused on its increasingly proposterous character roster - where the likes of Game of Thrones' Arya Stark can battle against Scooby Doo's Shaggy - it finally enters invite-only closed alpha later this week.


Multiversus' closed alpha runs from 19th-27th May, giving participants access to 15 playable fighters, seven maps, and a selection of different modes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spacefaring sim sequel Kerbal Space Program 2 - which has faced repeated delays since its unveiling in 2019 - has been delayed yet again, and is now expected to arrive in "early 2023" on PC, with a console release to follow later in that year.


Kerbal Space Program 2 was first confirmed to be in development during Gamescom 2019, where it slapped with what would prove to be an extremely optimistic 2020 release date. Publisher Private Division later adjusted that to "fiscal 2021" - sometime between April 2020 and March 2021 - and then pushed it back once again to autumn 2021.


That still wasn't the end of the delays, however; as 2020 drew to a close, developer Intercept Games revealed it had made the decision to postpone release yet again, this time to some nebulous point in 2022, citing the "immense technical and creative challenge" of developing the sequel. And now, Kerbal Space Program 2's release has shifted once more.

Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, which was announced back in June 2020 well before Cyberpunk 2077's troubled launch, is a 10-episode collaboration between CD Projekt and Japanese animation studio Trigger, which has previously worked on Little Witch Academia and Kill la Kill.


At the time of its announcement, CD Projekt said the series would follows the adventures of a street kid trying to survive in a technology- and body-modification-obsessed city of the future. "Having everything to lose," went the official blurb, "he chooses to stay alive by becoming an edgerunner — a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a controversial email last week, in which PlayStation boss Jim Ryan asked staff to "respect differences of opinion" on abortion rights, a new report has claimed Sony is currently refusing to approve any statements its PlayStation studios might want to make on the topic of reproductive rights in response to the US Supreme Court's proposal to reverse the ruling of Roe v Wade, with Insomniac head Ted Price going as far as to tell staff he believed there would be "material repercussions" if it went against Sony's wishes.


According to a new report by The Washington Post, Spider-Man and Ratchet & Clank developer Insomniac, which was acquired by Sony in 2020, had made the decision to donate $50,000 USD to the Women's Reproductive Rights Assistance Project (WRRAP) following the US Supreme Court's recent proposal to reverse Roe v Wade, a key judgement which legalised abortion across the country - a donation Sony has agreed to match, along with any additional donations from staff, as part of company's "PlayStation Cares" programme.


However, according to the Washington Post, Sony won't authorise any public statement Insomniac might want to make about reproductive rights or its donation, and staff have been expressly forbidden from mentioning either Sony or Insomniac in any retweet should the WRRAP choose to make an announcement about the donation. "[Sony Interactive Entertainment] will not approve ANY statements from any studio on the topic of reproductive rights," Insomniac head Ted Price told studio employees in an email dated 13th May. "We fought hard for this and we did not win.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knockout battle royale game Fall Guys is going free-to-play from 21st June, developer Mediatonic has announced. Additionally, the shift in monetisation model will coincide with the game's long-awaited release on Switch and Xbox, as well as the arrival of a new PlayStation 5 version, and its debut on the Epic Games Store.


As part of its transition to free-to-play, Fall Guys - which celebrates its second birthday later this year - will be hitting the reset button, and 21st June will see it re-launching with a new season that Mediatonic is referring to as Season 1: Free For All, promising "stacks of new challenges and rewards".


As with Rocket League before it, which similarly went free-to-play after being snapped up by Epic Games, Fall Guys will be adapting a monetisation model that'll be immediately familiar to Fortnite players. That means the arrival of a new paid premium Season Pass - purchasable with a new in-game currency known as Show-Bucks - that'll sit alongside the existing free tier.

In the UK, players will actually see a saving - the price here has dropped from £16 to £13 - and in Canada, it's jumped a little from $22CAD to $27CAD.

As first reported by Windows Central, Atlus has circulated a consumer survey to players asking a whole slew of questions about their gaming preferences.

Producer and director, Naoki Yoshida, confirmed that, while "extensive and persistent", the errors will  be resolved when the game goes into maintenance mode tomorrow, 16th May. 

It's taken a full month to fix the issue, though. Back in April, Yoshida apologised to players for ongoing issues with the MMORPG's new housing lottery system that prevented players from winning any land. Writing on the official website, he explain what the team was doing to address a problem in which players were being told their bids were unsuccessful because there "were no participants in this lottery", or that the winning number was "0"... even though no players can be assigned that number.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Bohemia Interactive dropped a save the date for "Future of Arma", an upcoming livestream set to reveal what's next for the tactical military shooter.

Earlier today, however, an alleged marketing and brand guide leaked online, revealing that a new multi-platform instalment, Arma Reforger, is on the way to PC. It looks like it's set to come to Xbox and PlayStation consoles, too, although the wording is a tad confusing, so it's possible the PS4 and PS5 release will come "in the future".

The leak intimates that the company is set to announce Arma 4 alongside Reforger, which has been called a "more focused" title that will "introduce Arma to a new console-oriented audience" with a "very strong multiplayer focus" that will "test new technology and design decisions to form the foundation for Arma 4."

The news came as part of the company's recent financial presentation, which revealed that one of Square Enix's "medium-term business strategy" initiatives is to "boost game development capabilities by establishing new studios, [mergers and acquisitions], etc."

As spotted by Axios' Stephen Totilo (thanks, NME), the company also revealed that the "objectives behind divestiture of select overseas studios and IP" - that is, the reason why it sold off its three western studios - was to "achieve sustained growth through selection and concentration of company sources, better align overseas publishing function with organisation in Tokyo, and transform group business portfolio".

In an interview with VentureBeat, Fils-Aimé confirmed that a developer rarely "makes a conscious decision not to continue supporting" a franchise, stating that - "at least during [his] tenure" - Nintendo is always experimenting with ways to make new games… or apply new ideas to an existing franchise. 

"Why was F-Zero abandoned?" he said. "The insight I would share is that, at least during my tenure, Nintendo developers were always experimenting with different gameplay styles, always thinking about where a unique experience could be applied back, either to an existing franchise or maybe creating a new franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's all go for American Truck Simulator; not only does SCS Software currently have its hands full working on its previously announced Montana and Texas expansions, the developer has also been beavering away on its major California overhaul - and phase two of that work is now available in a new update.


California was, of course, one of two states included at American Truck Simulator's launch back in 2016 (the other being Nevada), and has been starting to show in age in recent times, particularly alongside SCS' increasingly impressive work on newer state expansions.


As such, the developer pledged a refresh for the ageing location back in 2020, with the aim of bringing it up to current mapping standards. The first phase of this rework arrived last July, making significant changes to California's northern road network, adding (and in a few cases, removing) scenery towns, and introducing Border Protection Stations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If this week's two previously announced Epic Games Store freebies somehow aren't enough to be getting on with, Epic has also, rather unexpectedly, thrown in a third offering - taking the form of developer 34BigThings' blisteringly fast, wonderfully stylish anti-grav racer Redout.


Redout initially launched all the way back in 2016, immediately dazzling with its gorgeous, high-speed racing, and did well enough that it was followed up by no less than five expansions, introducing a host of new courses to sate those smitten with its core action.


The free Epic Store version doesn't include all those post-launch goodies, but it does deliver 11 event types across 25 tracks and five locations, alongside a robust career mode, extensive customisation, and online multiplayer for up to 12 racers. Which, to be honest, should be more than enough to keep you amused if this is your first time in Redout's world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game grading company Wata Games is the target of a new US class action lawsuit accusing it of unfair business practices and of manipulating the retro gaming market for its own gain.


As reported by VGC, the lawsuit was filed on 10th May in the Central District of California, representing class members (estimated to be as many as 10,000 individuals) who all paid for game grading and other services by Wata. It accuses Wata of "engaging in affirmative acts to manipulate the retro video game market" and of "engaging in unfair business practices", specifically pointing the figure at Wata president and CEO Deniz Kahn.

Kahn is accused of working with auction house Heritage Auctions co-founder Jim Halperin - a previous Wata investor and advisory board member - to manipulate the retro games market through promotional efforts and media interviews, in which the pair are said to have claimed that retro games prices would continue to rise.

Speaking to Fast Company, Epic boss Tim Sweeney said the release would allow "the full capabilities that you've seen [in Unreal Engine] opened up so that anybody can build very high-quality game content and code... and deploy it into Fortnite without having to do a deal with us - it's open to everybody".


Fortnite already has a Creative mode where you can build your own Fortnite island or mini-game using Epic-designed props and game design options. But collaborations with brands and monetisation of content has remained controlled by Epic itself.

The programme will once again run for two months this summer, with applications now open, exclusively to those from ethnic minorities who live in the UK. 


As we wrote last year when launching the scheme initially, the games media has a diversity problem and Eurogamer is no exception. It is on us to help affect change and continue improving representation, so that the games media better reflects the gaming community as a whole.

Starship Troopers: Terran Command is a traditional-looking real-time strategy game set in the Starship Troopers universe. As you'd expect, you take command of the mobile infantry and go to war against the Arachnid threat.


The video below shows how this plays out in the game - you generate troops, troops and more troops, who gain experience and battlefield prowess as they eradicate the enemy. The trick is keeping experienced troops alive long enough to get truly powerful. Once the last soldier in a squad is killed, that squad is toast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Slitherine has shown off half an hour of upcoming real-time tactics game Stargate: Timekeepers, while confirming plans to release a beta to coincide with the much-loved SG1 TV series' 25th anniversary in July.


The video, below, shows the Stargate: Timekeepers segment of Slitherine's Home of Wargamers event. It debuts the In Plain Site mission, in which the Stargate team, including sniper Max Bolton and technical officer Sam Watson, attempt to put down a sacrifice ritual inside the Jaffa village by disguising themselves as the enemy.


The stealth heavy Stargate: Timekeepers, developed by Creative Forge Games (Hard West, Phantom Doctrine), looks heavily inspired by the Commandos series (this is not a guns blazing type of game). The campaign departs from the end of season seven of the Stargate SG-1 main plot with an original story starting during the Battle of Antarctica. It unfolds over 14 missions, each of which lasts around an hour, and revolves around unravelling a timeloop mystery and defeating the Goa'uld threat.

With Kubernetes 1.24 the gRPC probes functionality entered beta and is available by default.
Now you can configure startup, liveness, and readiness probes for your gRPC app
without exposing any HTTP endpoint, nor do you need an executable. Kubernetes can natively connect to your your workload via gRPC and query its status.
Some history
It's useful to let the system managing your workload check that the app is
healthy, has started OK, and whether the app considers itself good to accept
traffic. Before the gRPC support was added, Kubernetes already allowed you to
check for health based on running an executable from inside the container image,
by making an HTTP request, or by checking whether a TCP connection succeeded.
For most apps, those checks are enough.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 2018, developer Remedy Entertainment announced it was working to adapt its beloved supernatural horror adventure Alan Wake for television - and now, some four years later, it finally has an update on the project, announcing it's partnering with The Walking Dead network AMC to bring the show to life.


Alan Wake, for the uninitiated, debuted on Xbox 360 back in 2010, and its small-town horror, in which the titular novelist battles supernatural forces armed with little more than a flashlight and an endless urge to monologue, quickly gained cult classic status. But while all was quiet on the Alan front for over a decade, he's had something of a resurgence in recent times.


Alongside a prominent role in Remedy's acclaimed Control - specifically in its second DLC, known as AWE - Alan Wake was given the remaster treatment in 2021 (a release now confirmed for Switch) and will be getting a long-awaited sequel some time next year. As such, a TV series expanding Alan's reach still further seems like the next logical step for Remedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been pining for the return of Ubisoft's impressively enduring Rabbids ahead of their flagship appearance in this year's Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope on Switch, you're in luck: Ubisoft has announced it'll be giving its previously China-exclusive game Rabbids: Adventure Party a global release at some point before the end of next month.


Rabbids: Adventure Party initially launched for Switch in 2020, sending the titular nuisances back in time for some hijinks inspired by classic Chinese novel Journey to the West - and for some minigame action played using the Switch's Joy-Con controllers.


There'll be a number of notable changes for Rabbids: Adventure Party come its global release, however. For starters, according to Ubisoft's latest earnings report, it'll be getting a new name, becoming the slightly less catchy Rabbids: Party of Legends, and will be branching out onto other platforms in addition to Switch - namely Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Stadia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space fans eager to get their hands on EA Motive's promising remake of developer Visceral Games' much-loved sci-fi horror classic now have a date to scrawl in their diaries; EA has confirmed it'll be releasing for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 27th January next year.


Announced last July, the Dead Space remake is a ground-up reworking of the 2008 original, promising to raise "the level of horror and immersion to unprecedented heights". Of course, players still step into the shoes of engineer Isaac Clarke as they take their terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura - battling the nightmarish necromorphs along the way - but EA Motive's version promises to bring enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks include improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Following the remake's official unveiling, EA Motive has given Dead Space fans a surprisingly thorough behind-the-scenes look at its development, revealing more on its gameplay changes, audio, and art across three separate livestreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake Remastered, the spruced-up version of developer Remedy's cult-classic action-horror, is officially launching on Switch this autumn. Additionally, the developer has offered an update on its long-awaited Alan Wake 2, saying it has made the decision to delay the larger reveal it had originally told fans to expect this summer.


Alan Wake Remastered - which bundles together the base game plus its two expansions, The Signal and The Writer - launched for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last October, giving Remedy's much-loved original a welcome modern-day makeover with the likes of richer environmental detail and enhanced character models.


A Switch version of Alan Wake Remastered wasn't previously been announced by Remedy, but a surprise listing pointing to a release on Nintendo's platform was spotted on the Brazilian ratings board website last September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're talking FIFA - or from next year, EA Sports FC. The breakup of FIFA and EA has sparked numerous headlines this week, as both sides have claimed the deal is good for them.

On EA's part, it has said freedom from the FIFA organisation will allow it to do far more with its football game.  (It will also, of course, save the hefty sum it paid for those four letters on the front of its box.) As for FIFA, it has said its brand is the thing that matters, and it'll be fine without EA. Indeed, to quote FIFA president Gianni Infantino, "the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST". So there's that.
But behind all the bluster, what do we think EA Sports FC will really look like in future? And does FIFA stand any chance of coming up with a rival game developed in time for next year? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan, plus resident footy fan Wesley Yin-Poole.

Support for these games - which was expected, but still not yet dated - will arrive "in the coming weeks", The Pokémon Company said today. 


It sounds like Arceus' story and mechanics have prompted a few workarounds to the normal Home formula - as already supported in Pokémon Sword/Shield, Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee and Pokémon Go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games, the developer behind MOBA League of Legends, is suing ByteDance's Shanghai Moonton Technology Co. LTD, the developer behind MOBA Mobile Legends for copyright.
The lawsuit, which was filed by Riot's parent company Tencent, reads: "This action seeks to stop Moonton from continuing its deliberate and sustained campaign to free ride on Riot's highly valuable rights in the mobile video game League of Legends: Wild Rift and related content." The company goes on to call Moonton's strategy "blatant copying".
The lawsuit continues, "Over the years, as Riot updated its video game, Moonton would copy it. When Riot updated the game's promotional materials, Moonton copied them. And when Riot released a new trailer, Moonton copied it. This is a critical issue for Riot.

The Smash Bros-style fighter will arrive on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, published by Bandai Namco. 


The idea here is to battle - solo or with up to eight players (four on PlayStation) - and collect minifigures which you can then customise to create your own hero of choice. You can then take said hero and attempt to tackle the game's global leaderboards.

The group, part of contracted game services company Keywords Studios, were recently told they would need to begin working in BioWare's offices full-time from this week. This sparked calls of unfairness from Keywords staff, who compared their lot to BioWare's own staff - who are allowed a hybrid work from home option. 


Keywords workers have now been told they can continue to work from home "until further notice", The Verge reported.

The Japanese publisher had a record revenue of 299.5bn yen last financial year, an increase of almost 10 percent (9.9). Operating profit was a record 74.4bn yen.


The vast majority of that revenue came from the Digital Entertainment sector: 215bn yen. But without Metal Gear or Silent Hill, Konami has barely released any games, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew Assassin's Creed Valhalla was doing well - but it's still doing well now, 18 months later.


New data released by Ubisoft last night as part of its annual financial results revealed Valhalla had more unique players in the past 12 months ending 31st March 2022 than it did in the four months after its hugely-successful launch. 


The stat suggests players are still picking up - and sticking with - Valhalla. Indeed, Ubisoft also said that the past year - free from a new Assassin's Creed release - notched up nearly double the money than the year after 2018's Odyssey arrived. That points to stronger sales of Valhalla's DLC than Odyssey's, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a report last month that Ubisoft had attracted early takeover interest from several private equity firms, the Assassin's Creed publisher has once again addressed the issue, saying it has "everything we need to remain independent."


Ubisoft initially discussed the subject of buyouts back in February, following a round of acquisitions that saw Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, Sony buying Bungie, and Take-Two buying Zynga. Since then, however, a report from Bloomberg claimed Ubisoft had attracted preliminary interest from a number of private equity firms, although it was said the publisher had yet to enter into "serious negotiations" regarding such a deal.


In light of those reports, Ubisoft has once again addressed the subject of acquisitions, albeit in very much the same terms it did back in February. "There've been a lot of talks around consolidation in the industry, and in Ubisoft in particular," company chairman Yves Guillemont said during the publisher's latest earnings call, adding that its "overall position is clear."

Ubisoft's pirate ship battler - a spin-off from 2013 Assassin's Creed game Black Flag - has been repeatedly delayed, though test footage leaked late last month suggested a launch was now finally on the horizon. Today, Ubisoft reconfirmed it would indeed see the light of day this financial year (before 1st April 2023). 


Also up this year, finally, is Ubisoft's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Developed by The Division studio Massive Entertainment, it was first announced more than five years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember last week when we reported on the video showing one The Last of Us Part 2 fan trying to rewrite the game's narrative using mods? Well, they have done it again, and this time discovered the zebra that Abby and her father take care of in Salt Lake City is actually invincible (for which I am quite relieved - this game has enough bloodshed as it is).
In the second episode of Speclizer's myth busting series, the creator used a series of gunshots and explosives to see if the zebra would meet its demise. However, that lady is a hardy one, and if anything, she only looks mildly disgruntled as the bomb blasts go off around her (which, you know, seems fair).
Another amusing discovery comes from the snowy streets of Jackson. This time, it is Ellie in the control seat, and she is pissed at the community's annoying kids for trying to best her in a snowball fight. However, no matter how far Ellie goes from that play area, she will still be hit over and over again by the white stuff. In the words of Speclizer, "the kids have aimbot".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It wasn't long ago that developer Respawn Entertainment's confirmed its free-to-play battle royale shooter Apex Legends would finally be making its debut on mobile devices this May - and now the developer has gone one better, confirming it'll be heading to iOS and Android next Tuesday, 17th May.


Apex Legends' move to mobile was made official last April, when Respawn confirmed it would be a completely separate entity to its console and PC counterparts, meaning players should expect unique battle passes, even mobile-only maps and gameplay - although no cross-play. It also promises to tailor the experience specifically for mobile devices with the likes of streamlined controls for touchscreens.


Apex Legends Mobile has been available to select players for some time now, having entered regional testing earlier this year, but Respawn has now confirmed its ready to roll out the experience globally, with its full iOS and Android launch now set for next Tuesday, 17th May.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mini Motorways, the acclaimed road-building strategy sim from developer Dinosaur Polo Club, has made the leap to Switch and will be available via the console's eShop from today, 11th May.


As you might have already twigged, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club's celebrated underground railway builder Mini Metro, and delivers an equally minimalist, equally excellent, spin on its predecessor's tactile strategy action.


In Mini Motorways, each level takes loose inspiration from a real-world city, and the goal is to construct as efficient a road network as possible, placing down the likes of traffic lights, bridges, and roads to ensure commuters are able to reach their destination within the allotted time. New building items are awarded each in-game week, enabling your urban expansion to continue unfettered - until you make a mistake and your best laid plans end in chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Georgetown has a <a href="https://americandragnet.org/">new report</a> on the highly secretive bulk surveillance activities of ICE in the US:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you think about government surveillance in the United States, you likely think of the National Security Agency or the FBI. You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don&#8217;t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE&#8217;s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government&#8217;s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has &#8212; without any judicial, legislative or public oversight &#8212; reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver&#8217;s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Speaking to The New York Times, EA boss Andrew Wilson said a lot of the company's motivation was to improve players' experiences without being pigeonholed.
"It was really about how can we do more for the players, more for the fans, how can we offer them more modalities to play," he said. "How can we bring more partners into the game, how can we expand beyond the bounds of the traditional game."

Yesterday, fan gossip was sparked by the description of a poster on the BioWare store. The poster is a print of the teaser image BioWare released last November for its in-development Mass Effect game, and was described thus: "While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what's next."


This description (which was later corrected to remove Shepard's name) was enough to spark YouTube videos, as well as articles from various blogs and websites. And, of course, the fire was only fuelled further by BioWare's later correction.

Alongside those, EA also has its upcoming (and final) FIFA game and Madden NFL 23 set for this autumn, before NHL 23 and the long-awaited Need for Speed turn up before Christmas. So, what could those mystery games be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has committed itself to sticking with Battlefield - and the beleagured Battlefield 2042 in particular - albeit with a new development process rethought "from the ground up". 


Speaking to investors last night, EA boss Andrew Wilson said the publisher was taking "the long view" when it came to the franchise, and that it would remain a big part of EA for the forseeable future.


Wilson praised former Respawn boss Vince Zampella in his new expanded role in which he also oversees some Battlefield development, and also promised EA would continue to "grow" Battlefield 2042 - after righting its ship first.

Back in March we reported the game had sold 12m copies in just over two weeks, an incredible launch for the game.



The new figure was revealed in publisher Bandai Namco's earnings report that takes us up to the end of March, meaning global sales will have exceeded that 13.4m.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following EA's announcement that it will be ditching the FIFA brand and renaming its long-running football series EA Sports FC starting in 2023, FIFA President Gianni Infantino has responded, insisting, "the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans."


That comes alongside FIFA's announcement it'll be adopting a non-exclusive licensing model for games based on its brand moving forward, and that it's currently working with third-party studios and publishers to developer new projects. This, it says, will enable it to provide "more choice for football and gaming fans in the lead-up to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and FIFA Women's World Cup Australia & New Zealand 2023."


Now that its partnership with EA is officially over, FIFA says it's already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024. Before that, however, it'll be launching a number of "non-simulation games" with the initial selection due to release in the third quarter of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grounded, developer Obsidian's inch-high garden survival adventure, has just dropped another update on the road to its Version 1.0 release later this year, introducing what sounds like a sort of on-demand horde mode for players wishing to farm and battle particular enemies.


As explained in a new developer video, the idea behind Grounded's Bugs Strike Back update is to introduce - in "true Obsidian fashion" - Faction Reactivity. Essentially, the more players bother specific bug types in their quest for new materials - whether that be by killing them outright or merely invading their territory - the more likely those creatures will be to storm player bases to try and exact revenge.


While that'll happen automatically during play, those looking for a more on-demand-style experience can take advantage of two additional features. There's the new Waft Emitter device that enables players to summon specific bug types to a location for some wave-based mayhem by jamming in parts stolen from their downed brethren. The more parts used, the more intense the ensuing battle will be so players are recommended to proceed cautiously.

Designed in partnership with the disability community, the new adaptive accessories consist of three main components - an Adaptive Mouse, Adaptive Buttons, and an Adaptive Hub - with the idea being that users can augment the first two devices with 3D printed accessories in order to customise mouse and keyboard inputs in a way that best suits their needs.


The new Adaptive Mouse, for instance, can be customised with a thumb support and tail extension - or 3D printed tails - as required, while the Adaptive Hub serves as a means of either replacing or augmenting a traditional keyboard.

That, though, isn't the end of the additions arriving in Monster Hunter Rise's "massive" Sunbreak expansion. As part of its latest reveal, Capcom has showcased three new monsters and discussed Sunbreak's flagship addition, Malzeno, in more detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After, let's be honest, a pretty long wait, Ubisoft has announced that The Division 2 will be getting a brand-new season.
The launch of season nine, which is known as Hidden Alliance will go live on 12th May and will add a new big bad to the game: Captain Lewis. As well as this hulking brute, there will also be four new mini bosses for players to square up against, or Lewis' "True sons" as Ubisoft calls them. 
This update will also introduce a new eight-player co-op mode called Countdown. As the name suggests, here players making up two teams will be given a 15-minute countdown to stabilize a power plant before it's locked down for good. The teams will be starting in different locations on the map and must work together to be victorious on their mission (so, you know, no pressure). You can check out the full season reveal below.

However, a group of scientists has taken this winning formula and now boosted it even further. How have they done this? Simply by letting your face and mouth also become part of the VR experience. And how have they chosen to demonstrate this new tech? Well - with, er, spiders.


Before we go on, let me quickly assure you that when I say spiders, I do not mean real spiders. Rather, just some small VR arachnids. So, once more to clarify, no real spiders (or people for that matter) were harmed in the making of this article. 


Anyway, back to the matter in hand.  A group of scientists from Carnegie Mellon University's Future Interfaces Group (via PC Gamer) have taken a standard Oculus Quest 2, and decked it out with a series of ultrasonic transducers.

But while that's a huge milestone - already 6m more than the Wii - Nintendo admitted its consoles sales were down 20 percent on last year, and blamed "shortages of semiconductor components and other parts". Last year's results were also boosted by the breakout popularity of Animal Crossing, Nintendo noted.


Nintendo Switch game sales saw no such slowdown. Software sales were up 1.8 percent year-on-year to 235m, meaning the past 12 months were the highest annual game sales figure ever recorded for a Nintendo platform.

In a report by The Washington Post, employees revealed Raven management held several meetings and town halls ahead of the workforce's upcoming vote to unionise. During one such town hall, held on 26th April, Raven management reportedly inferred that any unionisation within the company would "impede game development and affect promotions and benefits". Following this meeting, employees then received an email with an attachment that simply read "Please vote no".


However, these emails do not appear to have had the desired affect for AKB, as many employees still went on to vote 'Yes' on their ballot cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Wales Interactive has given a fresh airing to Sker Ritual - its co-op survival shooter follow-up to 2020's horror outing Maid of Sker - sharing new details and a first proper trailer.


The original Maid of Sker took its cue from Welsh folklore - retelling the supposedly true tale of Elizabeth Williams, said to have have died of a broken heart after being locked inside her home by her controlling father - and spun it into an richly atmospheric, if ultimately rather unadventurous slice of 19th stealth horror.


Follow-up Sker Ritual is quite a departure, however, switching out the methodical sneaking of its predecessor in favour of co-operative FPS action for up to four players as they try and "survive the onslaught and supernatural menace of the Quiet Ones".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Motive is readying to show more of its remake of Visceral Games' much-love sci-fi horror classic Dead Space, and will be shining a light (a small one obviously, so as not to ruin the gloomy ambience) on the game's art in a new livestream set to air this Thursday, 12th May.


This will be EA Motive's third developer livestream since the Dead Space remake's official unveiling last July, with the developer's first showing having focused on enhancements being made to the original's moody environments, zero-g traversal, and dismemberment and damage systems. Its second showcase, meanwhile, was all about audio.


EA's calling this third livestream Crafting the Tension, and promises a "deep dive into various aspects of the upcoming game’s art design". Specifically, it'll be talking about how it's using the power of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and modern PC hardware to "visually evolve and remake the original Dead Space's environments, characters, VFX, lighting and more from the ground up to create a new level of immersion and quality" for today’s audiences.

This year's Summer Games Done Quick serves up a week of speedrunning fun from Sunday, 26th June to 3rd July, and will feature more than 120 speedruns over its run-time, with all money raised during the show going to Doctors Without Borders.


As ever, this year's schedule is a pleasingly diverse thing, featuring retro classics, indie favourites, triple-A blockbusters, and a couple of oddities thrown in for good measure. The mighty Elden Ring is in there - perhaps inevitably given its speedrunning allure - and a further browse of the list reveals everything from Phasmophobia and Yakuza: Like a Dragon to Halo Infinite and McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure, all serving up various flavours of speedrun.

The latest comment on the matter - and the latest interview with Fils-Aimé as he promotes his new memoir - comes from Bloomberg, where the former exec stated for the first time that Mother 3's content was not the issue.


"That is not at all the issue why Mother 3 in particular never made it to the West," Fils-Aime said when asked about Mother 3's more sensitive topics. "It was all based on the business needs and the business situation at the time."

Well, that's what happened to the developers of Final Fantasy 16, when Bloodborne was first released. They pretty much had the exact same idea themselves, they say, but their game was cancelled before we got to hear about it. 

Writing in Japanese magazine Famitsu, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida detailed what could have been (via ResetEra). 

Yoshida and fellow Final Fantasy team members Hiroshi Takai and Hiroshi Minagawa reminisced about their previous game that was "basically Bloodborne", but before Bloodborne was even a thing.

<blockquote><p>Most email newsletters you get include an invisible &#8220;image,&#8221; typically a single white pixel, with a unique file name. The server keeps track of every time this &#8220;image&#8221; is opened and by which IP address. This quirk of internet history means that marketers can track exactly when you open an email and your IP address, which can be used to roughly work out your location.</p>
<p>So, how does Apple Mail stop this? By caching. Apple Mail downloads all images for all emails before you open them. Practically speaking, that means every message downloaded to Apple Mail is marked &#8220;read,&#8221; regardless of whether you open it. Apples also routes the download through two different proxies, meaning your precise location also can&#8217;t be tracked...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Publisher Bandai Namco shut down the servers, meaning PC players are unable to play the games online - a key part of the experience through invasions, summoning, and messages.

The game's site is now live and shows a digital clock perched atop a retro TV. Meanwhile, off to one side, there is a calendar couting down to 13th May. More interestingly (and also more strangely), the dials on the TV can actually be twiddled by clicking on them and, when done so, one of two videos will start playing.
The first video is mostly static with a few blurry and erratic shots thrown in here and there. Throughout, an unknown man chats a lot about "Doomsday" and states, "in short, we're being reborn... and you're involved." If that doesn't make a lot of sense to you right now, don't worry. It doesn't to us either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times has decided to remove today's intended Wordle answer, in case players thought its appearance was an attempt by the newspaper to reference a "major recent news event". 


We'll mention the word itself below.


However, the New York Times is unable to affect Wordle's list of upcoming answers (all pre-programmed into the game months in advance) if you do not refresh your browser window. This means some players will still see the removed word today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you think of Left 4 Dead, in general the image of a zombie comes to mind. However, if Gabe Newell had his way, this may not be the case, as the Valve president initially felt zombies were a bit cliché and "cheesy". 
Former Valve writer Chet Faliszek chatted about his time at the company with YouTube channel Kiwi Talkz (via VG247). Here, the writer revealed during the development of Left 4 Dead he, "went to dinner with Gabe and [Newell] was like 'if you look at zombie movies, Night Of The Living Dead is about racism, Dawn Of The Dead is about consumerism'".
When the Newell then asked Faliszek to explain "what his game was about", the writer replied: "well it's about working together, it's the game itself, it's a reflection of the game."

Essentially, players can watch specific Twitch streams to earn exclusive items to be used in-game. However, fans were frustrated and posted negative reviews for the game on Steam.


"In order to get these items... you have to watch hours and hours of inane Twitch streamers prattling on instead of actually playing the game you paid for. They also are timed so if you miss them you miss them forever," wrote one review. "If there was another way to earn these in-game it would not be a big deal but I'm not gonna watch ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Angry Joe for two hours just to get a weapon."

The Xbox Support Twitter account reported issues impacting the ability to launch Xbox games and play games via the Xbox Cloud on the evening of Friday 6th May, and then again on Saturday morning, and once more on Saturday night (UK times).


The outages have sparked a wave of complaints on social media, including from streamer and Xbox presenter Parris Lilly, who has called for greater transparency from Microsoft on how its digital rights management (DRM) policies work.

According to VentureBeat, this may be a stick or puck similar to Amazon and Roku devices, although there are also reports that an app for Samsung smart TVs is on the way, too, which is also expected to launch in the next year or so.

If true, it means players will not only be able to stream games to their PC and mobile devices, but also play them on TVs, all without the added expense of buying consoles or their expensive accessories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ron Gilbert has responded to fans unhappy with Return to Monkey Island's art style, stating "Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style you wanted or were expecting but it's the art style I wanted".

In a candid blog post, Gilbert said the game had "a team of incredible artists, animators, sound designers, programmers, and testers all pouring their souls into this game and it’s beautiful to see, play, and listen to".

As Victoria so perfectly summarised for us earlier this week, the Monkey Island series has taken on a new look as well as a new creative team in its third outing, The Curse of Monkey Island. However, this new art style was not simply because of the change in management behind the game's development but because of the tools being used behind the scenes, and not all fans are happy with the new look.

That's according to an eagle-eyed fan on Reddit (thanks, PCGN) who spotted that the PSN Store's listing of the game has been updated to state it supports "four network players".

Acutely aware that anyone can knock up a fake screenshot, I took the liberty of checking the PSN Store listing myself and yup, it's there in black and white, although the description itself curiously still says you can play "in solo-play or with one other hero and drop in on criminal activity wherever you find it".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' action RPG, saw its concurrent PC player count drop to just a single player on PC on Wednesday, 4th May, 2022.

It's yet another sign that the troubled game - which only released at the beginning of March - seemingly continues to struggle to maintain a player base on PC (Babylon's Fall is also out on PS4/5, but there's no similar way for us to monitor player counts for PlayStation consoles).

Just a couple of weeks back, we reported how SteamCharts - a site that, predictably enough, charts the performance of games on Steam - noted that in mid-April, global players on PC dropped below ten. Fast forward to May, and it looks as though like things are getting worse, with concurrent PC players failing to top 100 at all this week (thanks, VGC). Its highest ever peak sits at just 1166 players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission has fined Nvidia $5.5m USD for failing to properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on revenue the company earned from the sale of its gaming GPUs - a failure the SEC says "deprived investors of critical information [needed] to evaluate the company’s business in a key market".


Announcing the results of its investigation, which specifically relates to Nvidia's actions during its fiscal year 2018, the SEC claimed that while the tech company had reported material growth in revenue within its gaming business at the time, it had failed to reveal to investors that - based on its own information - its gaming sales were driven in significant part by cryptomining.


Why's that important? As the SEC puts it, "These significant earnings and cash flow fluctuations related to a volatile business for investors to ascertain the likelihood that past performance was indicative of future performance."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite having already cancelled one attempt at turning EVE Online into an FPS, developer CCP's enthusiasm for the project apparently remains strong: it's now confirmed that, two years after Project Nova officially got the chop, work on a new FPS continues at its London Studio.


EVE Online FPS Project Nova was initially unveiled in 2016 as a spiritual successor to CCP's long-defunct free-to-play PS3 shooter Dust 514. Almost two years went by with ne'er a peep on the project, but then October 2018 finally brought a more extensive reveal. Unexpectedly, though, just a month later, CCP announced its intention to "return to the drawing board" with Project Nova, and 18 months after that, the game was officially no more.


Despite that rollercoaster ride, CCP said it remained committed to releasing an EVE Online FPS and that work on a new sci-fi shooter, with expanded scope, would continue at its London studio. That was more than two years ago, though, leading many to assume that the project had also run its a course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following comments last week that Final Fantasy 16 was in the "final stages" of development, producer Naoki Yoshida has offered a further progress update, confirming, among other things, that a new trailer for the long-awaited JRPG is expected to release soon.


Previously, Yoshida had told Uniqlo's UT magazine - where he was featured to promote a new Final Fantasy t-shirt line - that Final Fantasy 16 was "in the final stages of development" and that the team hoped to deliver a "comprehensive" experience "full of story and gameplay".


In new comments made during a Nier Reincarnation and Final Fantasy 14 crossover livestream, as translated by Twitch streamer Audrey (thanks Polygon), Yoshida joked to interviewer and Nier producer Yosuke Saito that Square Enix's American PR team "got mad" at him following the Uniqlo comments. Undeterred though, Yoshida was willing to speak a little further on Final Fantasy 16's progress, saying the game is "greatly coming together" but that he wants the development team to spend more time on polishing the experience.

The report comes from developer People Can Fly (via Tweak Tower). Here, the company revealed the game is yet to make its publisher (Square Enix) any revenue. This was something that was suspected in August last year, when the developer said Square Enix was yet to pay it a royalty fee.
But, even in the several months following that initial statement, no royalty fee ended up coming People Can Fly's way in 2021.

In January, Sony announced its plans to buy Destiny maker Bungie for a tidy $3.6bn. And, as has become the norm for deals such as this, the FTC has opened an in-depth investigation into this takeover. 
According to sources (via The Information), this investigation may set the closing date of this deal back by six months, if not more. While we were never given a firm date of when Sony had hoped to have this deal all squared away by on its initial announcement, reports now state that any closure will be happening early next year.

And on a related note, we talk about the latest rumblings of a Ubisoft acquisition - and whether we think the Assassin's Creed creator is the next big games industry acquisition.

"We are working on the most ambitious plan in Call of Duty history, with over 3000 people now working on the franchise and a return to the Modern Warfare setting that delivered our most successful Call of Duty title ever," Activision wrote in its 2021 annual report (via Tweak Town).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The infamous, one-of-a-kind golden Wii meant for the Queen has been put up for auction.


This unique promotional console was crafted by THQ back in 2009 as a stunt to launch a mediocre minigame collection. The publisher famously tried to send the console to the Queen - though it never reached royal hands. 


Now, the console - arguably, a piece of gaming history - has been listed on auction site Goldin. As of the time of writing, the bidding stands at £2k.

Then, in January, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra released a blog post laying out the steps he said will "rebuild trust" in the developer. This included plans to hire new team members, whose roles would focus on improving the company's workplace culture. 
Following the arrival of Activision Blizzard's new chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer Kristen Hines last month, Blizzard has welcomed Jessica Martinez as its "first Vice President, Head of Culture."
Martinez's arrival will mark "part of [Blizzard's] ongoing initiative to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace culture where people at every level can learn, grow and bring their most creative selves to their work," Blizzard says.

The v1.24 release of Kubernetes brings storage capacity
tracking as a generally available feature.
Problems we have solved
As explained in more detail in the previous blog post about this
feature, storage capacity
tracking allows a CSI driver to publish information about remaining
capacity. The kube-scheduler then uses that information to pick suitable nodes
for a Pod when that Pod has volumes that still need to be provisioned.
Without this information, a Pod may get stuck without ever being scheduled onto
a suitable node because kube-scheduler has to choose blindly and always ends up
picking a node for which the volume cannot be provisioned because the
underlying storage system managed by the CSI driver does not have sufficient
capacity left.
Because CSI driv…]]></summary>

TennoCon has, of course, traditionally been a live, in-person event combining Warframe announcements, developer panels, and various community focused activities, but Digital Extremes made the decision to go online-only back in 2020 in reponse to the coronavirus pandemic, meaning this year's TennoCon will be its third fully digital show.


Unfortunately, beyond that 16th July date, Digital Extremes is yet to share much in the ways of details about this year's TennoCon, only saying that the all-day event will feature "exciting reveals" from the team, alongside a community art show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're starting to tire of splicing up the same old animals into DNA hybrid monstrosities in park management sim Let's Build a Zoo, there's some potentially exciting news on the horizon: you'll soon be able to fancy up your adorably terrifying creations into something even more exotic when the game's newly announced Dinosaur Island DLC arrives on 23rd May.


Let's Build a Zoo, if you're unfamiliar, takes the familiar framework of classic zoo tycoons as its starting point, tasking players with importing and breeding animals, managing staff, and fashioning an appealing park using scenery items, shops, and amenities in order to keep guests happy and the money rolling in.


It offers two main twists on that familiar formula, however; there's a morality system - giving players the choice between keeping everything above board or taking a more exploitative path - plus the aforementioned DNA splicing angle, enabling players to create and exhibit the likes of crocoducks, giraffephants, and chickow.

Prey, of course, is yet another winner from Arkane Studios, the developer behind the critically acclaimed likes of Dishonored and Deathloop. As with those series, Prey, which released back in 2017, falls squarely in the immersive sim genre, this time taking the studios' focus on open-ended traversal and player choice into outer space.


Here, players take on the role of Morgan Yu and, after a memorably orchestrated opening sequence, find themselves onboard the space station Talos I somewhere in the year 2032. It's a gorgeously luxuriant setting - Eurogamer called it "perhaps the grandest and most beautiful facility of its kind ever imagined for a game" in its Recommended review - but all is not right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the news that Haden Blackman, studio head and founder of Mafia 3's developer Hangar 13, is stepping down from the role after seven years, a new report has claimed a fourth instalment in the Mafia series is currently in early development at the studio.
That's according to Kotaku, which reports that newly appointed studio boss Nick Baynes is leading development on a brand-new Mafia game, codenamed Nero. The project is said to be a prequel to the Mafia trilogy - which would suggest a return to the prohibition era action of the very first Mafia game, if not even earlier.
Additionally, Hangar 13 will reportedly be ditching its Mafia 3 engine - used in the recent Mafia 1 remake - in favour of Unreal Engine 5. It may, however, be some time before either the studio or publisher 2K Games is ready to talk about the title, given it's still "early in development".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many know already, the Monkey Island series took on a new look as well as a new creative team in its third outing, The Curse of Monkey Island. However, this new art style was not simply because of the change in management behind the game's development. Rather, it was because of the tools being used behind the scenes.
"A new art path had to be developed for Curse of Monkey Island," game designer Jonathan Ackley revealed on Twitter.
"2D games of the time scanned drawings straight to raster, causing heavy aliasing. We used US Animation. It vectorised the line art before compositing and colour/resolution reduction, creating smoother art," he explained.

With the arrival of Halo Infinite's Season 2, Clippy makes a return in the form of a legendary-tier weapon charm, although it's currently unclear how players can unlock it, as it's not available on the Battle Pass or earned in-game. 


Xbox hardware senior project manager James Shields showed off Clippy and the associated nameplate the "Clipster" in a tweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yuke's, the Japanese developer behind two decades of popular WWE games, has announced it is returning to the wrestling genre with new project AEW Fight Forever.


There's no word yet on a release date or platforms (beyond a vague promise of PC and consoles), but today's announcement and first look at development will likely be welcomed by fans who have missed Yuke's work over the past few years. 


Yuke's final WWE game was 2018's WWE 2K19, before publisher 2K Sports gave Yuke's the boot and chose US outfit Visual Concepts to take control of the series instead - with decidedly poor results (so much so that WWE 2K21 was cancelled altogether).

Mark Scicluna, who worked as a senior illustrator and graphic designer on Red Dead Redemption 2, LA Noire Remastered and Bully Anniversary Edition, has created some amazing retro illustrations of other games outside of Rockstar (via GoombaStomp). These include everything from Metal Gear Solid to Crash Bandicoot.
Taking inspiration from the likes of DC comics of old, these illustrations immediately evoke memories of a time since passed, but with a modern twist. My personal favourite is Dino Crisis – just look at the teeth on that triceratops!

The Covid-19 pandemic is the main cause of both the rise and fall of streaming numbers. With more people working from home and spending less time on outdoor leisure activities, streaming viewership increased; now the world is opening up again, those numbers are declining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday we reported that Dying Light's Hellraider DLC was getting its final update. However, despite what was first assumed (by me at least), this is not the end of Techland's plans for its Zombie platformer. Rather, the company has announced a brand new Dieselpunk DLC, which is available from today (5th May).
"Go Back in Time with the New Dieselpunk DLC, discover historical Volkan Machines equipment crafted for world-class soldiers, and enjoy their unique design in Harran," the developer teased. This DLC comes with new gear, most notably a chainsaw known as the 'Gut Render' and a serrated sword known as the 'Flesh Ripper'. With these two weapons in your armoury, you will soon be slicing and dicing your way through those zombie hoards in a breeze.
If you prefer to be less up close and personal with your prey, perhaps the 'Greaser' firearm will be more your thing. In the words of Techland, this gun is the "new definition of swiss cheese". Of course, you could always just barrel through the advancing enemies with your new wheels, aka the 'Rugged Roadster'. Check out the blood-soaked trailer for this new DLC below.

Perry is discussing the relationship between Hitman's Agent 47, voiced by David Bateson, and his handler Diana Burnwood, who she voices. But she could also be talking about the actors themselves.


For both actors, auditioning for these roles was a serendipitous moment. Bateson had recently moved from London to Denmark, while Perry had moved from Canada to London: two actors living away from their native countries.
