        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in February, Activision Blizzard revealed its long-running Warcraft franchise would be heading to mobile some time this year - and we now know exactly what form it'll arrive in thanks to the company's official reveal of free-to-play "tower offence" game Warcraft Arclight Rumble.


Arclight Rumble is being pitched as a combination of strategy game and tower defense, that sees players choosing from one of several leaders across five factions - Alliance, Horde, Beast, Blackrock, and Undead - each with their own abilities and specialisations.


Objectives vary depending on the chosen map (of which Blizzard is promising 70+ at launch), and these can range from skirmishes to boss battles. Players will need to deploy their units from their available "minis" - 60 collectible minis are being touted - and more powerful units can be deployed by gathering gold as a match plays out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has released a new trailer for its upcoming kids shows, giving us a new look at Sonic Prime.
I will cut to the chase, however. Yes, we do have some new footage of the spiked blue one roaring onto the screen as he collects up his golden rings, quipping, "I know what you're thinking - I'm goooood. And powerful, apparently. Jealous?!", but... well that is really all we get to see. On the other hand, it is nice to know that Sonic hasn't been given the boot following Netflix's recent animation purge, so every cloud. 
You can check out the footage for yourself below (PSA: unless you want to see what other kids shows are coming - some of which do certainly look like they are a lot of fun - skip forward to 1.49 to see Sonic's bit).

The test will be limited to the game's Online Seasons and Online Friendlies mode, and let you play together with a friend or against rivals, regardless of their console.


An image shared by EA as part of today's announcement showed a simple button prompt on the game's main menu to opt out of the cross-play test, if you so choose. Cross-play will also become an option in the game's matchmaking settings.

Discussing the long-requested threequel with former Nintendo Treehouse employees Kit and Krysta on their new podcast (thanks, Nintendo Life), producer Shinichi Kameoka was asked directly why Mother 3 had never seen the light of day outside of Japan.


"Personally, I think the biggest selling point of Mother 3 is [creator] Shigesatao Itoi's unique writing style," Kameoka replied, "translating the charm and nuances of his writing into other languages is quite a challenge, and maybe that's why it's taken so long to consider international releases of Mother 3."

"That's part of the reason that we believe the overall semiconductor shortage will now drift into 2024, from our earlier estimates in 2023, just because the shortages have now hit equipment and some of those factory ramps will be more challenged," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Nintendo issued a warning for parents, asking them to ensure that their children always stand far enough away from the TV screen to avoid hitting it, and far enough away from others to avoid any unintentional fisticuffs. 
But alas, even after this warning, and the Wii-era experiences predating this time in our lives, it turns out that many still need to be reminded about the Joy-Cons handy little wrist straps, and why they are actually there. Specifically, when taking part in Nintendo's latest offering: Switch Sports.
Nintendo Switch Sports came out several days ago, and in that time, many have been streaming their own exploits in the fitness themed world it provides. However, while these streams have given many a small taster of the sports that they too could try if they decide to purchase the game, they have also given us a peak into the lives of some Nintendo rebels, who choose to forgo safety warnings.

Dockershim has been removed as of Kubernetes v1.24, and this is a positive move for the project. However, context is important for fully understanding something, be it socially or in software development, and this deserves a more in-depth review. Alongside the dockershim removal in Kubernetes v1.24, we’ve seen some confusion (sometimes at a panic level) and dissatisfaction with this decision in the community, largely due to a lack of context around this removal. The decision to deprecate and eventually remove dockershim from Kubernetes was not made quickly or lightly. Still, it’s been in the works for so long that many of today’s users are newer than that decision, and certainly newer than the choices that led to the dockershim being necessary in the first place.

The sale, which is set to go through by September this year, means Embracer owns Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal and Square Enix Montreal, as well as IPs including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief and Legacy of Kain. That amounts to around 1100 employees.


As already announced, a new Tomb Raider is in development at Crystal Dynamics, built on Unreal Engine 5. Thoughts now turn to other games potentially in development at these just-bought studios.

"It can be started right after Aiden arrives in The City. Since it’s the first one out the gate, we didn’t want to force players to finish the game before they’d be able to have fun with it," Smektała said. "I went through some of the speculations our community has expressed online, but I haven’t seen any of those theories get it right. So I hope that we’ll positively surprise people with this DLC."

YouTuber Jamie Moran was even able to play it on their Xbox Series X and share the footage, stating on Twitter: "The First Forza Horizon game popped up again in the store. Such a fun game, it still holds up really well and it’s 4K on Series X & One X."

https://twitter.com/JamieMoranUK/status/1520557268399501312

The game's sudden and unexpected reappearance six years after it was removed from sale has some fans speculating that it may be making a return. Without official word from the developer or Microsoft, however, we can only chalk this up to a mistake for now.

The latest game in the series, Forza Horizon 5, has seen more than 10 million players since launch. The impressive milestone means Playground's racing game has enjoyed the biggest first week in Xbox and Game Pass history.

Forza Horizon 5 looked like a hit even before it came out, when nearly one million people were already playing via early access on PC and Xbox ahead of the 9th November street date.

The original Forza Horizon game was briefly available to buy from the Xbox store yesterday.

While there's no official word on whether or not the game's return to the Xbox store was intentional, the racer has already been removed again, albeit not quite before some gamers managed to buy and download it (thanks, VGC).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you caught the rumour earlier this week that developers could prevent their games being downloaded on Steam Deck, worry not; turns out it was just an error.
A tweet showed purported evidence that the recently-released Demon Gaze Extra had been specifically configured to prevent downloads to Steam Deck, which understandably worried early adopters of Valve's new handheld system.

Turns out it's just a big misunderstanding, something Valve now suggests was "accidental". It's also promised to "fix the issue" with any other games that similarly prohibit Steam Deck installations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players rushing to get into Call of Duty Warzone Season 3 have seemingly contributed to Virgin Media O2's "biggest gaming traffic spike on record".

Call of Duty Warzone Season 3 released at 5pm on Wednesday 27th April - albeit a day earlier for Vanguard players - and the rush of players downloading and jumping into the new season has purportedly resulted in internet provider Virgin Media's busiest day of the year thus far - and its second-busiest since records began.

According to our sister site VGC, the average Virgin Media customer downloaded 12.1GB of data between 4pm and midnight on 27th April - that's up 29 per cent on the preceding week - whilst the busiest period of 8-10pm saw an uptick in data consumption, 11.9 per cent higher than usual and 23.8 per cent higher than the week before.

Whilst not formally confirmed by Microsoft nor Electronic Arts - so treat this as a rumour for now - both games now sport the Game Pass logo (thanks, XGP, via NME) on the former's online store, suggesting they may get their debut on Microsoft's subscription service next month. 

As FIFA 22 was released in October 2021 and Battlefield 2042 in November, this means both games will only be around six months old should they indeed be joining Microsoft's library of games soon.

That's according to a new developer diary in which Hinterland Studio reflects on the last eight years of development, as well as teasing what may be coming next, including a premium season pass to ensure the game "continues to be financially self-sustaining".

After focussing for so long on the sandbox and story modes, the team says it's now ready to "decouple" them, mitigating issues that founder Raphael van Lierop says made development "unwieldy" at times.

"Due to project progress, the Version 2.7 update will be postponed," the developer tweeted. "For detailed information on the date of the new update, content adjustment plan, and compensation, please stay tuned for upcoming announcements."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known developer Sloclap's challenging kung-fu beat-'em-up Sifu would be getting much-requested difficulty settings for some time, but now, following the release of a new content roadmap earlier this week, Sloclap has offered a closer look at how they'll function when they arrive in a new update next Tuesday, 3rd May.


As we learned earlier this week, Sifu's new difficulty levels will come in three flavours - Student, Disciple, and Master - and Sloclap's latest preview trailer breaks each setting down in a little more detail. Disciple, for instance, will offer the "classic Sifu experience", and it's the option for those that want to continue playing the game as it is now.
Student, however, is designed for those wanting a slightly easier ride. It'll make the experience "more forgiving but still challenging", by increasing player health, making ageing more forgiving, and introducing weaker enemies with less aggressive AI that use simplified combos.

<p>At around 10 a.m., a nearby resident spotted the squid at Ugu beach in Obama, Fukui Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast. According to the Obama Municipal Government, the squid was still alive when it was found. It is unusual for a giant squid to be washed ashore alive, officials said.</p>
<p>The deep-sea creature will be transported to Echizen Matsushima Aquarium in the prefectural city of Sakai.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, I do not expect the giant squid to survive, certainly not long enough for me to fly there and see it. But if any Japanese readers can supply more information, I would very much appreciate it...</p>]]></summary>

Yoku’s Island Express, which will be available to download from 1st-31st May is a strange but successful blend of platforming and pinball that Eurogamer's Christian Donlan liked a lot when it released back in 2018, calling it a "wild-spirited adventure to cherish."


Next up, and available to download from 16th May to 15th June, is The Inner World: The Last Wind Monk. This one, developed by Studio Fizbin (responsible for last year's striking Minute of Islands), is a follow-up to acclaimed 2013 point-and-click adventure The Inner World, and once again follows young, flute-nosed adventurer Robert on a quest to save the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom's been taking the slow and steady approach to revealing more on Monster Hunter Rise's Sunbreak expansion since its initial unveiling last year, but now, with its 30th June release approaching, the news is coming faster, and the publisher is promising "exciting reveals" and more for its next digital event on Tuesday, 10th May.


Precisely what will feature remains a mystery, but, alongside those aforementioned "exciting reveals", Capcom is also promising new gameplay, a look at some new monsters, and other currently unspecified treats. If your interest is suitably piqued, proceedings kick off at 3pm in the UK/7am PDT on 10th May via Twitch, and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak’s director, Yoshitake Suzuki, will be on presenting duties.


Capcom’s previous Sunbreak digital event was a biggie, giving us a release date, a look at some new monsters, as well as an introduction to the expansion’s new hub area - the bustling port town of Elgado Outpost - and its new map, The Citadel. The latter promises to deliver a diverse range of biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece - and we got an extended tour in a subsequent video.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In the post-pandemic era, video conferencing apps (VCAs) have converted previously private spaces &#8212; bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens &#8212; into semi-public extensions of the office. And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

This week, PlayStation Plus subscribers found they were unable to redeem pre-paid voucher cards and extend their subscription time - even if it was about to run out. Bewildered customers were told the situation was "temporary", but not given further explanation.


Now, Sony has updated its FAQ page for its upcoming PlayStation Plus changes and ackwnowledged the move - and said that, for now, you'll only be able to redeem pre-paid vouchers you have bought after your current Plus membership expires.

In a tweet from PlayStation, that also comes with a colourful teaser, the company revealed that Stray will be coming to consoles this summer. Previously we had been given an "early 2022" window but, given that we are now into Q2 and not been told a more concrete date, this new timeframe isn't exactly a surprise. 
Along with Stray, We are OFK will also be releasing this summer. Meanwhile Cult of the Lamb, which was previously only slated for a release "later this year" will be coming our way this autumn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After employees from Blizzard Versailles were made redundant in 2020, a move that preceded the studio's closure, those affected began a legal battle with the company. Now, staff that were made redundant have won their appeal.
As reported by French outlet Gamekult (via Gamesindustry.biz), an appeal court has invalidated the redundancies that led to the closure of the branch in 2020. As such, those looking to seek further legal actions will now potentially be entitled to "further compensations, equivalent to a minimum of six months of salary".
But while this is certainly still a victory in itself, it does not mean former Blizzard Versailles employees will find their positions reinstated in a different studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has suffered a setback in its bid to punish a group of cheaters who sold "hacks" for Destiny 2. 


A court has dimissed much of Bungie's legal action against cheat site AimJunkies, in which it had alleged copyright and trademark infringement, as well as breach of contract, "tortious interference" and "unjust enrichment" (thanks, TorrentFreak).


AimJunkies had argued back and said its cheating software was its own work, not a copy of Bungie's code. The Destiny developer's other claims, it continued, should also be kept out of court per clauses in Bungie's own user license agreement. Now, a US judge has largely agreed.

They offer an escape from the mundane rigger of everyday life and give us the chance to experience whole new worlds of fantasy and adventure. However, while Marvel's Guardians of the galaxy certainly does this in spades with its eclectic cast and bustling locales, there is one area that is (for me at least) just like home. 
Yes, I am talking about that damn fridge on the Milano that just will not stay shut. No matter how many times you get Star-Lord to close the door, it will always reopen again (and again and again and again).
But it turns out I am not alone in my quest to get that door closed (we need to save energy here people). In fact, that little seemingly benign door has been closed a grand total of 18.6m times. Much like the Guardians of Galaxy devs do as well, I admire the tenacity.

Infinfity Ward revealed the name last night via Twitter, alongside the game's logo. To me it looks more like MIIW rather than MWII. Others, meanwhile, have said it reminds them of Nine Inch Nails.

One of the highlights of hosting the weekly Kubernetes Podcast from Google is talking to the release managers for each new Kubernetes version. The release team is constantly refreshing. Many working their way from small documentation fixes, step up to shadow roles, and then eventually lead a release.
As we prepare for the 1.24 release next week, in accordance with long-standing tradition, I'm pleased to bring you a look back at the story of 1.23. The release was led by Rey Lejano, a Field Engineer at SUSE. I spoke to Rey in December, as he was awaiting the birth of his first child.

That's according to VentureBeat reporter Jeff Grubb in his latest Grubbsnax episode (as transcribed by VGC), who claims publisher EA and Respawn had initially been aiming to launch the Fallen Order sequel later this year, but that those plans have since changed and the game "is for sure now not coming out until 2023".


This later-than-planned release date combined with the decision to drop support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in favour of the newer consoles and PC means, according to Grubb, the development team won't "have to worry about trying to straddle these generation lines".

There's still some way to go until the deal is finalise, however; while Activision Blizzard stockholders - and, earlier in the week, board members - have now given the deal the go-ahead, it's still subject to regulatory review around the world, by the likes of the Federal Trade Commission in the US, to determine if the deal constitutes unfair competition.


Should the deal make it through regulatory review, the acquisition has until June 2023 to close, whereupon Microsoft will welcome some of the industries most recognisable franchises into its fold, including Call of Duty, Warcraft, Overwatch, and mobile hit Candy Crush.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's revamped PlayStation Plus isn't too far away now, with the company currently targeting a 22nd June launch in Europe, but questions around the service still remain, particularly concerning the library of games that'll be made to available to higher-tier subscribers. But while Sony's lips remain officially sealed, it appears the first batch of retro games coming to the top-end Premium tier have begun leaking onto PSN.


PlayStation Plus' new Premium tier gives subscribers access to around 340 additional games beyond the library of 400 PS4 and PS5 titles included in the mid-range Extra tier, focusing on retro games from PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3, and PSP. Sony is yet to offer specifics on either library, but users on Reddit have spotted that new listings for classic titles, complete with new thumbnail art, are starting to appear in the PSN backend, pointing to the beginnings of a roll-out for PlayStation Plus' retro games.


Granted, there are only three such titles to be found at present, all from publisher Bandai Namco - Tekken 2 and Mr. Driller for PlayStation 1, and Ridge Racer for PSP - but it does suggests the floodgates are slowly starting to open as publishers move to get their classic titles in order ready for the new PlayStation Plus launch.

It has also begun a pledge, encouraging those in the industry, as well as those who are against the use of NFTs in general, to sign and make positive moves towards a "sustainable, socially responsible, equitable future for all".
Given the rise in blockchain technology, and the growing number of companies looking to implement it in their games, Climate Replay has additionally released a guide addressing everything that is wrong with NFTs.
"NFTs are the digital elephant in the room for the games industry right now, and many are feeling the pressure to pick a side," Climate Replay wrote (via TheGamer). "... This technology has massive implications for games, the climate crisis, and society at large. Our hope is that, by the end of this guide, readers will have a broad foundation of knowledge on top of which they can make truly informed decisions regarding NFTs."

In-office working - "embedded" within a developer - is one of the services which Keywords offers, and over the years the company has worked with BioWare and others to offer development support in this way.

Several who have raised the matter with PlayStation customer support say they  have been told Sony has "temporarily" disabled the ability to stack Plus subscription time ahead of the new PS Plus changes due in June. 


Just yesterday, we covered how existing PlayStation Now owners with an active PS Plus subscription (who will get upgraded to the priciest PS Plus Premium tier) were trying to extend their PS Plus for as long as possible. Per PlayStation's own FAQ page, the company will take the longest-running active subscription when setting the converted membership's end date, essentially allowing Now members to stock up on regular Plus cards to receive the same time as a Premium subscriber.

The end results - Xbox's very own tartan, which is now on a controller (although I also spotted a rather dashing pair of trews, as well). 
"The pattern, using the brand's iconic colours, has been endorsed by the Scottish Tartans Authority and entered into The Scottish Register of Tartans," Xbox shared yesterday. "The landmark pattern and limited-edition controllers commemorate the history of Xbox with a contemporary design created by Edinburgh-based tartan designer Gordon Nicolson, makers of the Scotland National Football Team Tartan."
Check out a video showing the making of Xbox's new tartan below, as well as a closer look at a very smartly dressed controller (which appears to be a true Scotsman, as no underwear lies between the controller and its tartan cladding - cheeky).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reggie Fils-Aimé says he's a believer in blockchain and so-called play-to-own technology. 


Speaking at last month's SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, Fils-Aimé was asked what role blockchain, crypto and play-to-earn technology had in the future of gaming (thanks, Nintendo Life). 


He appeared to be quite enthusiastic about the idea: "So I'm a believer in blockchain, I think it's a really compelling technology. I'm also a believer in the concept of 'play to own' within video games, and I say this as a player where I may have invested 50 hours, 100 hours, or 300 hours in a game, and when I'm ready to move on to something else, wouldn't it be great to monetise what I've built?"

Reddit user Mar_Reddit shared a video of the holy encounter (thanks Kotaku), where he invaded another player's game only to discover dedicated role-players posing as Jesus and Satan awaiting him in the Rapture pose.


While he thought it was a trap, he moves closer to discover their true identities and share an Erdtree heal incantation like a prayer.

The advice, posted by Nintendo's Japanese customer support Twitter account (thanks, Nintendo Life), warns that children should take care not to accidentally hit each other while playing. 


Anyone playing the game should stand a good distance from their TV, the advice continued, so you do not hit the Joy-Con controller on the screen.

The Ingress may be one of the most targeted components
of Kubernetes. An Ingress typically defines an HTTP reverse proxy, exposed to the Internet, containing
multiple websites, and with some privileged access to Kubernetes API (such as to read Secrets relating to
TLS certificates and their private keys).
While it is a risky component in your architecture, it is still the most popular way to properly expose your services.
Ingress-NGINX has been part of security assessments that figured out we have a big problem: we don't
do all proper sanitization before turning the configuration into an nginx.conf file, which may lead to information

Parkasaurus, for those yet to experience the game's vibrant, dino-infused spin on the classic theme park management formula, challenges players to build and run their very own dinosaur-flavoured tourist attraction - a task requiring them to hurtle back to the past to unearth new dinosaurs then build the perfect habitats to keep them happy, ensuring their specific terrain, water, food, privacy, and scenery needs are met.


And on top of all that, there are the usual park management demands to content with, ranging from landscaping and staff wrangling to ensuring all guests' needs - be they food, entertainment, merchandise, or bowel related - are adequately catered for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks to the success of Stardew Valley and its ilk, you can barely move for video games insistently attempting to thrust you into some idyllic digital corner for a bout of wholesome pal-making or enthusiastic vegetable palpating these days, and now it's Disney's turn to get in on the action with its newly announced free-to-play village life sim Dreamlight Valley.


The set-up for Dreamlight Valley goes that, once upon a time, a bunch of Disney and Pixar characters all lived happily together in the idyllic land of the title - until, that is, a cataclysmic event known as the Forgetting stole everyone's memories. It's up to players, then, to explore and restore the kingdom (and its inhabitants' memories too), in an adventure that combines life-sim-style action with more traditional questing.


As Dreamlight Valley unfolds, players will be able to travel to exotic biomes beyond the village and befriend classic Disney and Pixar characters - each with their own story arcs, quests, and rewards - including the likes of Elsa and Anna in a snowy, Frozen-inspired kingdom, Ariel in a tropical corner of the world, and even the Lion King crew across a sunny savanna.

<p>Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>2021 included the detection and disclosure of 58 in-the-wild 0-days, the most ever recorded since Project Zero began tracking in mid-2014. That’s more than double the previous maximum of 28 detected in 2015 and especially stark when you consider that there were only 25 detected in 2020. We’ve tracked publicly known in-the-wild 0-day exploits in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a> since mid-2014.</p>
<p>While we often talk about the number of 0-day exploits used in-the-wild, what we’re actually discussing is the number of 0-day exploits detected and disclosed as in-the-wild. And that leads into our first conclusion: we believe the large uptick in in-the-wild 0-days in 2021 is due to increased detection and disclosure of these 0-days, rather than simply increased usage of 0-day exploits...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its ongoing war against cheaters, the team behind Call of Duty's server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution has announced it's implemented a new mitigation technique, known as Cloaking, that will prevent cheaters from seeing opponents during a match.


As explained in new blog post highlighting the latest developments for Call of Duty's Ricochet anti-cheat solution, Cloaking follows a similar philosophy to its previous Damage Shield initiative in that it's designed to "give legitimate players a leg up on cheaters."


While Damage Shield effectively turned on God Mode for all legitimate players when a cheater was detected in a match, Cloaking aims its focus squarely at the cheater, making it impossible for them to see opponents, bullets, and even sounds. "Legitimate players, however," the post explains, "can see cheaters impacted by cloaking (generally, they’ll be the players you see spinning in circles hollering, 'Who is shooting me?!') and can dole out in-game punishment."

This means anyone still with an active Now subscription who has also stacked a PS Plus sub for months (or even years) to come will get converted to Premium for as long as their existing Plus sub is set last.


The difficulty in taking advantage of this now is that Sony has stopped selling Now subscriptions - presumably to deter people who were previously not Now subscribers but who are after a bargain.

At present the revenue split for partners is 50/50 for a tier one subscription, 60/40 at tier two, and 70/30 at tier three, in favour of the streamer. Some top Twitch partners have privately negotiated an alternative revenue split.


However, according to a new report from Bloomberg, this revenue split may be pared down to a 50 percent cut across the board.

These enemies have humanoid facial features and will attack when approached. However, these mysterious creatures are often heard before they are seen, as (as their name suggests) they sing a rather haunting song known as the Song of Lament.
This song is sung in Latin, adding to the mysterious aura that surrounds these bats. However, one player has recently discovered a translation of the bats' song and revealed its unsettling translation.
Twitter user Chinchillazilla (via Screen Rant) wrote, "just learned that the singing bats in Elden Ring are singing in Latin and their song is a huge bummer". The user then went on leave a copy of the translated song for others to mull over.

Indeed, the language of today's call from British Gas has been criticised for passing the blame for high bills onto consumers. There have also been questions asked about the numbers British Gas has used to calculate its savings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Soulsborne dataminer Lance McDonald offered Elden Ring fans a peek behind the Lands Between's ordinarily sealed colosseum doors, and now, a fresh delve inside has revealed more of what may have been planned for the currently dormant structures during development.


Elden Ring players will no doubt be familiar with the gargantuan colosseums that lie at three points on the map - one just beyond Stormveil Bridge, another jutting out from Caelid's coastline, and a third set high above Leyndell, Royal Capital. They're imposing things on the outside, and McDonald's initial boundary break video revealed, somewhat surprisingly given their impenetrable nature, that developer FromSoftware hadn't skimped on their innards either.


By following a series of intricate passageways beyond one of the colosseum's closed doors, McDonald emerged in a vast arena overlooked by a lavishly rendered viewing area. And while the discovery lead some to theorise the arenas could be intended for PvP play at some future point, a fresh delve has suggested there maybe a little more going on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2K Games is reportedly looking to take on developer Psyonix's mighty Rocket League, and is currently developing its own spin on the four-wheeled football formula, titled Gravity Goal, that'll supposedly switch out the cars in favour of TRON-like bikes.


That's according to reliably leaky journalist Tom Henderson who, writing for Exputer, claims Gravity Goal will be "just like Rocket League" in as far as it'll offer up 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 matches where the aim is for players to knock a ball into a goal using their vehicles.


Henderson reports a number of twists on the Rocket League formula, however; alongside the switch from cars to TRON-like bikes - an aesthetic that'll reportedly be reflected in Gravity Goal's arenas, sporting a "futuristic and high-energy-based vibe" - players will be able to damage their opponents' bikes by hitting them with a hockey-puck-like disc. This'll supposedly also either slow down or stop any vehicles it hits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Netflix's initial dalliances with video games toward the end of last year, which saw the streaming service begin offering a small selection of casual mobile games to subscribers, the streaming service is reportedly looking to significantly ramp up its offerings before the end of 2022, expanding its gaming library to almost 50 titles.


When Netflix launched its fledging video game service last November, subscribers were able to choose between a total of five games as part  of their normal subscription. That number has steadily grown since then, with Netflix currently offering 18 games to subscribers - but a new report by the Washington Post says the company is going big in 2022, aiming to offer nearly 30 more titles by the end of the year.


There's currently no indication of what these titles may be - other than that Netflix will reportedly be sticking with mobile games "for now" - but we do know the streaming service has been attempting to expand its video game development know-how since last year, in the form of three studio acquisitions. It now owns Texas-based mobile developer Boss Fight Entertainment, Next Games - which made Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales - and, as of last September, Oxenfree developer Night School Studio.

Currently, standalone copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, 3, and CD can be purchased for between £3-4 a piece on Steam and the Xbox Store, putting their combined value significantly below the £32.99/$39.99 asking price of Sonic Origins' standard edition.


As of those games' delisting on 20th May, however, the only way to purchase Sonic's early titles digitally will be via Sonic Origins, with the one exception: the Sega Ages versions of Sonic 1 and 2 on Switch will remain on sale. Sega also notes Sonic the Hedgehog 2 will remain playable as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + subscription.

According to a GameDeveloper report, PlayStation has updated its developer guidelines to state that a game demo lasting at least two hours will now be required for any title which costs $34 or higher (around £27). 


This rule is not retroactive, so will only apply to games currently in development and not yet released. Additionally, developers will have a three-month grace period after a game launches before this trial must be made available.

In this video, entitled "The Sound of Adventure", audio director Mark Lampert and Starfield composer Inon Zur chat more about what music means to them, and why it is important for the overall gameplay experience.
"I always say, music is the fourth dimension. It is the emotional dimension," Zur explains. "In order to create this, you have to ask these questions - where are you going? What is your motivation? What is your story? What is really pushing us?" It is these questions, that Zur says are "as big as space", that drove the compressor forward with his work on the game.

And yet, despite all this, was still somehow colourful and cute looking? Well, wonder no more, as Call of the Sea developer Out of the Blue has today announced its latest game - American Arcadia - and it looks like that is just what it's going to be. 
You can check out the new teaser for yourself below.
American Arcadia tasks players with escaping a seemingly idyllic life of luxury. However - plot twist (which admittedly I may have spoiled with my opening sentence) - this life is not all it is cracked up to be. Rather, residents in this apparent utopia are under the watchful gaze of "countless anonymous observers". Shudders.

Naughty Dog QA Corey Hong has both "QA testing and development support on environment design for unannounced multiplayer project" and "QA testing and development support + Level Point of Contact for unannounced remake project" listed on their resumé. This, fans expect, relates to both The Last of Us' long-awaited standalone multiplayer component and a remake of the initial game. 
While Naughty Dog has never officially announced it is remaking The Last of Us, its existence was first reported over a year ago now. Bloomberg initially revealed the project, claiming that it was in development at an unannounced new studio created within its little-known San Diego-based Visual Arts Service Group, but was handed to Naughty Dog after Sony had a change of mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Combined sales of the Xbox Series X and S consoles gave Microsoft its biggest March in terms of hardware revenue for a decade. 


Xbox Series X/S led the US console market in March - and cumulatively over the year's first quarter - in terms of dollar sales, according to numbers from analytics firm NPD. 


However, Nintendo Switch still was the US' best-selling console in terms of units sold, in March and across 2022 to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has ended the online services for 90 of its games. Don't be too alarmed though, as they are all from a considerably older catalogue of titles. We are talking about games such as Scrabble 2007 and Far Cry on PC.
Other games affected by this announcement include Splinter Cell: Double Agent for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Tom Clancy's EndWar (also for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) and Watch Dogs Companion for Andriod and iOS, with the full list available here.
However, do not worry if you still enjoy a twirl around the dancefloor with the likes of the Xbox 360's Just Dance 3, as the offline features for each game will still remain available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go developer Niantic has now officially announced its overhaul of the Mega Evolution mechanic, which was previously leaked through datamined game files. 


As expected, the changes go a long way to answering fan criticism of the way Pokémon Go has handled Mega Evolution since it was introduced in August 2020 - in particular, adding the ability to re-Mega Evolve a creature without energy cost after it has been Mega Evolved once.


Players in Australia and New Zealand can access the new system now, with a global rollout expected shortly. (The game's next Mega Pokémon release is due this Friday, so we'd expect before then.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Workers at Call of Duty developer Raven Software are now one step closer to realising their unionisation efforts, something which, it's fair to say, has not been encouraged by parent company Activision Blizzard.
Axios has reported that those at Raven Software have now obtained approval from the National Labour Relations Board to move forward with a vote on whether to unionise. This is a major step for the QA team, as previous efforts for voluntary recognition from ABK had been denied. This latest approval means that legally, should the vote to unionise be won by the majority of workers, Activision Blizzard will have to recognise its workers' terms and conditions.
"Once a union has been certified or recognised, the employer is required to bargain over your terms and conditions of employment with your union representative," states the NLRB.

VRR dynamically syncs the refresh rate of HDMI 2.1 VRR-compatible TVs and PC monitors to the PlayStation 5's graphical output, helping, as Sony puts it in its announcement post, to minimise or eliminate visual artifacts, including frame pacing issues and screen tearing.


"Gameplay in many PS5 titles feels smoother as scenes render seamlessly, graphics look crisper, and input lag is reduced," it adds.

Following on from last year's similarly styled event, Capcom is poised to hold another Ace Attorney orchestra concert on 7th May at the Bunkamura Orchard Hall in Shibuya, Tokyo, this time in honour of the series' 20th anniversary.
If your interest is piqued, the official website has now revealed the full, series-spanning set list for the 20th anniversary concert (which you'll find below) and you can get a solid idea of what's in store by watching this 7-minute snippet from the 2021 show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend marked the tenth anniversary of Telltale Games' celebrated The Walking Dead series, and to mark the occasion, publisher Skybound Games has released a new mini-documentary bringing with it various behind-the-scenes treats, including early prototype footage, and even the revelation that Telltales' genre-defining adventure was at one point planned to be a Left 4 Dead spin-off.


Telltale Games' The Walking Dead first released on 24th April 2012, and, over the course of Season 1's five critically acclaimed episodes, would establish not only the template for pretty much every one of the studio's releases from that point onward - blending real-time events and persistent choices - but a host of other narrative-driven adventures too, most notably the work of Life is Strange developer Dontnod.


However, as revealed by The Walking Dead's season design and direction lead Jake Rodkin in the newly released mini-documentary, Telltale could have ended up with a very different zombie experience if it's original plans had come to pass, given the project started life as a pitch to do a narrative side-story within Valve's Left 4 Dead universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right on cue, with Apex Legends' current season rapidly racing towards its conclusion, developer Respawn Entertainment has started cranking the hype handle for the free-to-play battle royale shooter's imminent thirteenth instalment - confirming that Newcastle will play a major role when it launches on 10th May.
Newcastle, who'll be Season 13's latest playable hero (sorry to disappoint if you had other ideas), is described as the Hero of Harris Valley, but, more importantly in lore terms, has a direct connection to another Apex Legends character - with Respawn confirming Newcastle to be none other than Jackson Williams, the long-missing brother of Bangalore.
Newcastle's arrival in Apex Legends isn't too much of a surprise, of course; back in March, a huge Apex Legends leak seemingly revealed, accurately it now appears, the game's next nine seasons' worth of unannounced heroes - with Newcastle being the most likely candidate for Season 13 at the time, given his advanced stages of development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a controversial launch and a series of updates focussed on course correction, Gran Turismo 7 got its first proper content drop today, bringing three new cars and a sort of new track into the mix, as well as a suite of fixes and new features. 


Let's get the disappointing bit out the way first - the new track on offer is the 24-hour layout of the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium, which makes bold and daring changes to the layout you'll likely know well by…. Changing the position of the start/finish straight. So it's the same track you know and love, with Eau Rouge serving as the first corner rather than La Source, but this new configuration inspired by the round-the-clock race does at least suggest extended support of Gran Turismo 7's time-of-day feature. 


In terms of new cars, leading the charge is the Subaru BRZ GT300 which was seen challenging and indeed conquering last year's Super GT series, and it's joined by its road legal offspring the freshly tweaked Subaru BRZ S. For lovers of kei cars there's a neat surprise in the diminutive form of the Suzuki Cappucino EA11R from 1991 (you'll find it on sale in the used car dealership).

Around 10 minutes of footage from one user reveals Peridot's opening tutorial, item shop and a list of possible tasks to increase your creature's happiness. These tasks include pointing your phone camera (and therefore your Peridot pet) at specific objects like a flower, a cat or a dog.

The Stalker 2 website, unsurprisingly, includes a message of support for Ukraine. The developer has also called for an end to Russia's brutal invasion of its home country, as it struggles to continue development while Kyiv has been under attack.


Now, the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation has blocked access to the website for Russian audiences, removing access to anyone in the country without use of a proxy. The RIA Novosti news agency said the move followed GSC's decision to cease business in Russia (thanks, XGP.pl, via VGC).

Co-operative gameplay has been a staple of FromSoftware's games since Demon's Souls, allowing players to summon in help. However, if either player dies they must restart again; and if a boss is defeated, the summoned player will still be booted.


YouTuber LukeYui is now working on a mod that will stop players from being booted out during multiplayer (spotted by TheGamer).

Confirmation came by way of the official Borderlands Twitter page, which finally gave us a window - if not yet an exact date - as to when PlayStation players will be able to hook up with their pals on other platforms: spring 2022.

In a blog post justifying the changes (thanks, PCGN), CCP says the uplift "reflects global trends impacting general productions costs and accounts for years of inflation" and have been introduced in order to "continue investing in Eve Online’s evolution and growth".

"Since Eve Online’s original launch back in 2003, together EVE’s developers and community have led the charge in evolving what sandbox MMOs can be," the post explains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An update to Call of Duty developer Infinity Ward's Twitter page has fans speculating that the team may be ready to announced a new Modern Warfare game.

On Friday, Infinity Ward switched out both its Twitter banner and profile icon which - at first blush, anyway - seemed to be solid black logos with no image or text. 

Brightened up, however, and eagle-eyed players think they've spotted fan-favourite character Ghost lurking in the background, sparking whispers that an announcement is imminent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following GOG's example, CD Projekt is reportedly considering introducing paid menstrual leave for its employees.
In recognition of the impact period pain has on some staff, at the time of the announcement GOG said the "experimental" leave "breaks taboos" and is "yet another step towards making GOG an even more inclusive workplace", but it won’t stop its "continuous efforts to learn, reflect and improve on how we can do better for all of our team members".

Given the initiative was announced at the start of April not everyone was convinced of the sincerity of the announcement, but Axios confirms the scheme was introduced following the personal experiences from inside GOG's own team.

"Straight from the highly acclaimed horror game Silent Hill 2 comes a high-quality statue of the iconic Bubble Head Nurse, a sinister female monster manifested from James Sunderland’s subconscious," the blurb explains.

The co-op campaign was expected to release next month after it was delayed from the initial launch. However, last month developer 343 Industries acknowledged that it needed "more time" to work on the cooperative campaign and Forge, and cooperative missions would not be available in May as hoped.

Now, in an image on the company's latest news update, 343i has revealed the "target" for campaign co-op is August, along with campaign mission replay. The Forge Open Beta is slated for September, but split-screen isn't expected until sometime during November's Season 3.

"There are no good guys, no bad guys, with only nature as the adversary," a press statement teases. "A sandstorm will appear randomly in wild areas of battle royale. Players entering the sandstorm will be challenged to avoid hurricanes and tornadoes to reach the high-tier loot and special items contained within the weather event."

Dropping on 28th April at 1am UK time, season 4 also offers two new maps - Cold War's Satellite and Modern Warfare 2019's Khandor Hideout - as well as new operators, weapons, blueprints, calling cards, charms, and COD Points, plus 50 new tiers of "Battle Pass rewards".

<p>&#8220;The metal islands in our composite material are next to one another when the material is relaxed and become separated when the material is stretched, allowing for control of the reflection and transmission of infrared light or heat dissipation,&#8221; said Gorodetsky. &#8220;The mechanism is analogous to chromatophore expansion and contraction in a squid&#8217;s skin, which alters the reflection and transmission of visible light.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

As reported by Promobricks (via VGC), an official Lego version of the Atari 2600 console - which initially released as the Atari VCS all the way back in 1977 - complete with distinctive wooden trim, will arrive this August as part of Atari's 50th anniversary celebrations.


Promobricks says the set - not to to be confused with the fan-made submission on Lego's Ideas website - will include a Lego rendition of the console itself (said to be roughly the size of the 1977 original), a replica of the equally iconic CX40 joystick, plus a cartridge of gaming classic Pitfall! fashioned from plastic bricks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch's Joy-Con controllers have become notorious for their struggles with "drift", to the point that lawsuits have been launched over the issue, the EU has pledged to investigate, and Nintendo's president has even formally apologised. A new report, though, shines additional light on the extent of the issue, claiming that Nintendo's US arm was receiving "easily thousands" of faulty controllers a week for repair at the height of the problem.


That's according to a new report by Kotaku, which, citing a former supervisor at the Switch repair facility (run by United Radio under contract with Nintendo), claims the volume of repairs got so high - with "hundreds" of faulty controllers arriving each day - that work became "very stressful", leading to high turnover in the department and "lots of" repair mistakes.


Nintendo's initial response to the Joy-Con drift problem, reportedly saw the company providing replacements for customers' faulty Joy-Cons between 2017 and 2018; however, that policy is said to have eventually changed and repair staff were then required to repair every set of Joy-Cons received. At the height of Switch's Joy-Con drift issues, Nintendo's repair centre was reportedly receiving “easily thousands" of faulty units each week, necessitating the establishment of new workplace specifically for controller repairs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2 might have had a rocky road to release, but it looks like the project has paid off for developer Techland; the studio has revealed its zombie parkour sequel has surpassed 5m copies sold across all platforms since its launch at the start of February, with that number reflective of sales as of 28th February and said to be "significantly growing" each month.


By way of comparison, we can look toward Dying Light's original instalment, also regarded as a sizeable hit for the studio. That game - according to new figures released by Techland today - has now sold 20m copies since launching a little over seven years ago in 2015, meaning its follow-up really is off to a flying start.


All that suggests a healthy future for Dying Light 2 - doubtlessly reassuring for Techland, given the developer has already committed to five years of post-launch DLC support for the game. Already that promise has brought the likes of new armour, weapons, events, and challenges to the game, with the first bit of substantial post-launch story content scheduled to arrive this June.

A new trailer today has showcased its 4v4 online Turf War battle mode across "a mix of new and familiar stages". Fresh off the boat here is Eeltail Alley, a new level, and the stringer, a bow-shaped weapon type you can fire ink from both vertically and horizontally.


In single-player mode, meanwhile, you'll fight the Octarians and "discover the secrets of Alterna and the Fuzzy Ooze". I have no doubt Splatoon master and Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson is excited by the sounds of that.

A bonus listed simply as "Letterbox Background" is highlighted as being available in either the Premium Fun Pack DLC or the separate Start Dash Pack DLC - free but only if you pre-order.

In a new ruling, reported by Axios, a judge has now decided much of Majo's case lacked necessary evidence.

As transcribed by VGC, Grubb began by saying early word on the game appeared to be positive, with those who've played it being "very impressed with the way it feels."


According to Grubb, EA's goal with Skate 4 is to modernise the series while retaining its much-loved skating core, with some of the new features said to be akin to those seen in the likes of Forza or other modern multiplayer games. These reportedly includes ample customisation options for characters - "a lot of skins, skins for your board, things like that", Grubb explained - as well as user-generated content, which Skate 4 will "really emphasise".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sci-fi grand strategy game Stellaris' new Overlord expansion has been given a release date and will be making its way to PC on 12th May, arriving alongside a free update for all players.


Overlord is Stellaris' sixth major expansion (following on from Nemesis, Federations, MegaCorp, Apocalypse, and Utopia), and brings a range of new options for players as they spread their influence among the stars, this time loosely focussed on empire management.


There are, for instance, new vassalisation mechanics, enabling players to negotiate or demand the terms of their agreements with their new vassals, or even define the specialist role they'll play in an empire - either focusing on military might, tech research, or economic acquisition.

Developed by Forever Entertainment and MegaPixel Studio, which previously collaborated on the similar Panzer Dragoon remake, this updated version of Sega's beloved 1997 arcade rail-shooter, delivers all the ludicrous zombie blasting action (and wonderfully awful dialogue) of the original, albeit with a fresh lick of modern-day paint.


Alongside its enhanced visuals, which you can scrutinise for yourself in the trailer below, House of the Dead: Remake also features a new Horde mode that increases the on-screen enemy count, updated controls (what with modern hardware largely being upsettingly lightgun-free), two-player local co-op, a photo mode, gallery, leaderboards, and achievements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're talking about Microsoft and Sony's plans to put advertising in free-to-play games. It's a feature commonly found - and widely accepted, if not enjoyed - in free mobile titles, which now seems to be on the way to your PlayStation and Xbox.
It's fair to say that few people enjoy advertising and it's unlikely you'd opt into seeing more of it - but do Microsoft and Sony see this as a way to encourage new, smaller developers into the console space? Of course, a lot depends on how these plans are implemented - and here we chew over a few ways that could be worse than others.
Finally, to lighten the mood, we have a chat about Amy Hennig's return to the Star Wars universe and the sheer number of upcoming games set in the galaxy far, far away we now have to look forward to. Apex Legends developer is making three, alongside projects from Quantic Dream, Ubisoft and others. Joining me to discuss all that are Eurogamer reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan!

To put it into context, Dre hadn't published any new music since his last album, Compton, back in 2015. 


So just how did Rockstar convince one of the greatest rappers in history to play such a large role in a video game?

F1 22, as it's monikered, will of course feature all the tracks and new cars of the new season, alongside tweaked physics to take into account the ground-effect enabled cornering speeds of the new breed. It'll also offer the debut of the new Miami circuit, as well as a refined race day experience that offers both 'Immersive' and 'Broadcast' modes, with the former putting an emphasis on you making the big decisions while the latter allows for a more relaxed experience. 


Perhaps most significantly for long-running players of the series VR support will finally be available on PC for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift players.

Fortnite has played host to countless Marvel characters before, of course, typically timed around their appearances on the big screen or TV shows (the current battle pass includes Doctor Strange, while we were treated to Hawkeye and Kate Bishop late last year). 


Moon Knight's rather fetching skin includes a style with/without his cloak, and an additional style for his Mr. Knight persona. (We won't get into story details here, in case you're yet to start the new series.)

"After careful deliberations, the developers of TERA have unfortunately taken the difficult decision to end development of the game, as they feel that they are no longer able to provide the satisfying content that TERA players deserve. Instead, they would like to focus their internal development efforts on other projects," publisher Gameforge wrote in a statement. 
"Gameforge has happily hosted a great community in TERA for almost 10 years now, and would have happily served players even longer, but without the support of the developers this is not feasible."

Core to the DLC - which aims to give players the opportunity to "truly decide the fate of the [Iberian] peninsula, either by reenacting history or creating an alternative that pleases you more" - is a new system that Paradox is referring to as the Struggle, said to highlight the "unique historical circumstances that typify regions that have been centres of conflict" and "create new opportunities and add constraints" for players in the Iberian peninsula.


Fate of Iberia will include an updated map for the region - refining the county and duchy divisions, as well as cultures and faiths - alongside new events (some specific to Iberia and others adding variety for all players), new Urbane and Coterie Legacy tracks, new Cultural Traditions, plus new friend interactions and duels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports earlier this week that Microsoft is considering introducing ads to free-to-play games on Xbox, a new report has surfaced claiming Sony has been working on its own plan to do the same with its PlayStation games.


As reported by Business Insider (paywall), which cites three people involved with Sony plans as its sources, the company is currently investigating ways to encourage developers to continue making free-to-play games - said to have soared in popularity during the pandemic - by providing new ways to monetise them.


At present, PlayStation's ad inventory is said to be limited to in-menu ads - which can be used by publishers and developers to do things like promote their own games on the PlayStation Store - and ads served via streaming video on certain apps.

Ghostbusters VR

Ghostbusters VR (working title, if you were wondering) brings the 80s movie classic to virtual reality as a four-player co-op adventure promising an "extensive and engrossing" spirit-bothering campaign. Players will need to track, blast, and trap ghosts as they protect San Francisco from the unearthly realm, with developer nDreams aiming to deliver "all the humour and frights from the beloved franchise" when Ghostbusters VR eventually arrives at some currently undisclosed future point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil 4's Mercenaries mode arrives today as part of the Meta Quest 2 version of Capcom's classic, via a free update with brand new content made specifically for this VR version. The announcement came via the just-finished Meta Gaming Showcase event - and you can play the mode for yourself now, or watch our Ian try it for himself just below.

Mercenaries, a wave-based PVE mode found in several Resident Evil titles, is a fan-favourite - and not least in Resident Evil 4, where you face hordes of ganados against the clock while attempting to land a high score. But this fresh version of Mercenaries for Meta Quest 2 includes an array of new options and unlockable extras - including online leaderboards and 20 Challenges which mix up Mercenaries' gameplay in new ways.
Challenges include options which restrict gameplay to just knives or rocket launchers, or shroud the map in fog. Complete these, and you'll gain access to other all-new additions such as a Big Head Mode, speedy Fast Forward mode, and a black-and-white Classic Horror Mode for the main Resi 4 campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ludeon Studios' widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim RimWorld has had its Refused Classification status rescinded in Australia following a successful appeal, meaning its effective ban in the region has been overturned.
The notoriously sensitive Australian Classification Board initially refused to grant RimWorld a rating in March after its publisher Double Eleven Limited submitted the game for an upcoming "multi platform" launch, prohibiting it from release and effectively banning it from sale. The decision even affected the long-available Steam version of RimWorld, preventing new purchases from being made on Valve's digital store.
No specific reason was given for the board's decision at the time, with its website only referencing its usual boilerplate copy for games refused a rating, saying RC titles are those that "depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified."

Huzzah!
"PC players can now update their DualSense wireless controller with the latest firmware from Windows 11 and select Windows 10 devices, without connecting to a PS5," Sony announced today. 
In order to do this, you will need to download the Firmware updater for DualSense wireless controller app (catchy name) to your Windows PC. When this app is loaded, all you will then need to do to get all the latest updates on your controller is use a USB cable to connect said controller to your PC, and then just follow the on-screen instructions and you're away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been nearly five months since the troubled Marvel's Avengers last received a new playable character - the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man - but there's finally good news for those wondering when the drought might end: developer Crystal Dynamics has confirmed another superhero is on the way, this time in the form of Jane Foster, the Mighty Thor.


Details on Foster's video game iteration are limited at this early juncture in Crystal Dynamics' reveal, but the developer has confirmed the character will have "a lot in common" with the version of Thor already in-game. Don't expect a carbon copy, however; "elements that are distinctly Jane" are also promised for her eventual arrival.


Exactly when that might be, though, is unclear. Crystal Dynamic offered no timeline for the new playable character in its recent blog post, only confirming Foster will release as part of Marvel's Avengers' 2.5 update and that more details will be shared "in the future".

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate &#8220;backdoor key&#8221;, the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees. ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

More specifically, Coiled Captors sends players on an adventure deep inside an icy mountain - where they'll find "wintery wastelands, arid ruins, and flooding caverns" - and it's here they'll be tasked with freeing an old god from within the body of a mighty shark-like seawarg, via the time-honoured Borderlands tradition of killing it to death.


Gearbox describes Coiled Captors - which can be accessed via Vesper's first Mirror of Mystery - as a "repayable dungeon challenge", explaining that as well as dealing with fierce resistance from the snake-like members of the Coiled, a secretive sect that worships ancient gods, players will need to tackle the four powerful forms of the DLC's captive old god, Chums.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has detailed World of Warcraft's next expansion, Dragonflight, which will be taking adventurers on a journey to the long-lost Dragon Isles, and introducing a new playable race-class hybrid and flyable dragons along the way. Additionally, the developer has confirmed 2008's Wrath of the Lich King expansion will come to World of Warcraft Classic later this year.


First, Dragonflight, which grants access to the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind, the Dragon Isles, recently reawakened following a period of calamity for Azeroth. This new region - described as lush and primal, bursting with elemental energy - will incorporate everything from icy wastes and magma areas to lush forests and vibrant coasts across its four standard areas (bringing the likes of new dungeons and raids) and new starting zone. 


The Dragon Isles starting area is home to the Dracthyr Evokers, a new playable race-class hybrid that will begin their WoW journey at level 58 and can align with either the Horde or the Alliance. Evokers will have two customisable forms - their draconic avatars used in battle, plus humanoid forms deployed when interacting with Azeroth's inhabitants - and, depending on players' chosen class specialisations, can either focus on damage dealing or healing.

North was a guest on Couch Soup this weekend, as hosts Liam McIntyre and Todd Lasance began their playthrough of Uncharted 4. Just before the opening sequences began rolling, North was asked more about how this final version of the game came about. Clearly not wanting to shy away from the elephant in the room, North went straight into chatting about Hennig, and the changes made after she left the game's development.
"The biggest thing most people probably remember is... we had shot Uncharted 4 with Amy Hennig for about seven months. We were well into the game. And she was dismissed from Naughty Dog... and they got rid of everything we did," North recalled.

Hennig, memorably, spent three years working on Project Ragtag, the ill-fated Star Wars game left "on the shelf" by EA after developer Visceral Games was shut down. 


The project is the second major game in the works at Skydance New Media, Hennig's new studio, which is also working on an unannounced action-adventure game based around a Marvel property.

"I am not getting any younger," Wolpaw told KiwiTalkz (thanks, Kotaku). "We are reaching the point where it's crazy to think [the original development team is] literally going to be too old to work on Portal 3, so we should just do it."


Unfortunately, Wolpaw acknowledged the business considerations of Valve focusing a chunk of its workforce on a Portal 3 - especially when the company had the money-printing Steam and hugely successful Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to run instead.

Now, Gilbert has also revealed his new game in the series will start off where Monkey Island: LeChuck's Revenge finished – at an amusement park.
"One of the things that was very important to me about this was that I did want the game to start right at the end of Monkey Island 2, when you walk into that amusement park. I wanted the game to start there," Gilbert told Adventure Gamers.
"That was kind of my one criteria: we need to start the game there. I don't want to go into all the details of it, but we do start there, and then it takes lots of weird twists and turns that you would expect from us."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring players are getting soft banned for picking up pants dropped by other players.

As previously reported, players discovered a cut pair of underwear in the game. The Deathbed Smalls were meant to be part of the NPC Fia's armour set, but are unobtainable without hacking the game.


But hacks and mods cannot be used without by-passing the game's anti-cheat system. And simply owning the pants - even if obtained by another player - is seemingly enough to trigger a soft ban.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason Momoa, known for his hulking and somewhat imposing roles in Game of Thrones, Dune and Justice League, is on the cusp of landing his newest role. But this time, it seems the muscular lead will be taking on a much blockier persona than we are used to seeing, as The Hollywood Reporter has reported Momoa is currently in "final talks" for Warner Bros.' live-action Minecraft adaptation.
While his part is not set in stone (cuboid or otherwise), it certainly looks hopeful. So, will he be Steve, or a whole new hero? Or even, the villain? I guess we will have to wait and see.
Along with some potential Mamoa-ness, Variety has additionally revealed the upcoming Minecraft film has also landed Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess as its director. Meanwhile, Dune producer Mary Parent will produce the film, alongside Roy Lee.

"We understand that this is a major issue, and are prioritising our investigation into the matter," Yoshida said. "We are working to identify the issue in the corresponding program; however, as the process is very complex and there are many patterns involved for the lottery conditions, it will require some time to pinpoint the problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prolific dataminer Lance McDonald has discovered a deleted NPC questline in Elden Ring.

According to McDonald, if you visited Stormhill Shack - which had previously been known as Scavenger's Shack and is today the location where you'll meet Roderika - during the network test, it was empty. Before that test, however, it looks like it was the home to an unknown NPC called Monk Jigo.

As spotted by PC Gamer, Jigo had been "seduced by the good lady alcohol" and needed your help to gather the ingredients for Dreambrew, a magical booze that, shared with other NPCs, would unlock bonus dialogue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An update to the Steam backend has fans speculating that Among Us VR may be released in December 2022.

While this is by no means definite - even the SteamDB listing, which leaked the date, clearly states that the "Steam API release date [...] may be wrong" - the update was changed on 15th April 2022, amended from 10th November to 13th December, 2022 (thanks, PCGN).

While either date could be a placeholder, of course, the good news is that we probably don't have to wait that long to find out exactly what the release date will be; Innersloth has confirmed it'll be at Facebook's Meta Quest Gaming Showcase this coming Wednesday, and the hope is we'll find out one way or the other then. We'll keep you posted.

Launching on 19th April, Unshackled will include the return of Flashpoint, where the ability to regenerate health and shield is removed, along with healing and shield loot. Instead you must get to Flashpoint zones to regen health although, as you may well expect, you may have to fight for control of it…

There's also the usual new themed cosmetics  - badges, charms, skins, and the like - and new weekly challenges to take on, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[China is reportedly stepping up its regulations around streaming "unauthorised" video games.

As reported by Reuters (thanks, PC Gamer), Chinese government agency The National Radio and Television Administration has justified the move by insisting that "for a period of time, issues such as chaotic online livestreaming and teenage addiction to games have raised widespread concerns in society and effective measures need to be taken urgently".

The statement seemingly comes after some fans were able to view games China deems as "unauthorised" - such as Elden Ring - via Chinese streaming platforms, even though many are not available to buy in the country.

It was Sony itself that sparked speculation after a ResetEra user noticed that the banner topping PlayStation Studios' website had been updated to include Sam Bridges from Kojima's Death Stranding game. 
The banner also included a shot of Bluepoint's Demon's Soul remake, which was acquired by Sony last year. Despite the fervour, the banner has not been taken down, suggesting its change was neither premature nor accidental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Rise's Sunbreak expansion is drawing ever-nearer to its June release on PC and Switch, and, in anticipation of its eventual arrival, Capcom has offered a closer look at its new Citadel map and new armoured monkey monster Garangolm in action.


Come Sunbreak's release, players will have the opportunity to depart for new climes, with the bustling port town of Elgado Outpost serving as the expansion's colourful new hub area. From there, it's just a short hop to Sunbreak's brand-new map, The Citadel - which combines a diverse range of biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece.


Capcom describes The Citadel - said to be a once thriving, but now devastated part of the kingdom, slowly being reclaimed by nature - as a "key location" for Sunbreak's new Master Rank quests in its video showcase, taking viewers on tour of the castle and its surroundings biomes, as well as offering a glimpse of the location's new endemic life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With season 3 of Netflix's The Witcher adaptation now officially in production, the streaming service is beginning to loosen its lips about what's in store, and that includes casting news for four characters being introduced as part of the series' third outing.


Netflix confirmed filming on season 3 was officially underway earlier this month, sharing a behind-the-scenes shot of the show's Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri (that is, Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan) on-set and in the snow. It also offered a brief summary of where things will be heading following the conclusion of last season, revealing that it'll see Geralt taking Ciri of Cintra into hiding.


"Entrusted with Ciri’s magical training," the streaming service explained, "Yennefer leads them to the protected fortress of Aretuza, where she hopes to discover more about the girl’s untapped powers; instead, they discover they’ve landed in a battlefield of political corruption, dark magic, and treachery."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following recent claims developer Criterion's new Need for Speed game could be launching as soon as November, it's now been reported the racer will be set in a fictional version of Chicago and will combine a "photo-realistic" art style with "anime elements".
That's according to VentureBeat’s Jeff Grubb, who discussed the long-awaited project in the latest episode of his Grubbsnax show. Elaborating on his claims the new Need for Speed would "be photo-realistic, but it’s going to have on top of that, anime elements", Grubb (as thanks VGC) explained, "You know when you see a car commercial or something like that and the car’s driving around, but then cartoons flames and stuff are flying off it? That’s the kind of the aesthetic that they seem to be going for."
Away fron Need for Speed's new visual style, Grubb also claimed the racer will take place in a fictionalised version of Chicago, known as Lake Shore City, and that various familiar features would be returning for this latest Need for Speed instalment. These are said to include Autolog and its multiplayer focused social tools, plus the ability to "customise all the pieces of your car".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its latest earnings report, CD Projekt has confirmed Cyberpunk 2077's previously announced paid expansion - which the developer says will deliver a "new storyline" - is now expected to arrive next year, and that additional DLC is in the works.


Details on Cyberpunk 2077's paid story expansion have remained limited following CD Projekt's decision to switch its development focus to fixing the base game in response to its disastrous launch at the tail-end of 2020. The developer had originally intended to discuss its expansion plans prior to the game's release, meaning additional information is long overdue.


Mentions of Cyberpunk 2077's expansion have been sporadic at best since launch, but it seems CD Projekt is now ready to discuss it in slightly more definite terms, with the developer confirming, unsurprisingly, that it'll feature a "new storyline", and that it'll be launching in 2023. That's all it's saying for now, however, with more information due to be shared "later this year".

Inspired by Eurogamer's best games of 2022 so far list, and ahead of a long weekend of gaming here in the UK, now's a good time to chat about what has kept us interested this spring. 


Horizon: Forbidden West arrived with huge fanfare, and seems like it did a good job of providing more of the original's sense of adventure - but did it fall a little flat in the face of Elden Ring? January saw the launch of the new PS5 version of Uncharted: Lost Legacy - but what's next for the biggest of Sony's blockbuster franchises?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amnesia: Rebirth, the third outing in developer Frictional Games' historical horror series, will be next week's free Epic Store game, alongside couch-based co-op dungeon-crawler Riverbond.


Rebirth - which follows on from Frictional's 2010 original and its Chinese-Room-developed successor A Machine for Pigs - whisks players back to the 1930s for an unsettling adventure across the Algerian desert. This time around, the focus is on protagonist Tasi Trianon as she attempts to navigate the sandy, hostile expanse, piecing together fragments of her past (and occasionally dealing with unspeakable horrors) along the way. 


Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake called Rebirth an "impressive horror subversion" and a story that "gripped me right up until the credits rolled" when she reviewed it back in 2020, so it's an outing that's well worth your time - and there's even an Adventure Mode that cuts back on the suffocating darkness, jump scares, and deadly monsters for faint-hearted players that just want to dabble in its puzzling and engaging story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release date of Call of Duty Warzone and Vanguard's new season has been announced with a new cinematic trailer that appears to hint the arrival of something more sinister. 


Season three, Classified Arms, is set to release on the 27th April with the franchise's connected universe storyline progressing with the release of "Nebula bombs" by the Nazis. 


But the cinematic trailer also teases something bigger: "With Nebula, the Nazis had unwittingly shaken something awake, something far more powerful and fearsome than anything we could ever hope to comprehend."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scarlet Nexus has seen its player base boosted by a million players from Xbox Game Pass, publisher Bandai Namco said today. 
The announcement came as the game passed the two million player figure overall - with the other million coming from 1m copies shipped to retailers and sold digitally (thanks, RPGSite).
It's intriguing to see the RPG gain such a large reach through Microsoft's subscription service - at a time when the power of being included in these has been under the spotlight. The action RPG was added to Game Pass back in September last year.

PlayStation Trophy data for this new addition has been detailed in a new video from Access the Animus, which suggests based on prior release timings we should see the new content go live within the next couple of weeks.


Dubbed "Mastery Challenge: The Reckoning (Part 2)" this is expected to add fresh combat challenge maps to rinse and repeat for high scores, and hopefully some closure to what the mode's vendor Hildiran is really up to.

The Chinese-language video originated on YouTube before being shared by popular Overwatch personality (coach and streamer) Stylosa.
In it, we get a HUD-less montage showing what Sojourn - Overwatch's first black female character - can do. We see her dual-purpose gun, which has what looks like a machine-gun primary fire and a railgun alternate fire. And judging by the video, the railgun is deadly and potentially passes through enemies too.

Scrabble Web, as this new online version of the classic word game is sensibly and unfussily known, delivers all the letter-plopping thrills of the board game original, albeit it in a free, easily accessible new digital guise. And while it might be relatively low on frills right now, it does at least feature a fairly solid range of options when it comes to ways to play.
For starters, there's a solo mode, pitting players against an AI opponent, but also some competitive PvP for those that prefer to test their word prowess against living, breathing challengers - be they randoms or friends - all served up in selectable flavours of match length, lasting between 3 and 45 minutes.

All this would be made available as both a standalone version and as a free upgrade to those that already owned the game on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
It was a generous offer, but very little has been heard of the project since, with CD Projekt only intermittently mentioning it - usually in conjunction with word of another delay - as it continued its attempts to manage the fallout from Cyberpunk 2077's disastrous launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Niantic's next game involves caring for and breeding fictional creatures - but it's nothing to do with Pokémon. Instead, Peridot is a brand new creation by Niantic itself - the company's first for many years - and one it's aiming at an even wider audience.


With Peridot, Niantic seems to be gunning for the now-vacant Neopets market (RIP Neopets), with cutesy Pixar-esque characters, Tamagotchi-style gameplay and - because this is a Niantic game - a good old nudge every so often to get you off your sofa.


"We want it to be a standalone pet simulation game," producer Ziah Fogel told Eurogamer this week via Zoom call, when asked why it was building a new app separate to Pokémon Go. Niantic's mission here, she continued, was to iterate on and improve the popular pet simulation genre. You'll be able to try it for yourself soon, too - it arrives in soft launch in certain countries within the next few weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The California Department of Fair Employment's ongoing harassment and discrimination lawsuit against Activision Blizzard - which accused the publisher of fostering a "frat boy culture" in which sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive - has taken another dramatic turn. A state of California lawyer involved in the lawsuit has resigned, accusing the state's governor of interfering in the case in support of Activision Blizzard.


As reported by Bloomberg, the assistant chief counsel for California’s Department of Fair Employment, Melanie Proctor, has quit her role in protest after California Governor Gavin Newsom "abruptly fired" the agency's boss, Chief Counsel Janette Wipper. A representative for the two attorneys has since confirmed the firing and resignation to Bloomberg.


In an email to staff seen by the publication, Proctor claimed Governor Gavin Newsom and his office had begun to "interfere" with the Activision lawsuit in recent weeks. “The Office of the Governor repeatedly demanded advance notice of litigation strategy and of next steps in the litigation,” Proctor wrote. “As we continued to win in state court, this interference increased, mimicking the interests of Activision’s counsel.”

Well, wonder no more, as someone has brought these two pieces of media together as one, and I won’t lie, it is a match made in (a far from angelic) heaven. 
Using footage from 1987’s Evil Dead 2 and 1992’s Army of Darkness, content creator eli_handle_b․wav has replaced Resident Evil Village protagonist Ethan Winters with Ash. The results are both horrifying and amusing all in one. 
Instead of ripping himself free from Lady Dimitrescu’s clutches a la Ethan, this rendition of Village sees new hero Ash instead shimmying up to his towering captor and offering to open a bottle of champagne (I mean, someone was going to do it eventually, just look at her).

"My first [MMORPG] was EverQuest. I got absolutely addicted to it and forced a dozen or so SquareSoft staff members at the time to play as well, telling them it was required knowledge. Incredibly, most of them got hooked too, which led to [Final Fantasy 11]," he said.

Chatting to Xbox Expansion Pass, Lanning said his team initially thought they would sell roughly 50k units of Oddworld: Soulstorm, and certainly no more than 100k. The studio was also looking for some financial help to keep the game alive, and as such, when Sony approached the team offering an undisclosed amount of money to put its game on PS Plus for its release month, Lanning jumped at the chance. 
However, the game's release was delayedby three months due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. And with the game's later release, Lanning said, more people than previously estimated now had access to a PlayStation 5.

Unfortunately, this cute toy has caught the attention of scalpers looking to resell the figure for plenty of credits on its own. You can't get this version of the minifigure anywhere else - and this is driving up its price on eBay (thanks, Nintendo Life).

Thanks to facial reconstruction technology, Twitter user Sulkalmakh from the Ancestral Whispers cranial reconstruction research team brought Skyrim's bony boys to life, as it were.
In a playful tweet from April Fool's Day (via IGN), the user shared their "Facial reconstruction of an ancient Atmoran from Saarthal, dated to the late Merethic Era". This may well have gone over the heads of many, but eagle-eyed fans were soon quick to realise that the face staring back at them on the screen was indeed that of a (now fully fleshed) Skyrim Skeleton.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny developer Bungie has committed to a new "digital-first" hiring policy, and said that "most current and future roles will be fully remote eligible". 


The move contrasts with recent pushes from companies such as Call of Duty maker Activision and League of Legends studio Riot Games, who seem keener to get staff back in offices - leading to Covid safety concerns. 


Bungie has said it will allow remote work from a number of US states (likely due to local tax laws - thanks, Kotaku) including the developer's home of Washington, plus others including California, Florida and Texas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo support studio Certain Affinity has said it is "deepening" its relationship with the series' main developer 343 Industries, and is now at work on "evolving" Halo Infinite further. 


Certain Affinity has assisted with Halo development as far back as Halo 2, where it worked on extra maps for that game. Subsequently, it has served as a co-developer for 343 on Halo Waypoint, Reach, Halo 4 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.


Its continued work on the series with Halo Infinite comes as little surprise, then, but the language it has used - and an earlier report on what it might be up to - point to a major addition to Infinite coming from Certain Affinity in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been itching to turn to the darker side in No Man's Sky, developer Hello Games' exploratory space sim has you covered in its new Outlaws update, giving players the chance to trade their life of relatively wholesome interplanetary meandering and base building for one of rather more criminal pursuits as they take on the role of fearsome space pirates.


Just as February's Sentinels update sought to improve ground combat, Outlaws aims to do the same for space combat. That means better ship handling, shields for enemy starships, plus visual enhancements and various specialist secondary effects for weapons. The latter for instance, might give players the ability to slow enemy engines or disable their shield systems. Additionally, combat can now move down into a planet's atmosphere and AI pirates can even attack your settlements - and if all that sounds a little intimidating, Hello Games has introduced a new Auto-Follow mode to improve combat accessibility.


Elsewhere, there's a brand-new class of ship in the form of the sleek, solar-powered, and rather unimaginatively named Solar Starship (plus the maximum number of ships players can store has now been increased to nine), and it's now possible to create squadrons, recruiting and upgrading AI wingmen, each with their own unique abilities, for assistance in battle. Oh, and all ships now have high-capacity (and expandable) cargo inventories for specialist goods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has provided additional details of next week's World of Warcraft expansion reveal, confirming the event - previously announced to be airing on Tuesday, 19th April - will commence at 5pm BST/6pm CEST/9am PT/12pm ET.


"World of Warcraft has ignited imaginations through rich storytelling and expansive worlds that prevail throughout the Shadowlands expansion," Blizzard wrote in an its announcement of today's news. "From the hopeless depths of the Maw to the ethereal plains of Zereth Mortis, the Shadowlands delivers a world that challenges heroes to confront the forces that threaten to upset the cosmic balance between life and death. With the story in the Shadowlands coming to a conclusion, the time is at hand to get a sneak peek at what’s next for the heroes of Azeroth."


As for what maybe next for the long-running MMO, that's still somewhat unclear, but Warcraft-focused website Wowhead reports (thanks VGC) that data found in the source code of the official World of Warcraft website suggests the new expansion will be called Dragonflight, with Base, Heroic, and Epic Expansion pre-pruchases seemingly set to become available following next week's reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last March, John Wick director Chad Stahelski announced he was working on a movie adaptation of PlayStation samurai adventure Ghost of Tsushima, and now, a little over a year later, a writer for the project has been named.
As reported by Deadline, the new Ghost of Tsushima film adaptation will be penned by Takashi Doscher, who previously wrote and directed romantic sci-fi romance, Only, alongside ESPN documentary A Fighting Chance.
Deadline says the adaptation is still in "early development" and, as such, details remain scarce. However, the publication previously confirmed the project - a collaboration between Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions - will, perhaps unsurprisingly, follow the adventures of game protagonist Jin Sakai. Will there be Hot Spring butt? Only time will tell.

        <updated>2022-04-12T20:42:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beamdog, the developer perhaps best known for its remasters of Black Isle Studios classics such as Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment, has unveiled MythForce, a new first-person fantasy rogue-lite inspired by the Saturday morning cartoons of the 80s.
First things first, MythForce looks kind of glorious, doing an admirable job of capturing the ambiance of any number of 80s cartoon favourites, albeit rendered in full 3D. There's a definite air of the fondly remembered Dungeons & Dragons' animated outing about it, for instance (with a little bit of arcade cult-classic Dragon's Lair thrown in), which is entirely fitting given Beamdog describes its game as a first-person swords & sorcery adventure.
At MythForce's core is a roguelite dungeon-crawling experience that sees up to four co-op players - in the role of either Victoria the valiant Knight, Rico the charming Rogue, Maggie the wise Mage, and Hawkins the deadly Hunter - storming a colourful cartoon castle packed with "treasure, traps, and terrors". Beamdog is promising to arm players with "legendary weapons and powerful magic" as they attempt to survive the forces of evil within.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring's late-game bosses are tough, so what better way to ease the pain of FromSoftware latest epic than by cutting out the middle man and getting one boss to fight another boss on your behalf? We've already had one such showdown before, pitting Malenia against Starcourge Radahn (and his pal Leonard the horse), and the victor of that skirmish is now back, this time taking on Maliketh, the Black Blade.


This latest battle of Elden Ring's elite comes courtesy of the Garden of Eyes, the same modder that bought Malenia face to face with Radahn (and that also pitted Bloodborne's Lady Maria against Resident Evil Village's Lady Dimitrescu), this time promising the "ultimate battle of the Shardbearers" and delivering a whole lot of pyrotechnics as the two fight it out.


Those who've yet to enter the gauntlet of carefully curated misery that makes up Elden Ring's final stretch will obviously want to steer clear of Garden of Eyes' latest head-to-head for obvious spoiler reasons, but those eager to see who reigns victorious this time around simply need to watch the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you feel like you need to see even more of Master Chief's derriere after his naked TV debut last week, well I have good news - there is a mod that lets you play Halo Infinite in third person.
The PC mod in question comes from Opulent Halo (via PC Gamer). While the mod is actually a few months old now, many have been recently diving back into Halo Infinite to see how Master Chief (at least his video game form) looks from this new angle. Perhaps Paramount has whetted some appetites?
In a video showing off the mod in action, the creator wrote, "after my novice modding skills in Halo Infinite, I wondered what third person would look like... [spoiler alert] it's amazing".

That's exactly what YouTuber Flurdeh has done. Using camera tools by Frans Bouma, they've used a tilt shift lens and isometric view to create a video of the Lands Between from above (thanks PC Gamer).


Though not a full mod, it somewhat reimagines the game as a CRPG, Miyazaki's bleak world becoming adorable little dioramas with tiny model enemies shuffling around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have lifted the curtain on their new action-adventure IP, Hell is Us. 
In a joint press release, the companies gave a brief and somewhat haunting synopsis for the game. "The almost total self-sufficiency of the country hides a dark secret: the recent appearance of supernatural creatures resembling ancient headstones and monuments in the region,” the Hell is Us team explained. "The citizens call this phenomenon 'the Calamity'. Armed with weapons specially forged to fight these monsters, the protagonist must learn how to defeat them and use his equipment wisely."
To accompany this announcement, a new teaser for Hell is Us was also debuted. This trailer gives off strong Kojima vibes, and shows off the game's dystopian country, which is ravaged by civil war. In the words of Ed Nightingale, "It’s like Death Stranding with a sword". You can check out the trailer for yourself below.

The feature will let anyone on PC, Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S play these games' campaigns co-operatively online together.


In patch notes, developer 343 Industries said the cross-play had been tested internally - though the company now needed "additional insight from real players with different networking setups". If you experience issues, you're encouraged to report them so 343 can improve the feature further.

The new building (red in the diagram below) will sit next to other Nintendo buildings (in pink) and be open by the end of December 2027 (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). Maybe we'll have Switch 3 by then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wingspan, the rather lovely digital adaptation of Stonemaier Games' equally lovely bird-themed board game, will be ushering a fresh flock of avians into its welcoming habitats from 5th May, come the launch of its first major gameplay DLC, the European Expansion.


Wingspan's European Expansion builds on the core game's soothing, strategic deck building - which Eurogamer's Robert Purchese was rather taken with when he first put it through its paces some time back now - by introducing 81 new bird cards from the European area, each accompanied by a recording of its actual sound.


These new birds will bring a range of fresh abilities for use during play - such as the option to steal other players' food, to place cards on already played cards, and to reset the bird feeder - and you'll find a little more in the way of specifics on the official European Expansion website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has confirmed a sequel to its Arcade Stadium retro compilation is on the way - consisting of 32 more classic titles - after references to a follow-up were spotted on the South Korean game classification website earlier this month.


Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium, as the sequel is known, will follow the same modular release model as its predecessor, consisting of a free base download that includes one game and offering additional titles to purchase from within the collection. Quite why Capcom has decided a sequel is necessary, given the modular, expandable nature of the original, is currently unclear.


"The second Capcom Arcade Stadium title featuring a recreated arcade full of authentic cabinets to play", is how the publisher describes the sequel in a reference on Steam, promising "a new lineup of masterpieces!". And in a seperate tweet, it's now confirmed that lineup will total 32 arcade classics when it comes to Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC this June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New figures show that player numbers for DICE's Battlefield 2042 keep on falling, with less than 1000 concurrent users playing via Steam this morning.
A thread on ResetEra revealed that as few as 979 players were shown to be taking part in the game on Steam earlier today, with a peak of 2411 players in the last 24 hours. In comparison, 2018’s Battlefield 5 had a peak of 20,913 players over the same 24-hour period.
These numbers are pretty dire for such a relatively new game, especially one in such a longstanding series, but at this point aren't a surprise. After all, in November, Vikki reported that Battlefield 2042 was one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time, with one user stating the game's “issues are endless”.

TT Games' epic compilation of all nine films is the UK's second-biggest boxed launch of the year so far, behind Pokémon Legends Arceus.

This new record was achieved by Distortion 2, who has previously achieved and broken many other Elden Ring speed running records. This included the game's first sub-20 run in March.
20 minutes now seems like eons for the streamer, as their new record is an impressive 8 minutes and 56 seconds.

Interestingly, this makes it Jim Carrey's biggest domestic opener ever, eclipsing 2003's Bruce Almighty which grossed $68m during it's opening weekend in the States. It also marks Paramount's fifth number-one movie of the pandemic, too.

As Tom summarised for us earlier this week, eFootball - the new name for PES - arrived in a disastrous state late last year, even though Konami warned players it would arrive in extremely limited form akin to a demo.
Now, however, the beleaguered publisher has acknowledged the "incompletion" of the game to our sister site VGC, pointing the finger to several factors it believes contributed to the game's dreadful reception on release.

Angels of the Zariman focuses its multitude of new additions around the lore-critical Zariman Ten Zero, an Orokin ship that vanished during a Void-Jump accident. Front and centre of the update is a new instalment in Warframe's single-player, story driven Cinematic Quest saga, which this time sets the scene by taking Tenno aboard the Zariman Ten Zero.
Then, once the mission is complete, players will gain access to Chrysalith, a new social hub onboard the Zariman, which introduces a range of new NPC, side missions, and objectives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tired of those infernal video games, always insisting on being so darned interactive? Well, developer Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology) has you covered in its next horror title The Quarry, which comes with its very own Movie Mode.


Movie Mode, just as it sounds, lets players (or rather viewers, in this instance) watch the entirety of The Quarry's summer-camp-flavoured horror in linear, non-interactive fashion - meaning you can simply plop your bot on the sofa, grab your popcorn with two controller-free hands, and soak up its scares with only minimal exertions from yourself.


As detailed in a new IGN preview (thanks PC Gamer), The Quarry's Movie Mode will come in three different flavours: Everybody Lives, Everybody Dies, and Director's Chair. The first two are pretty self-explanatory, determining whether The Quarry's cast members - including the likes of Lance Henriksen, Grace Zabriskie, David Arquette, Ted Raimi, Justice Smith, and Skyler Gisondo - manage to survive their experience at Hackett's Quarry summer camp to live another day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Criterion's new Need for Speed game, which was delayed at the start of last year while the studio assisted the development of Battlefield 2042, will reportedly launch this November, skipping previous game consoles to instead focus on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

 
EA confirmed a new Criterion-developed Need for Speed game was in the works at the tail-end of 2020, slapping it with a vague release window of somewhere between April 2021 and the end of March this year. However, that launch was later delayed to EA's fiscal year 2023, with the publisher announcing it had made the decision to move Criterion away from Need for Speed to help DICE "deliver the best [Battlefield] experience possible to our players".


With Battlefield 2042 now launched, Criterion's attention has reportedly returned to Need for Speed, with EA said to be looking to release its long-awaited racer this November. That's according to VentureBeat's Jeff Grubb who, speaking in the latest episode his GrubbSnax show (thanks WCCF Tech), also claimed this latest series instalment will forego a console release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, instead targeting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

But it remained unclear how well the game had performed commercially, and in February, publisher Square Enix said the title had "undershot expectations".
Ahead of the BAFTA video game awards last night, I sat down with members of the Guardians of the Galaxy team to discuss the game's emotional storytelling, where the series could go next - and some unexpected tussles with racoons. 
But first, the issue of those sales - on which, the team said it had "no regrets".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pirate Legends yearning for some adventure to really test their nautical prowess will finally get their wish from 21st April, when Sea of Thieves launches Legend of the Veil - a brand-new, story driven quest designed exclusively for the piratical cream of the crop.


Rare initially teased Legend of the Veil during its Sea of Thieves' 2022 roadmap reveal back in January, and with a release date for the adventure now confirmed, the developer has shared more on what players can expect to see come its arrival.


While Sea of Thieves' existing Pirate-Legend-focused Athena Voyages are little more than a clutch of Trading Company tasks strung together into one lengthy quest, Legend of the Veil is aiming to be rather more ambitious, blending the cinematic presentation of previous Tall Tales adventures - complete with cut-scenes, music, and voice work - with the randomness and replayability of standard voyages.

XCOM 2 is, of course, a bit of a winner, refining the base-building, alien-annihilating turn-based tactics of its 2012 predecessor (itself a refinement of Julian Gollop's classic X-COM series) to create a prettier, tougher, richer game of extraterrestrial slaughter.


As Chris Bratt put it in his 2016 review, "XCOM 2 isn't a reworking of the original game...it's a genuine response to it... Moment to moment, the thing that makes this astonishing game truly sing is the way in which it's managed to respond to the bad habits we picked up last time around. Move faster, it urges. Take more risks. Become a more interesting player."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has highlighted staff concerns at Riot Games, as the League of Legends developer has begun encouraging staff back into its Los Angeles-based office.


Employees told Vice that Riot's decision to drop its mask mandate and stop testing for unvaccinated employees put them at risk, as hybrid working with three days in the office per week was being encouraged as the new norm. 


Today's report comes just a week after similar criticisms and staff walkouts at Activision, which also has studios in California. Both companies said the changes reflected their state's recent relaxation in Covid safety rules - despite rising case numbers due to the Omicron BA2 subvariant.

Chatting with me about all this - and what we'd like to see revived next - are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy. We discuss playing as a digital Sam Lake, mangle poor Guybrush's name, and hum the F-Zero theme tune.

The operation copied and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that Sandworm used for command and control (C2) of the underlying botnet. Although the operation did not involve access to the Sandworm malware on the thousands of underlying victim devices worldwide, referred to as &#8220;bots,&#8221; the disabling of the C2 mechanism severed those bots from the Sandworm C2 devices&#8217; control. ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Derrickson and Cargill were snapped up by Marvel to make Doctor Strange, and without the duo onboard, production company CBS Films lost interest and moved on.

Developer Blizzard has not yet commented on the change, though fans have spotted the "Z" has now disappeared in the game's most recent update (thanks, PC Gamer).
It's not hard to guess why this change has occured now. The "Z" symbol has recently become co-opted by Putin-supporting Russian citizens and emblazoned on military vehicles currently involved in the country's devastating invasion of Ukraine.

But as is to be expected from a Resident Evil game, these mermaids were not going to be the Disney princess versions akin to the likes of Ariel and her family. Rather, they were going to a (literal) monstrous pain for Ethan Winters and players.
Reliable Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem, who has a record of insider knowledge on the series' development, has shared more details on Moreau’s area within the game, as well as the enemies players would encounter there. When discussing the mermaid like enemies that were ultimately cut from the final release, Dusk Golem revealed:

For example, you can't kill children in the game - and players have found that by chaining lightsaber attacks against these invulnerable younglings, you can essentially levitate and hover to places you'd normally struggle to reach. 


Specifically, people are beating up little Episode 1-era Anakin Skywalker, who will simply glow red from repeated lightsaber damage. (Normally, whacking your party members with lightsabers sends them tumbling apart into their Lego components.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first big fix for Gran Turismo 7's launch issues – chiefly its grim grind made all the more unpalatable by the presence of microtransactions – is now live, boosting payouts for campaign and online events and making some other welcome changes along the way. 
New events have been introduced, with big races at Le Mans, Sardegna and Tokyo Expressway slotting in alongside other tweaked races towards the end of the campaign that now all deliver bigger payouts. There are new 1 hour endurance events available once you've reached Collector Level 23 – all coming under 'The Human Comedy' banner, which is rather apt for the discipline – while online events will also now offer bigger payouts. Elsewhere the in-game credit cap has been lifted and more legendary cars will be listed in the auction house at any one time. 
And there's more! Off-road physics, which were a bit waywards, have now been grounded, some graphical tweaks have taken place and plenty more besides – you can see the full rundown of what's new in Gran Turismo 7 version 1.11 in the extensive patchnotes.

As Kubernetes evolves, features and APIs are regularly revisited and removed. New features may offer
an alternative or improved approach to solving existing problems, motivating the team to remove the
old approach. Old APIs are first deprecated and then removed according to the Kubernetes Deprecation Policy.
We want to make sure you are aware of the changes coming in the Kubernetes 1.24 release. The release will
deprecate several (beta) APIs in favor of stable versions of the same APIs. The major change coming
in the Kubernetes 1.24 release is the removal of Dockershim. This is discussed
below and will be explored in more depth at release time. For an early look at the changes coming in Kubernetes 1.24, take a look at the in-progress CHANGELOG.

The way Pokémon Go has handled Mega Evolution - a popular mechanic from the monster franchise's main games - has been criticised since its arrival in August 2020, although it has been improved over time. 


These upcoming potential changes - which, to be clear, are yet to be finalised and announced by developer Niantic - seem like they'll go a lot further to address recurrent gripes and encourage more regular Mega Evolution as part of daily play.

eFootball - the new name for PES - arrived in a disastrous state late last year, despite Konami warning players it would arrive in extremely limited form akin to a demo. 


Konami insisted the game would evolve over time, but players have been left waiting months for this v1.0.0 update to arrive. In the meantime, eFootball's mobile spin-off was postponed, and the game's controversial premium player pack was pulled from sale.

While not enough to trouble the likes of perenial Steam favourites, or rival the enormous Steam launch of Elden Ring, it is worth pointing out how good a launch Lego Star Wars has had compared to other games in the series.


The Skywalker Saga hit an 82,445 player peak on its launch day,  compared to numbers around the ~5000 player mark for Marvel Super Heroes, The Hobbit, Ninjago and Lord of the Rings (thanks, BenjiSales).

Mining, cave exploration and combat also feature, alongside expanded customisation options for your home. Here's a new trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After its game-changing reveal on PlayStation 5 and following a period of early access, Unreal Engine 5 is finally available for general download. In combination with the release, Epic is releasing a cut-down, Keanu-free rendition of the remarkable The Matrix Awakens demo alongside a sample game project to experiment with, called Lyra. UE5's release takes centre stage in today's State of Unreal virtual event, and we're told to expect a range of tech deep dives surrounding the technology alongside the launch of the engine itself.


UE5 takes the established Unreal Engine 4.27 and adds full support for a number of key next generation technologies. We've already seen these in action, of course. Lumen is Epic's take on a fully real-time global illumination solution, eliminating the need to rely on static, pre-calculated 'baked' lighting, leaning into hardware accelerated ray tracing where appropriate. Nanite is UE5's virtualised micro-polygon technology, delivering incredibly granular detail from assets of motion picture quality and the elimination of geometry 'pop-in'. 


The demands of these systems are such that native rendering at 4K resolution is not feasible on today's game consoles and that ties into another key feature: Temporal Super Resolution. Recently seen for the first time in a non-UE5 title – Ghostwire: Tokyo – TSR is the best software-based temporal upscaling solution we've seen to date. In upscaling from a native 1080p to 4K – a 2x resolution boost on both axes – the quality is comparable (if not quite as good as) Nvidia's DLSS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hypnospace Outlaw is getting a sequel. Well, a spiritual sequel called Dreamsettler. But it's almost exactly the same thing: a detective game set in an old version of the internet, which you'll trawl to uncover a mystery.
And there's more: another new game called Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer. It's more of an accompaniment or spin-off, and it's fictitiously made by Hypnospace Outlaw character Zane! Though developer Tendershoot and publisher No More Robots are so committed to this fiction they'll even apparently roleplay as Zane when answering questions on Steam forums and so on.
The Slayer X game is like retro Doom, or Duke Nukem 3D - a game in that vein. It's pixelated and filled with trashy gore and ridiculous weaponry. And if you know the story of Hypnospace Outlaw, you'll know Zane is out for revenge. He apparently found an old CD-ROM with the game on and decided to brush it up for a noughties audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Games has outlined its April and May content plan for Lost Ark, including two new playable classes.


Coming in April is the Glaivier, a new female martial artist advanced class who weaves together attacks with a spear and glaive depending on the two stances she uses: Focus and Flurry.


"“"While certain builds may focus your attention onto one of these weapons, an effective Glaivier can maximize their potential by creating balance between the two stances, building up energy in one stance which grants an impactful stat-boost when swapping to the other,"”" reads the blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has unveiled Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Mobile, an upcoming free-to-play tactical first-person shooter mobile game from the Rainbow Six franchise.
In this new game, players will be pitted against each other in 5v5 matches, or "Attack vs Defence". As the name suggests, attackers will have to gain intel on their enemy by deploying drones and breaching "walls, floors and ceilings". Meanwhile, those on the defence team will have to ensure their intel is secure with the use of spy cameras and traps.
You can check out Rainbow Six Mobile's reveal trailer below.

The latest entry in the teen-with-special-powers narrative adventure series first launched last summer, and was warmly received. It's "a beautiful return to small-town mystery and young adult drama," I wrote in Eurogamer's Life is Strange: True Colors review.


True Colors is just one of Microsoft's latest list of titles headed to Xbox Game Pass through the first half of April. Also on the cards are sports games Cricket 22 and MLB The Show 22, plus gothic fairytale Lost in Random and cybernoir point-and-click adventure Chinatown Detective Agency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following confusion over the project's future, the director of upcoming PS5 game Abandoned has spoken out about why developer Blue Box deleted various tweets about the game, the status of the game's prologue and his own "heartbreak" about the situation now surrounding the game's release.
Speaking to IGN, Hasan Kahraman of Blue Box Game Studios said the developer had removed older tweets about the game in a bid to keep information surrounding Abandoned up to date. "Basically, the tweets were deleted because some of the concept has changed, and I figured maybe just deleting the tweet and then tweeting more relevant information would be a better idea - which was actually not a good idea," Kahraman said.
"I have learned now just to keep them. Even if the information or concept changed, just keep the older information because people eventually will see for themselves what the difference is and then see what's more actual."

Last week, the embattled World of Warcraft and Call of Duty maker announced it would no longer require office-based staff to have had Covid jabs, while encouraging a gradual return to in-person working over the coming months.


The decision, announced in an email by Activision Blizzard exec Brian Bulatao, was immediately criticised by staff who said it risked employees who may be immunocompromised or who lived with others who are, and was poorly timed as the US faces up to Covid's current Omicron BA2 subvariant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper, the really promising new game by In Other Waters developer Jump Over the Age, will be released 5th May.

Excitingly, it'll be available day-one on Xbox Game Pass, on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. It'll also be available on PC from a number of stores (Steam, GOG, Epic, Humble), and - this just in - Nintendo Switch. There's no PlayStation version, sadly.

I played a demo of Citizen Sleeper recently and was impressed. It's a mash-up of a board game and an RPG. There's a lot of descriptive text and dialogue choices, as you'd get in an RPG, and there's levelling up and skills and that kind of thing. But it all plays out in a turn-based, board game kind of way, and quite a lot of what you can do depends on dice you roll at the beginning of each turn. It takes a bit of getting used to.

Ubisoft has not trumpeted the arrival of the new eight-player offering, dubbed Countdown, and it's easy to see why. The new mode has launched while the very real fight for control of Chernobyl power station has been in the headlines, during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 


Of course, the mode has been in development for some time - and was not created in response to the real-world crisis. The timing, however, is unforunate.

An offer was previously available to purchase a year’s subscription to streaming service PS Now for $59.99 (on the US PSN). This was a particularly good deal as existing PS Now subscribers will automatically transfer to the Premium tier of the new PS Plus worth $119.99 a year.


However, PS Now can currently only be purchased on a monthly basis (£8.99). Once the new PS Plus launches, PS Now will no longer be available as a standalone product so players will move to the equivalent tier at £13.49 monthly.
