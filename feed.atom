On Xbox Series X, it will run at 4K resolution. On Xbox Series S, it will run at 1440p. 


Speaking to IGN, Howard said Starfield sometimes ran at 60fps in development on console, but that Bethesda had taken the decision to lock its framerate because "we prefer the consistency".


"I think it'll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for," Howard said. "Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen."

In a post-event roundtable in Los Angeles attended by Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell, Booty said that Microsoft's output was entering a new era.


"We had some gaps last year, but I think we've turned the corner coming into 2023," Booty said. "[I] feel very good about launching Hi-Fi Rush, we have Minecraft Legends out there which is doing well, we have Age of Empires continuing to come to console... and then as we saw today, this fall we have Forza Motorsport and Starfield."

Things are a little bit different this time around, with Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector introducing a brand-new - and steadily declining - Sleeper android protagonist, alongside a new setting where players will need to build themselves a life among the starts.


This particular Sleeper has been hiding out in the Starward Belt at the edge of the Helion System, and, having rewritten their own code in an effort to escape servitude, is now on the run with a malfunctioning body, a bounty on their head, and no memory of their past.

There were the steampunk machines, the gleaming statues and overhead skyrails, the alternate history Americana. The first-person visuals and chunky golden guns didn't help things either. 


But no, this is the completely legally distinct Clockwork Revolution, from Wasteland 3 developer InXile Entertainment, and this "vibrant steam-powered metropolis" is named Avalon.

Publisher Paradox Interactive officially unveiled the sequel back in March, calling it a "revolutionary" spin on the acclaimed 2015 original and the "most open-ended city-building sandbox on the planet". Other than talk of a "fully-realised transport and economy systems", however, specifics remained pretty thin.


Courtesy of tonight's Xbox Games Showcase, though, we've now had our first proper look at Cities: Skylines 2 in action, with Colossal Order showing off a sequel that notably ramps up the realism, in terms of visuals at least.

Anyway, continuing this theme, Life is Strange developer Don't Nod's new Jusant looks absolutely stellar.


It's a sci-fi climbing game, by the looks of it, in which a young hero climbs endless mountain walls with a funny little creature for company. There looks to be puzzling, interaction with mountain communities, a range of surfaces to climb on, and a sprinkling of futuristic stuff. And at one point you ride a mushroom.


The sense of place - and the lighting, cor - is just wonderful. And the game's due out in 2023. Cannot wait for this one.

The video announced that after Appalachia had welcomed 15 million dwellers, Atlantic City beckons. New Jersey's pleasure city was invoked with a lot of gambling imagery and a neat riff on one of Springsteen's greatest songs, which I enjoyed at least.


Not much else to say at the moment, but the game is "coming soon". If you get a chance, do dust off Nebraska, which is one of the Boss' finest.

Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is slated for an early 2024 release on Xbox and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years of furiously willing it into existence has paid off! Monkey Island is finally FINALLY coming to Sea of Thieves in a major story crossover starting on 20th July this year.


It's not a complete surprise, of course; Rare first teased a Monkey Island crossover for Sea of Thieves back in 2021, tucked in a tiny corner of the game's Pirates of the Caribbean adventure. And now self-proclaimed mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood and friends will be getting similar treatment across three brand-new Tall Tales.


Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island - as the crossover is officially known - begins on Mêlée Island, where Threepwood is inexplicably receiving adulation from his peers. What follows is a "love-letter to the classic adventure game" that'll feature a host of familiar faces, including Murray, LeChuck, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator has been a huge success for Xbox - and it's a success that developer Asobo is seemingly capitalising on with the feature-saturated Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.


It's like Asobo sat down and brainstormed every use for a plane that's not just flying from A to B, and worked to put it in Microsoft Flight Sim. The list is frankly astonishing, and includes:


Aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, air ambulance, crop dusting, mountain rescue, skydive aviation, aerial construction, cargo transport, VIP charter service, air racing, glider pilot, scientific research, low altitude training, experimental trips, executive transport service, airship tours and hot air balloon trips. Phew.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Xbox's 2023 showcase today we just got out first glimpse of Thunder Lotus' new game. The developer behind Spiritfarer and Sundered has been working on 33 Immortals, a top-down action-RPG roguelite with a delicate hand-painted art style and co-op for 33 players. What?!


It looks like a fascinating piece of work, with a delicate, rather serious tone, sonorous choral music, and delicate animation. But also: 33 players in an action-RPG! Based on a bit of gameplay, 33 Immortals won't scrimp when it comes to throwing loads of enemies your way, and there was a lovely bullet hell element to some of the spells going off.


33 Immortals will be released in 2024 for Xbox X/S, and will appear day one on Game Pass.

A CGI trailer showed a bounty hunter-stuffed trailer starring a smuggler character named Kay. What we saw offered just a glimpse, but it was very, very Star Wars.


Cue scenes with Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters, people frozen in carbonite, and at least one Hutt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Talking to Eurogamer at Summer Games Fest today, Sonic Team vice president of product development Takashi Iizuka has clarified the question of the newly unveiled Sonic Superstars' main developer: it's being led by Arzest, the Japanese studio which recently co-developed Fantasian and the troubled Balan Wonderworld - and that's headed up by Sonic's original creator Naoto Ohshima.
"This is a brand new classic Sonic Game that's been developed," Iizuka-san said, via translator, "and in order to recreate that classic Sonic gameplay, we needed someone who understands the classic Sonic series and understands that gameplay format, in order to really execute well on the final product."
"And so we're working together, with Naoto Ohshima-san, who is the creator of Sonic the Hedgehog and was there at Sonic 1, creating and developing the game. We're working with Ooshima-san and his team at Arzest, they're leading development on the title and they're doing a great job of making a brand new classic Sonic game."

Where have Wallace and Gromit got to? Judging by the purple ringed planet in the sky and the sci-fi mountains nearby, this isn't anywhere nearby. Let's take a look:

Exactly how soon, however, seems to depend on the ongoing writer's strike which has shutdown much of Hollywood.


"We're in the midst of this writers' strike, and so everything has been paused and on hold for the right reasons," Pratt told Entertainment Tonight.

The game's official website confirms there will be a disc-based version in Asia - though only for PlayStation consoles, allowing PS4 copies to be played on PS5 consoles with disc drives. For the game's PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S formats, "no physical edition will be released". 


Outside of Asia, the situation is less clear. Local versions of the official website for the UK and USA omit any mention of a physical release, and simply point to digital storefronts for the game on all formats - PC, PlayStation and Xbox.

Now, Ubisoft has revealed a further option that nods all the way back to Assassin's Creed 1 (which, I'm slightly alarmed to acknowledge, is now nearing its 16th birthday).


Where Mirage's colour palette is all golden sunrays and splashes of crimson, the original AC1 had a much bluer filter. To me, it pointed to the fact your historical adventures were all just a simulation - similar to the green palette employed in The Matrix films.

The bug, which Niantic previously told Eurogamer was an "unfortunate technical error", was eventually fixed by the developer only after fans worked to crowdsource data and diagnose the problem for themselves.


It was the latest in a string of issues which seem to regularly affect the hugely-successful mobile app, with the  release of Pokémon and the launch of in-game events frequently marred by some problem or other - particularly in early timezones such as New Zealand and Australia, where it is now a running joke in the game's community that players act as unofficial beta testers.

Like its enormously enjoyable predecessor, Blasphemous 2 is part Metroidvania, part Souls-like, marrying a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling imagery.


Blasphemous 2 sees the return of pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One in an adventure set across a unfamiliar land - a labyrinthine new kingdom promising a "series of enchantingly grotesque landscapes", and ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Overkill Software's perenially popular co-operative heist-'em-up Payday 2 is currently free to download and keep on the Epic Games Store.


Released all the way back in 2013, Payday 2 sees teams of up to four players turning to a life of crime, embarking on a career of increasingly outlandish heists across Washington DC.


Payday 2's development officially ceased at the end of 2018, amid financial difficulties for Overkill's parent company Starbreeze, but the game recieved a surprise resurrection the following year, and updates of various sizes have continued to release since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to last night's Summer Game Fest opening livestream, which offered us a first look at new Sonic and Prince of Persia games, plus a mouth-watering glimpse at Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth.

What didn't we see? A little oddly, Square Enix decided not to showcase Final Fantasy 16 - the one which actually goes on sale in a couple of weeks. Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty was also missing, as was host Geoff Keighley's best pal Hideo Kojima. Once the conference concluded, discussion online focused on the lack of any women on stage, following appearances by a string of male developers - and also Nic Cage.
On the upside, no one unexpectedly walked on stage and got arrested. So, how do we feel about all that, and how would we rate the conference overall? Was it a satisfying alternative to E3? Or are we hoping for more now from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom over the coming days? Joining me to discuss all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

Nate, you see, is unemployed and lives with his parents, spending his time nestled in front of the television until he's sucked into a fantasy world inside the screen.

But those that stuck around post-Keighley were, as is fast becoming tradition, rewarded with another batch of intriguing indie titles, courtesy of this year's Day of the Devs stream - and if you missed it, the whole thing can be perused in one convenient, easily digestible round-up below.

Beastieball

Beastieball is a new RPG from Wishes Unlimited, the studio behind the acclaimed Wondersong and Chicory. This time around, the team is turning its attention to what looks something like Pokémon with its combat replaced by a strategic, turn-based take on volleyball. It sees players, in the role of a coach, touring the world and signing up Beasties they encounter to join their team and take on rivals in bouts of Beastieball. Loads of Beasties are promised, and they can all form friendships that'll create unique combos for use in matches. This one might still be a little way off, though - a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign launches soon.

If you missed Shadows of the Damned at the time, it's a slightly silly demon shooter written by Goichi "Suda51" Suda, back from around the same time as Lollipop Chainsaw (a remaster of which was previously confirmed for launch this year).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the hubbub of the Summer Geoffs, Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have given a fresh look at Warhammer: Space Marine 2, showing of a slice of co-op campaign gameplay ahead of its arrival this "winter".


Announced during last year's The Game Awards, Space Marine 2 expands on the third-person shoot-and-slash template of the Relic Entertainment developed original, which released all the way back in 2011. It sees the return of the first game's protagonist, Captain Titus (albeit with a new voice actor), and a new threat in the form of the Tyranids.


One of Space Marine 2's big new features, not previously revealed, is the ability to play its main campaign either solo or in three-player co-op mode either with two friends of AI. And we've not been given a glimpse of that courtesy of its newly revealed Summer Game Fest trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horror movie legend John Carpenter is teaming up with Saber Interactive for Toxic Commando, a co-op FPS promising '80's vibes, action, humour, and horror' when it launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime next year.


Toxic Commando's action unfolds somewhere in the "near future", in a world where a failed experiment to harness the power of the Earth's core has unleashed an Eldritch abomination known as the Sludge God, intent on "turning soil to scum and the living to undead monsters".


Enter the Toxic Commandos, or, more specifically, up to four players, who'll each need to select a class to suit their playstyle. From there, it's a case of grabbing a weapon (firearms, grenades, even a katana), then tackling the mutant hordes on-foot or from behind the wheel of a vehicle.

Will Arnett, who is voicing Sweet Tooth in this adaptation, introduced the new trailer, which sees Anthony Mackie squaring off with the series' clown-faced killer in an arcade. Actually, maybe those are slot machines. 


It's all pretty awkward, if I am honest. Sweet Tooth pushes Mackie's John Doe up against a cabinet and makes him sing along with him as the two share back and forth quips. But, it is what it is, as you can see for yourself below.

The trailer is typically charming. The centre of the island has collapsed revealing a jungle. A bunch of heroes investigate an ancient temple, Fishstick does the Lara Croft emote roll, there are vines that are also grind rails and rideable velociraptor mounts. It's basically everything you could want.


Then Optimus Prime turns up, things go wrong, and at the very end the big reveal is... Slone is back! SLONE IS BACK!

Brode described Conquest mode as "a great way to get a super competitive experience". The mode was announced recently, and seems to hinge on competing against the same opponent multiple times, draining their health with each win. It won't replace the standard game mode, but will provide another option.


Marvel Snap's a brilliant collectible card game for smartphones and PC. It's got some genuinely brilliant cards in it and loads of fascinating design ideas. Do check it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Games Fest is underway and Bandai Namco has just revealed a new third-person action game from Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball. It's called Sand Land, and its based on Toriyama's manga from 2000.


Sand Land's set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply. When lawlessness breaks out over rising water costs, a sheriff approaches some local demons to strike a bargain.


What this means from the game's reveal is an action game set in what looks like a large open world. Players explore in everything from hoverbikes to tanks and even on the backs of dinosaurs. There's elaborate futuristic weaponry and fast third-person combat. It's enlivened by lovely comic visual design and an art style that recalls things like Borderlands, with visible pen lines on characters and the landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest has kicked off. Literally. 


Along with the newly announced Prince of Persia game, we were swiftly treated to a look at Mortal Kombat 1. This included gameplay, so expect plenty of blood and gore. I am talking about decapitations, saws to the face, spinal cord removal. You know, kind of what you'd expect from the famously brutal fighter series. 


Here is that trailer. Maybe put any food you were eating to one side before diving in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gun Interactive has announced an end for Friday the 13th: The Game, confirming the asymmetrical multiplayer horror will be pulled from stores on 31st December this year, the same day its Friday the 13th licence officially expires.


Friday the 13th: The Game has been around since 2017, and, despite a rocky start, proved to be a solidly entertaining - and commercially successful - horror experience. Unfortunately, its development was forced to end prematurely in 2018 amid a lawsuit relating to the ownership of the Friday the 13th licence, and 2020 bought the news Gun would be decommissioning the game's dedicated servers, reverting to the peer-to-peer networking favoured at launch.


Since then, with no new content in development, Friday the 13th: The Game has largely remained out of the spotlight, but, now, Gun has confirmed - in a statement shared on Twitter - the game'll no longer be available to purchase, either digitally or physically, once its licence expires on 31st December 2023. There's some small solace for owners, however, in that the developer says the game will remain playable through "at least" 31st December 2024.

It begins at 8pm UK time (9pm CEST / 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT) and you can watch the stream here while we report live on what we see. I'm sure you know the drill by now, but this is a chance for us to follow the announcements together and talk about whether we're impressed by them. Will we be?
What is on the cards for tonight, then - what should we expect? Well, Geoff Keighley, obviously, because it's his show. But in terms of head-turning games: Ed Boon will be there to show Mortal Kombat 1, the franchise reboot, and Remedy's Sam Lake will be there to show more of Alan Wake 2.

In a minute-long video, Goldberg explained how excited she was to play Diablo 4, which she called her "favourite game" series, on her Apple computer, which she called her "favourite gaming system". 

"I know there's a lot of terrible things happening in the world, but what I'm about to tell you is not on any scale like that," Goldberg said. Indeed, it's not quite as grim as seeing Diablo 4's billboard advert against the backdrop of wildfires, or Activision Blizzard CCO Lulu Cheng Meservey assuring us the company has "no affiliation or partnership" with said natural disaster. But you know what they say - an Apple a day keeps the demons away. Or something like that.

Gaiden was first announced in September last year, when it was described as a more compact return to the action gameplay of previous games in the series. Plot-wise, the game will follow series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and explain what happened to him in the gap between Yakuza 6 and Like a Dragon 8.

Back in September, Gaiden was teased with a release date at some point this year. Now, it seems the game will launch in November, according to data scraped by website PS Deals (thanks, Gematsu).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Kojima Productions have released a new trailer for their Hideo Kojima documentary, which is said to promise a "creative journey into the mind of a video games icon".  


Known as Connecting Worlds, this documentary will provide us with a "rare insight" into Kojima's creative process, with the likes of Norman Reedus - currently working with Kojima on Death Stranding's sequel DS2 - and filmmaker Guillermo del Toro contributing to the upcoming production.


In a short trailer, which you can see below, Reedus likens working with Kojima to "stepping into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory with Willy Wonka".  Meanwhile, on screen text proclaims Kojima as being "widely regarded as the first auteur of video games". From what I can tell, this documentary will cover Kojima's experience founding Kojima Productions as well as his creative process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the summer heat is getting to you, here is something that will cool you down a bit - Lake, the cosy postal game, is getting a wintery and festive DLC.


Appropriately titled Season's Greetings, this DLC will act as a prequel taking place nine months before the main story of Lake. This time, players will take on the role of Thomas Weiss, father of Lake's protagonist Meredith Weiss, as he goes about his days delivering mail to the residents of Providence Oaks, while readying himself for a visit from his daughter. 


Lake developer Gamious promises more of the same cosy and relaxing gameplay in Season's Greetings, with the addition of new characters as well as some familiar faces. There will also be the chance to find answers to some of those lingering questions players still have from the main game - though the developer stopped short of spoiling any specifics. You can see a short trailer for Season's Greetings below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Horror, the Junji-Ito-inspired roguelike RPG from developer Paweł Koźmiński, leaves PC early access on 19th October and releases for PlayStation and Switch on the same day.


World of Horror initially launched into PC early access a little over three years ago, and its deliciously nasty tale of a seaside town beseiged by malevolent cosmic forces - which players must investigate over the course of five randomly selected mysteries each playthrough - has slowly expanded with new stories, events, and features since then.


If you've not yet hopped onboard World of Horror's early access, the whole thing plays out something like a 1-bit version of the board game Arkham Horror, albeit with Lovecraftian overtones traded for something closer to Junji Ito's distinct brand of the mundane run amok - so think high school terror, haunted bulletin board systems, and so on.

As its name suggests, Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine turns the spotlight on Super meat Boy villain Dr. Fetus who, this time around, is aiming to create the perfect clone of Meat Boy - a process requiring him to eliminate all the rubbish clones first.


And so enter the Mean Meat Machine, a terrifying contraption that sees malformed clones dropping in at the top and then falling en masse to the bottom, wending their way past an array of deadly devices as they go, including chainsaws, missiles, and lasers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ThroughLine Games, the studio behind the acclaimed Forgotton Anne, has unveiled Forgotlings, an equally gorgeous "spiritual sequel" that's just launched a Kickstarter campaign.


Forgotlings, like its predecessor, takes place in a "magical realm inhabited by things we have lost and forgotten", where sentient creatures - the Forgotlings - live in search of a purpose.


However, despite its shared universe, Forgotlings looks to be something of a new beginning in both story and gameplay terms. It casts players as Fig, a "gifted posing doll", thrust into a world caught in a conflict between five mighty tribes. Fig will need to unite each tribe to save the world from destruction at the hands of an "enigmatic Beast".

Dimension Shellshock promises to bring fans an "all-new adventure" introducing the Ninja Turtles' occasional ally Miyamoto Usagi, who originally made the jump from his own Usagi Yojimbo comicbook series into the turtles' world back in 1987.


Alongside its new playable character (the announcement trailer teases new playable "characters" but doesn't elaborate further), Dimension Shellshock also includes a mysterious new game mode, alternative colour palette options, plus new music composed by Tee Lopes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first major Counter-Strike 2 update has arrived since the game launched as a limited test in March, bringing with it a radical new loadout system, new buy mechanics and - finally! - a new map for testing purposes, Mirage. 
The loadout system has the potential to be the most disruptive change, as you can now choose five each of pistols, rifles and "mid-tier" (SMG/shotgun) weapons to take into a match. Previously, weapons like the silenced and unsilenced M4 were assigned to the same category, so you would have to go without one of them - but here, you could sacrifice one of the less-used rifles to have both options available. This change has been requested by players for a long time, and would also make it easier for developers Valve to add new weapons in the future, so it's a big win in my book. 
When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first appeared more than a decade ago, it sported a radial buy menu designed to mesh nicely to gamepad controls - after all, the game was originally intended to buy a console-focused iteration of the franchise. That menu has been replaced in the new Counter-Strike 2 update, in favour of a simpler grid-based buy menu that shows your teammate's purchases. Crucially, it's now possible to refund unused weapons, armour and grenades before buy time expires at the start of each round, saving you from the ignoble fate of spending all your hard-earned cash on a weapon you bought accidentally - always a pain given the importance of Counter-Strike's round-to-round economy system.

In an blog update today, the publisher acknowledged it had been a while since many pre-orders had been placed. Three years later, Bloodlines 2 still does not have a release date.


Paradox said it was still "dedicated to delivering" a great game, but that it was now updating its various editions and bonus content. "With the bonus content being updated, the prior physical edition offered items that are no longer representative of the game," it explained. As such, the publisher said it was offering refunds in order to "provide the best value".

While elder dragon Amatsu was originally supposed to bring Sunbreak's story to a close in April's Ver. 15 update, Capcom says it decided to squeeze one last surprise in for players after it identified a few additional features it wanted to include.


As such, Sunbreak owners will face a final, formidable challenge when tomorrow's free Title Update 6 (AKA Ver. 16) arrives, bringing the expansion's story to a close with a battle against the Primordial Malzeno, revealing more on its relationship with the Kingdom. The fight - which features new moves compared to the original version of Malzeno - will be available to hunters at Master Rank 10 and above, and includes materials needed to craft new weapons and armour.

As a quick reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release on PC back in March. However, in a bizarre series of events, it transpired that Fntastic had failed to trademark the game's name, which had since been contested by the company behind a calendar app. All traces of the game were subsequently removed from Steam.


Talking to WellPlayed, Fntastic has now provided a small update on this trademark debacle, stating it believes "power is in the truth".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a week after its leap onto Mac, No Man's Sky is back with another update, this one ushering in a new limited-time expedition focusing on AI corruption and robotic uprisings - and promising hints at future updates and "a deeper story to come".


Expeditions, for those unfamiliar with No Man's Sky's ways, are something like Hello Games' stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges with some nifty rewards.


Its latest expedition, Singularity, which launches today, continues the story started in April's Interceptor update (the one with weird, corrupted worlds and strange Sentinel oddities), asking players to investigate curious robot heads delivering cryptic clues across the galaxy. Its events are said to be part of a longer narrative that'll play out as the year goes on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 looks set to arrive on 21st September, according to a new launch date which has leaked online. 


The release date for Starbreeze's heist shooter sequel was spotted by Aggiornamenti Lumia, a Twitter account which regularly surfaces listings on the Microsoft Store before they are publicly visible. 


It's interesting timing for a Payday 3 launch date to appear - just a day before Summer Games Fest 2023 kicks off in earnest with an announcement-filled livestream. Other events from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom are also set to follow in the coming days.

This may seem obvious - after all, our own planet is of course a sphere (sorry Flat Earthers) - but when so many games present a flat map, it's easy to misinterpret.


Harrison Pink, senior quest designer on the game, shared this "tiny lore nugget" on Twitter.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Incident Response (IR) allows victim firms to detect, contain, and recover from security incidents. It should also help the wider community avoid similar attacks in the future. In pursuit of these goals, technical practitioners are increasingly influenced by stakeholders like cyber insurers and lawyers. This paper explores these impacts via a multi-stage, mixed methods research design that involved 69 expert interviews, data on commercial relationships, and an online validation workshop. The first stage of our study established 11 stylized facts that describe how cyber insurance sends work to a small numbers of IR firms, drives down the fee paid, and appoints lawyers to direct technical investigators. The second stage showed that lawyers when directing incident response often: introduce legalistic contractual and communication steps that slow-down incident response; advise IR practitioners not to write down remediation steps or to produce formal reports; and restrict access to any documents produced...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Angry Birds: Mystery Island will follow the escapades of three new hatchlings - Mia, Rosie, and Buddy. There is also a new foreign-exchange piglet, and his name is the rather brilliant Hamylton. 


According to a press release, these four "rambunctious tweens" receive an all expenses paid island getaway, but of course things are not going to go to plan. Rather than landing where they intended, they instead get unceremoniously catapulted onto an "uncharted island" (where I assume they will meet Nathan Drake).

Niantic will now return any Remote Raid Pass used on these bosses, and hold an additional "special event" to make up for the error.
Remote Raid Passes were recently nerfed by Niantic to make them less attractive for players to use, with a limit on the number of times they can be used per day and a more expensive price tag. The discovery that Remote Raid Passes were giving lower-than-expected Shiny odds left fans wondering whether this was yet another change by Niantic.

News of EA's plans were first reported by IGN, who claimed the publisher was currently considering shifting The Old Republic's development to Broadsword Online Games, a company run by former BioWare vice president and Mythic Entertainment co-founder Rob Denton, who previously worked on the Star Wars title in its early days.


Broadsword is no stranger to MMOs, of course - its other projects include ongoing work on Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot - and IGN reported EA had already signed a letter of intent with the studio, which would see The Old Republic deal finalised "as soon as this month".

The big news this time around is that the Forgotten Lands' mysterious pumpkin house, which has sat vacant amid gloomy woods since launch, will finally have an occupant as part of what Gameloft is calling Dreamlight Valley's "biggest story update yet".


To the surprise of no-one with at least a passing interest in Disney, its new occupant will be Cinderella's Fairy Godmother - who comes complete with her own set of Friendship Quests - with her arrival seemingly signalling a conclusion for Dreamlight Valley's first major story arc.

Planet Zoo's Arid Animal Pack marks the game's 15th DLC expansion since its launch at the end of 2019, and - as with all Animal Packs - is predominantly focused on expanding the game's wildlife roster, this time with eight new creature additions.


Purchasers get access to the single-humped dromedary camel, the African crested porcupine, the black rhino, the addax (today I learned what an addax is!), the Somali wild ass, the sand cat, the dama gazelle, and the desert horned viper, which appears as an exhibit animal.

Career Rank is described as a "larger progression system" that reflects players' time across the entirety of Halo Infinite's multiplayer modes, and is said to be similar to the progression systems found in Halo: Reach and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.


According to 343, Career Rank is tied to a player's Personal Score, meaning that while all multiplayer matches will help players rank up, better match performance means faster progress through its various tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Onyx.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard seems pretty chuffed with the response to Diablo 4, and is now trumpeting the fact that, not only have players cumulatively already racked up over 10,000 years of play time, Diablo 4 is also the company's "fastest-selling game of all time".


Blizzard is calculating those impressive-sounding play time figures based on the number of in-game hours players have accrued since 1st June, the date when Diablo 4 entered "early access" for those willing to pay extra for the privilege.


The company reckons over 93m hours of Diablo 4 have been played across the first four days, equating to over 10,000 years (actually more like 10,616 hours according to my calculator, but who am I to quibble maths?) - or, as Blizzard puts it, the equivalent of one person "playing 24 hours a day since the beginning of human civilisation".

Word that Epic might be preparing to bring a jungle biome to the latest iteration of Fortnite's map first came via leakers back in April. And a couple of recent official social media asset updates - including some art of a city bordered by vines - lent further credence to those reports.


But now, thanks to a new 8-second teaser shared on the official Fortnite Twitter feed, a jungle biome is a good as confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of rumour and speculation, Apple has unveiled its long-in-the-works augmented reality headset, Vision Pro, which is due to release "early next year" for $3,499 USD.


Vision Pro - which Apple is insisting on referring to as a "spatial computer" - is designed around the idea of staying "present and connected to others", whether at home or at work. Which, in more practical terms, means its entire 3D interface is built around experiencing apps and other media directly within a user's immediate environment, as viewed through its internal display.


Apps can been relocated and resized in the physical space using Apple's new VisionOS 3D interface, which is primarily controlled through a mix of voice commands, eye tracking, and hand tracking - although traditional keyboards and trackpads are compatible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extensive gameplay of Ubisoft's open-world racer The Crew Motorfest has appeared online just a week ahead of its planned appearance at the publisher's Ubisoft Forward showcase.


Ubisoft unveiled The Crew Motorfest for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC back in January with a 49-second trailer featuring a handful of "in-engine" cinematics. It's a live-service game themed around a "one-of-a-kind" motoring festival, promising "tailor-made races, themed events, and other unique challenges", all taking place on the scenic Hawaiian island of O'ahu.


Since that official announcement, Ubisoft has hosted several "insider programme" closed testing sessions for registered players, with the fourth phase currently underway. It's this latest closed test that appears to have generated the spate of new gameplay videos Ubisoft is currently playing copyright-strike whack-a-mole with online.

Well, you don't have to wonder any longer, thanks to a group of modders creating a Resident Evil 0 demake. The game was originally released in 2002 for the GameCube, and looks and plays similar to the HD Resident Evil remaster.

This demake for 0 does the opposite, however, and turns the game into a Resident Evil experience like that of the first three games on PlayStation 1. Footage of the project in action can be seen below, via El Rincon del Lobezno's YouTube channel, who is one of the modders involved in its creation.

Beginning at the end of last week, Square Enix has issued fresh comments on the game each day - thankfully remembering the project still exists, after nearly a year of no news.



The first comment confirmed a release date was being considered, while subsequent comments have noted that the game will have a "multifaceted world with a high degree of freedom" - which some fans are interpreting to mean "open world". Lastly, Square Enix has  clarified that yes, this game will in fact contain a story and characters. Who'd have thought?

However, I - and other fans - think we may have sussed it. Please note, there are some minor Tears of the Kingdom spoilers below.

Phantom Blade Zero was officially announced a couple of weeks ago at Sony's PlayStation Showcase, where it gained attention for its slick wuxia-influenced combat and Souls-esque vibes.

The plot follows Soul, an elite assassin for an organisation known as The Order, as he attempts to track the person who framed him for killing the The Order's patriarch on limited time. S-Game made the comments on what players can expect in its Discord server through a series of developer Q&As.

<blockquote><p>For decades, features have accumulated like cruft in new vehicles: a box here to control the antilock brakes, a module there to run the cruise control radar, and so on. Now engineers and designers are rationalizing the way they go about building new models, taking advantage of much more powerful hardware to consolidate all those discrete functions into a small number of domain controllers.</p>
<p>The behavior of new cars is increasingly defined by software, too. This is merely the progression of a trend that began at the end of the 1970s with the introduction of the first electronic engine control units; today, code controls a car&#8217;s engine and transmission (or its electric motors and battery pack), the steering, brakes, suspension, interior and exterior lighting, and more, depending on how new (and how expensive) it is. And those systems are being leveraged for convenience or safety features like adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, remote parking, and so on...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Fabrics can be taken to the dye shop in Hateno Village, where you can customise your glider with different designs. While some fabrics can be gained by completing side quests, others are (annoyingly) locked behind scanning Amiibo.

Sony will study "various options" around streaming games, even using its AI agent GT Sophy to enhance cloud gaming, said Yoshida in an interview with the Financial Times.


"I think cloud itself is an amazing business model, but when it comes to games, the technical difficulties are high," said Yoshida. "So there will be challenges to cloud gaming, but we want to take on those challenges."

Sony was criticised by some fans for using CG footage in its recent PlayStation Showcase. That event also included a trailer for Sony's upcoming Gran Turismo movie.

Ascension was one of the more mysterious projects announced alongside the news that Bloober Team was remaking Silent Hill 2, and there's not been much else said about it since, despite the release date originally pointing to early 2023.

Now, however, we've got an "official trailer" – which is more than we had last time – and confirmation that it's still on track to release at some point later this year.

According to a new Bloomberg (£) and spotted by VGC, Microsoft president Brad Smith plans to meet UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to discuss firsthand the company's frustration at the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) decision to block the $69bn acquisition.

Though in the UK for a talk about regulating AI, Smith also hopes to hold private discussions with the Chancellor, including, according to a spokesperson, "the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard as we remain committed to finding creative and constructive ways to address remaining regulatory concerns".

Casual farming sim Homestead Arcana came to Xbox Game Pass in April, complete with the usual 30+ achievements that reward working your way through the game's story and various activities.

However, it didn't take long for players to realise that one of the achievements – called "You Can't Be Too Prepared" – was proving difficult to complete, as it requires players to craft every item in the game at least once.

The update comes a decade after the game first debuted back in 2013, and means you no longer bruise your thumb as you spam the run button, tearing through Los Santos.

As spotted by TheGamer, that's not the only quality-of-life improvement making its debut, either. Rather than claim all of your destroyed vehicles from Mors Mutal Insurance individually, you'll now find an option to get it all over with at once. You can also add custom description tags in your garages to "help quickly locate your favourite rides", and believe it or not, snow is also making its long-awaited debut in Creator.

Aspyr Media revealed on Friday that Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 – The Sith Lords' highly-anticipated DLC, Restored Content, would now not be coming to Nintendo Switch after all. The team did not explain why the DLC would "not be moving forward", and would not offer refunds either, instead choosing to offer a complimentary key for one of seven other Star Wars games.

As fans responded to the news, modder zbyl2 – who helped bring the Restored Content mod to PC in the first place – popped up in a comment on the KOTOR subreddit, saying: "Aspyr did nothing wrong. Quote me on that. Shame it ended the way it did".

In a brief statement, CEO Andrew Byatt insisted that the studio had commissioned an artist "to produce a lead image for the new Duke Nukem 1+2 Remastered" game, but "because of "the artists' use of AI in the process", it had "fallen below the expectation and standards demanded by fans". 

Fans and professional artists were immediately suspicious when the artwork was first revealed, with some providing a breakdown of why the image – reportedly designed by "professional hybrid concept artist" Oskar Manuel – looked as though it had been machine-generated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aspyr Media has revealed that Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 – The Sith Lords' highly-anticipated DLC, Restored Content, will now not be coming to Nintendo Switch after all.

Whilst the team confirmed that the DLC plans would "not be moving forward", it did not offer an explanation as to why the content – which started out as a fan-made mod to restore content to the original game – had been scrapped. 

After thanking the KOTOR community for its "immense passion and support for the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series", Aspyr said: "Sadly, today we are announcing that the Restored Content DLC for the Nintendo Switch version of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 – The Sith Lords will not be moving forward for release"."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Epic Games Store has booted Fallout: New Vegas up the bum and off its freebie list, making room for another free weekly title - which this time looks an awful lot like Midnight Ghost Hunt.


Midnight Ghost Hunt, from developer 
Vaulted Sky Games, is described as a "chaotic multiplayer hide-and-seek game" that casts one team of four as fearless Ghost Hunters and the other as naughty spirits intent on causing the former harm.


Ghost Hunters get the cool gadgets, as you might imagine, including a Spectrophone, Radar and Pathfinder for the spook detection bit, plus traps and vacuums to capture them, and a heap of more direct spectre-slaying tools, including sledgehammers, harpoons, and a cannon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 is off to a roaring start on Steam, having more than doubled the all-time record for concurrent players set by its nearest fighting game rival in less that 24 hours of release.


As flagged by Steam analyst Benji-Sales on Twitter, Street Fighter 6 has already secured a significant all-time concurrent peak on Valve's storefront, recorded at 66,317 players by SteamCharts at the time of writing. The figure is more than twice that of its nearest fighting competitor, Mortal Kombat 11, which currently enjoys an all-time peak of 27,301 players.


Street Fighter 6's concurrent peak is also leagues ahead of its direct predecessor, Street Fighter 5, which reached an all-time high of 13,807 players on Steam, and it's also managed to outshine the likes of Tekken 7, whose all-time peak sits at 18,766 players

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its Pride Month festivities, Microsoft has made developer Don't Nod's well-received queer mystery adventure Tell Me Why free to download and keep in its entirety on Xbox and PC, in what's becoming a bit of a Pride tradition.


Tell Me Why, if you're unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the Alaskan town of Delos Crossing.


Their troubled past begins to resurface, though, and the slick mystery thriller gains a distinctly supernatural tinge (this is very definitely a spiritual sibling to Don't Nod's Life is Strange 1 & 2), but Tell Me Why never loses sight of the beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists, even if it doesn't quite reach the memorable highs of its forebears.

Researchers and programmers immediately started modifying it, improving it, and getting it to do things no one else anticipated. And their results have been immediate, innovative, and an indication of how the future of this technology is going to play out.

In a statement issued via Twitter today, Rebirth producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed development is progressing smoothly and a firm release date is now being considered. So that's nice.


Square Enix has Rebirth listed for a "winter 2023" release. Up next from the publisher is the all-new Final Fantasy 16, which is released later this month.

The listing, shared on reddit, suggests the demo is on the PSN and ready to go, but has only been seen by those who have pre-ordered the game in advance and when browsing on mobile. I've seen no mention of a demo on the console PSN myself.


Square Enix stated a demo was on the way, but no release date was given. So when might it arrive?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've squeezed every last drop of spade-based fun from developer Vine and Yacht Club Games' Shovel Knight spin-off Pocket Dungeon, help is at hand! The extremely enjoyable adventure is poised to receive its "gigantic" free Puzzler's Pack DLC next Tuesday, 6th June.


Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon, if you're unfamiliar, sees the titular spade-wielding hero try his hand at block-falling puzzle-action. Across a procession of single-screen dungeons, players must dodge perpetually tumbling enemies and obstacles then smack chains of them into oblivion, keeping things clear long enough to eventually escape. It's a lot more nuanced than that, though, and clever enough that Eurogamer's Christian Donlan slapped its "lovely balance of precision and chaos" with a Recommended badge in 2022.

Anyway, the already surprisingly ample package is set to expand again on Tuesday, when Pocket Dungeon's Puzzler's Pack DLC arrives on PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile via Netflix. It adds Puzzle Knight and Mona as playable chracters - the first able to rotate surrounding foes clockwise to create new combos, the latter armed with alchemist abilities that can explode nearby potions - plus new battles, boons, bosses, feats, and a "ton" of relics.

GSC Game World - which relocated from Kyiv to Prague last year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine - first confirmed it was the target of Russian hackers back in March, when it revealed an employee's accounts was hacked and that the studio had been threatened with blackmail.


"We are a Ukrainian company," it wrote at the time, "and like most Ukrainians, we have experienced many things that are much more terrifying: destroyed houses, ruined lives, and the deaths of our loved ones. Attempts to blackmail or intimidate us are completely futile".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we teeter on the edge of Summer Game Fest and the Season of Big Announcements, Ubisoft is revving up for June's Ubisoft Forward showcase with a new trailer highlighting at least some of the games that'll feature - and one vague tease that may or may not be Star Wars.


Ubisoft Forward, which is being broadcast live from Los Angeles - as good an excuse as any to resurrect that old Just Dance dance number, if you ask me - takes place on Monday, 12th June, at 6pm BST/10am PDT. A pre-show of undisclosed content will begin a quarter of an hour earlier.


The main event will feature a closer look at the publisher's upcoming slate of releases, with Assassin's Creed Mirage, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and The Crew Motorfest all now confirmed for a showing. We'll probably also get at least some updates on Ubisoft's raft of other lingering titles, including its free-to-play games and the perpetually delayed Skull and Bones - but not, as we recently heard, the now-rebooted Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.

Meta describes the Meta Quest 3 - which will be fully compatible with the existing Meta Quest 2 library - as the "first mainstream headset with high-res colour mixed reality", and promises "better displays and resolution", greater comfort, a 40 percent slimmer optic profile, and twice the graphics performance using "next-gen Qualcomm chipset".


Its mixed reality feature set includes "dual 4MP RGB colour cameras, a depth sensor for a more accurate representation of your play space, and 10x more pixels in Passthrough compared to Quest 2". Additionally, Meta has "completely redesigned" Quest 3's Touch Plus controllers, dropping the outer tracking rings and adding "TruTouch haptics".

Kojima's comments come from a recently-translated interview with magazine Weekly Toyo Keizai (thanks Games Radar), in which he states the game required 300 revisions following 9/11, leaving his team in "crisis mode".



The end of the game has Arsenal Gear (a giant military fortress) crashing into Manhattan, but the final release shows only the before and after, with the rest left to the player's imagination.

These moments in the sequel's gameplay reveal were impressive, invoking memories of similar fluidity from Insomniac's fellow PS5 exclusive Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. But I still had questions. Can we only switch characters at certain story points or will we be able to switch between them freely? 


It turns out, the answer is a little bit of both.

No Man's Sky for Mac machines was announced just under a year ago during Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote, where it took centrestage as a bit of a poster child for the tech giant's new Metal 3 API. At the time, it was expected to release before the end of the year (as was a version for iPad) but that ultimately slipped into 2023.


And now, a year and one ambitious Switch release later, Hello Games has confirmed No Man's Sky arrives for Mac computers today, "built from the ground up with a new rendering pipeline to take full advantage of Metal and Apple silicon".

ZA/UM boss Ilmar Kompus made the statement in an interview with People Make Games, in which he was questioned on his buyout of shares in the company and whether or not Kompus illegally used company money to do so. The interview forms part of a longer documentary on the recent events surrounding Disco Elysium.


"The status of this sequel is something that has been jeopardised by this PR campaign as such, and the conflict as such," Kompus said, referring to the publicity ZA/UM has faced from former employees in the past couple of years. Although the lawsuit filed by former executive producer Kaur Kender was dropped, the company is still in the midst of another legal battle against writer Robert Kurvitz, who claims he was, along with Aleksander Rostov and Helen Hindpere, fired "under false premises".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red will lay off around 30 employees, as development on its card game spin-off Gwent winds down.


In a recent blog post, the developer reaffirmed its plan to place Gwent's future into the hands of its community. 


"The community has always been core to making the game what it is. That's why we had the confidence to move ahead with GWENTfinity in the first place: there isn't really anyone better to take charge of Gwent and see it move into a new era than you," CDPR wrote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firaxis Games - the developer behind the likes of XCOM, Civilization 6, and last year's Marvel's Midnight Suns - has laid off around 30 developers.


The layoffs occurred yesterday according to a report by Axios, with a representative for Firaxis publisher 2K Games telling the website the cuts were made due to a "sharpening of focus, enhancements of efficiencies, and an alignment of our talent against our highest priorities".


These latest job cuts mark the second round of layoffs at the publisher this year. Back in March, Take-Two confirmed it was cutting jobs at Private Division - the publishing label behind OlliOlli World and Kerbal Space Program - alongside other unspecified parts of the company.

Grassetti joined Santa Monica Studio in 2013, following stints at BioWare as a character artist and at PlayStation as an art supervisor on a number of first-party games, eventually moving to a principal artist role on 2018's God of War and, later, art director on its acclaimed sequel.


Grassetti confirmed his departure from Santa Monica Studio earlier this month, promising to reveal his next role soon. That day has now arrived, with Grassetti announcing he's joined Netflix Games to work on a new AAA title alongside Staten (who left Microsoft in April), former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny, and ex-Coalition technical director Jerry Edsall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed June's line-up of PlayStation Plus Essential titles, which this time around look an awful lot like Jurassic World Evolution 2, Trek to Yomi, and NBA 2K23.


Starting with Jurassic World Evolution 2 (PS4, PS5), it's the sequel to Frontier Development's decent if unremarkable 2018 theme park management sim, in which the genre's usual selection of rides and amusements are switched out in favour of rather more deadly attractions. It's a bit of an underwhelming follow-up, but it does offer a couple of improvements, including larger maps, more diverse biomes, and a new Chaos Theory mode revisiting key movie moments.


Trek to Yomi (PS4, PS5), meanwhile, comes from Shadow Warrior studio Flying Wild Hog, and takes players on an striking black-and-white adventure inspired by cinema's classic samurai tales. In more practical terms, it blends side-scrolling platforming with sword combat - a mixture that didn't quite grab Eurogamer's Robert Purchese when he took a look last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has stated the company has never had a "systemic issue with harassment" in a new interview with Variety.


His comments are in response to a lawsuit against the company by the State of California in 2021, claiming it had a "frat boy" culture. In the years since, a number of sexual harassment lawsuits have been filed and Kotick himself has been accused of turning a blind eye.


"We've had every possible form of investigation done. And we did not have a systemic issue with harassment - ever. We didn't have any of what were mischaracterisations reported in the media," Kotick told Variety. "But what we did have was a very aggressive labour movement working hard to try and destabilise the company."

The game has been controversial since its first announcement due to its focus on realistically depicting the battle of Fallujah, one of the bloodiest battles in the US-led invasion of Iraq.

A new post on the console's official Twitter account showed an Xbox controller covered in glitter. Curious.

First up is Grunge Revival Kit, which, as its name suggests, whisks players back to the 90s, for a clothing-focused pack themed around "the unpolished, the imperfect, and the free-spirited".


EA is yet to detail the DLC's exact contents, but expect "worn textures, layered options, and bold accessories", ranging from old band tees and baggie hoodies to faded jeans.

Mortal Kombat 1 finally got its proper unveiling in May, with NetherRealm confirming it to be a reboot of sorts set in a "reborn" universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang.


The full game is scheduled to release on 19th September but, before then, NetherRealm and publisher Warner Bros. are giving players a couple of opportunities to put a limited build through its paces; those who pre-order Mortal Kombat 1 can participate in a beta test happening in August, and there's also a newly announced "online stress test" on the way.

The CMA made the shock decision to block Microsoft proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard in April, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk "stifling competition in this growing market".


And now, following the recent publication of Microsoft's summary of application to appeal the CMA's decision - in which it accused the UK regulator of making "fundamental errors in its assessment" - the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal has held a case management conference to iron out preliminary details of the hearing between Microsoft and the CMA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog has shared an update on its long-in-the-works The Last of Us multiplayer title, saying it has "realised what is best for the game is to give it more time". It's also teased a new "brand-new single-player experience" currently in the works.


Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer project was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but the studio announced it was separating the two halves in 2019. Since then, updates on the multiplayer game have been sparse, with Naughty Dog popping up to confirm "we're working on it" in 2021 and then, last year, promising more would be revealed in 2023.


Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann reiterated the studio's intention to share more about the game "later this year" back in January, but a new statement from the developer suggests its plans for a more substantial reveal in 2023 may currently be on hold.

Roots of Pacha, which launched to an extremely positive reception back in April, was pulled from Valve's storefront by publisher Crytivo earlier this month - a move developer Soda Den claimed had occurred ""without [its] knowledge or consent".


"We worked hard to amicably resolve our issue with Crytivo internally," it said at the time. "Instead of working with us to address the issue, Crytivo went to Valve and authorised them to remove Roots of Pacha from Steam". Crytivo, meanwhile, claimed Soda Den had unexpectedly moved to "unilaterally rescind the contract we had worked under for three years".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as it said it would, Microsoft has appealed the CMA's decision to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and its summary of arguments is now available for scrutiny.


In April, after months of deliberation, the UK's Competition and Market Authority made the shock decision to block Microsoft proposed $69b acquisition of the Call of Duty maker, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk "stifling competition in this growing market".


It's a position that was welcomed by some and by rejected by others. The EU, which approved the deal in May after Microsoft agreed to concessions, has been critical of the CMA's stance, and a number of UK politicians, including chancellor Jeremy Hunt, have also raised concerns. Microsoft, of course, has also criticised the decision, confirming it would launch an appeal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment, the studio behind the recently released and critically lambasted The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, has reportedly received funding from the German government to develop a second Lord of the Rings title.


As spotted by German website Wirtschaft (thanks Gamesradar), Daedalic has been awarded a €2m grant - approximately £1.7m - by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs to work on what appears to be a second game in J. R. R. Tolkein's beloved fantasy universe.


The project, which is currently listed under the codename "It's magic" on the Ministry of Economic Affairs' website, is described (via Google Translate) as a game that will transport players to a "lush world full of mythical creatures and magic" and tell a "story from a character's perspective that has never been told before."

And in that spirit, developer Turn 10 has now revealed its latest Forza Motorsport game, bound for Xbox Series X/S and PC, will be getting two showings in June.


Forza Motorsport's first appearance will occur almost exactly a year after its official unveiling, during Microsoft's big Xbox Games Showcase for 2023, which kicks off on 11th June at 6pm BST. Here, Turn 10 will, as detailed on Twitter, be giving onlookers an "up-close look at the cars" they'll be a-whizzing in when launch day finally arrives.


Then, with that presumably comparatively swift segment out the way, Turn 10 will be going it alone with its own Forza Monthly showcase on 13th June. Here, it'll be serving up a "full walkthrough of [Forza Motorsports's] single-player career gameplay".

Lundgren, perhaps most famous for playing boxer Ivan Drago in Rocky 4, told Swedish publication Aftonbladet he's in South Africa shooting a spinoff series of The Witcher, which Collider speculates is the upcoming show about the Rats.


The Rats are a group of young Nilfgaardian thieves introduced in Andrzej Sapkowski's Time of Contempt
novel. The third season of The Witcher (the last starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia), adapts this book, and so the expectation is the Rats will be introduced to fans of the show before their spin-off hits the screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever looked at Mega Man's all blue aesthetic and thought, "yes, I like that ensemble, and I would absolutely wear it, but those boots just don't look comfortable"?


If you answered yes to that question, well I have some good news. The officially-licenced Mega Man slippers will be available this summer (23rd June, to be precise). 


Clothing and costume store Fun has unveiled this new pair of Mega Man slippers, which have been designed to resemble Mega Man's classic series look. They have a stitched Mega Man on the side, and red emblems on the sole. Surely, a much more comfortable option for lounging around the house in than Mega Man's own, robotic booties.

This collection will include the first three Metal Gear Solid games - Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (both HD Collection versions), and will launch in the autumn.


However, the Konami website for the collection includes a blank space with "stay tuned for more information", which the PlayStation Store has revealed will be Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The boss of the European Commission has explained in detail why her agency approved Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal - and why she thinks the UK was wrong to block it.


In a speech given yesterday, European Commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager laid out the regulator's own "call of duty" to only block buyouts when really necessary.


"Merger control is by nature a forward-looking exercise," Vestager said. "But that power comes with challenges... And to make things even more complicated, for global deals many authorities are predicting the future, at the same time. Of course we cooperate, but disagreements sometimes happen. No less recently than last week, we cleared the Microsoft/Activision deal, while the CMA decided to block it."

The patch notes themselves are minimal, stating some audio bug fixes, a fix to the quest 'Camera Work in the Depths', and "several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience".


It's this last point that presumably covers the duplication glitches that seem to have been removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've not heard much from THQ Nordic's Alone in the Dark reboot since its surprise unveiling last year, but now the promising project is back with a 25th October release date and - for the impatient among us - a playable prologue that's available now.


The original Alone in the Dark, for those too young to remember, released in 1992 and offered a genuinely groundbreaking journey into the unknown. It's widely considered to be the granddaddy of the survival horror genre, pioneering the fixed-camera spook-house formula that would go on to influence the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill.


THQ Nordic's reimagined version of Alone in the Dark - which is being handled by Swedish developer Pieces Interactive with Soma and Amnesia: The Dark Descent writer Mikael Hedberg at the helm - takes the basic premise of the 1992 original, in which private detective Edward Carnby helps Emily Hartwood investigate her uncle's suicide at the gloomy Derceto Mansion, and cranks up the Southern Gothic as it attempts to filter the originals' blend of exploration, combat, puzzles, and story through a more modern lens.

Homeworld 3 is being developed by Blackbird Interactive and marks the first new numbered game in the series since Relic Entertainment's Homeworld 2 in 2003. However, news of its progress has been erratic following its official unveiling by publisher Gearbox in August 2019.


After an extended silence, the tail-end of 2021 bought a Q4 2022 launch window, but that then slipped to the "first half of 2023" so Blackbird could deliver the game "at the highest quality". Now, however, with time to hit its most recent release target rapidly running out, Gearbox has announced another delay, this time shifting Homeworld 3's release into early next year.

The original Cat Quest released in 2017, sending players, in the role of a brave feline warrior, on a quest to save their kidnapped sister. It was a wonderfully refreshing thing, taking everything you'd expect from an action-RPG - real-time combat, dungeon crawling, and equipment progression - and turning it into a breezy, super-streamlined, pick-up-and-play package. It also had more cat puns than is probably legal.


A sequel arrived two years later, offering a slightly evolved take on the original's formula - most notably introducing dogs (and, yes, dog puns) - and now The Gentlebros is getting ready to do it all over again in Cat Quest: Pirates of the Purribean.

We got an extended look at Spider-Man 2, and announcements of the much-rumoured Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, Bungie's next game Marathon, Haven's first title Fairgame$, and something called Concord. Actual gameplay and firm release dates were thin on the ground, however. And many of the games shown during PlayStation's event will also be available on Xbox.  
Was this a good games event, even if it wasn't a great PlayStation one? How do we feel about Sony's game roadmap now? Joining me to discuss all of that and much more are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider this your last-minute reminder that the annual Summer Games Done Quick is back this weekend, bringing another seven days of charity speedrunning action.


Things kick of this Sunday, 28th May, at 5.30pm BST for a bit of pre-show pre-amble, with the main speedrunning event getting underway half an hour later, beginning with AlphaDolphin's Any% run of Sonic Frontiers. From there, things continue onward throughout the week until proceedings wind down at around 9.25am on Sunday, 4th June.

Saber Interactive's hotly-anticipated (by me) sequel sees Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus stomp and shoot and generally smash to bits the xenos scum.


The video, below, shows more of this in action. I think it looks promising - you can see Saber's work on World War Z and its zombie swarm tech brought to bear here with the Tyranids.

Fallout: New Vegas is, of course, sensibly considered something of a classic, with Obsidian's open-world RPG refining and enriching the series' first trek into 3D - as seen in Bethesda Softworks' Fallout 3 - into an experience Eurogamer called "huge and sprawling, sometimes gaudy, even downright ugly at times – but always effortlessly, shamelessly entertaining".


"Obsidian has created a totally compelling world," contributor Dan Whitehead wrote in his 9/10 review back in 2010, "and its frustrations pale into insignificance compared to the immersive, obsessive experience on offer.

Speaking to Eurogamer in a recent interview, associate game director Joe Piepiora outlined how story will work as part of Diablo 4's quarterly seasonal releases, which are separate from the planned release of traditional Diablo expansions.

Unlike Diablo 3, Diablo 4 seasons include self-contained storylines that expand the world of Sanctuary, rather than continue the main campaign. The continuation of the story is reserved for expansions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were plenty of announcements during Sony's Playstation Showcase last night, but the one that stood out most to me was Phantom Blade Zero. This quickfire action RPG looks brilliant and oh so slick. It blends Chinese martial arts and punk together, to create a new direction its developer has dubbed "Kungfupunk".


In Phantom Blade Zero, you take on the role of Soul. According to Soulframe Liang, founder of the game's developer S-Game, Soul is "an elite assassin serving an elusive but powerful organisation known simply as 'The Order'." Soul was framed for the murder of this organisation's patriarch, and was then wounded in the "manhunt that ensued". Thankfully, he was saved from death by a "mystic healer". 


This all sounds enticing enough already, in my opinion, but there is more. While Soul may have been saved by this healer, there is a catch - the cure only lasts for 66 days, and Soul needs to find out who framed him for killing The Order's patriarch before time runs out. Of course, this will not be an easy job, and Soul will have to fight against "powerful foes and inhuman monstrosities" on his journey. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has cheekily pointed to the fact that many of tonight's big PlayStation Showcase announcements were also games you can play on Xbox Series X/S.


MGS3 remake Metal Gear Solid Delta, Bungie's new Marathon project, Alan Wake 2, Assassin's Creed Mirage and Dragon's Dogma 2 might not have featured Xbox logos in their trailers during Sony's show - but they are all coming to Xbox, as noted by tweet from Microsoft.


That tweet - posted right after Sony's show finished - is clearly meant as a bit of fun. But it does also highlight just how much of tonight's PlayStation Showcase will be available elsewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has released a teaser trailer for Destiny 2: The Final Shape, the "final chapter of the Light & Darkness Saga".


It sees the surprise return of Cayde-6, one of Destiny's most popular characters. It's been four expansions since Destiny players waved farewell to Cayde, the wise-cracking Hunter originally played by Nathan Fillion who was shot dead by Uldren Sov. He even got a touching memorial players can visit in Destiny 2's Tower hub.


The CGI trailer begins with Warlock chief Ikora Rey staring into a campfire, talking to Cayde as if he's still alive. "You've missed so much," she says, sadly. "I wish you could have been there."

        <updated>2023-05-24T21:17:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well! Bungie has finally unveiled its next project, and it's quite a surprise, whisking the developer back to its 90s roots for a revival of its classic first-person shooter series Marathon, reimagined as a PvP shooter for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


The original Marathon released in 1994 and went on to spawn two sequels, at which point Microsoft swooped in to purchase Bungie and the Halo franchise was born. Since then, Bungie has been on a quite the journey, working its way through multiple Halo sequels and two Destiny games, the latter of which have kept the studio busy for over a decade. So it's kind of fascinating to see it cast its gaze backward for its first new project as a Sony-owned studio.


The new Marathon is described as a "sci-fi PvP extraction shooter" featuring "evolving, persistent zones" that, while not a direct sequel to the earlier games, is set in the same universe. "PvP" is the key here, too with Bungie confirming it won't have a single-player campaign. It will, however, support cross-play and cross-save between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

"There are many reasons for this," the developer explained. "For one, a large number of have shifted to digital only. You can buy a Sony PlayStation 5 without a disc drive and Microsoft's Xbox Series S is a digital only console. It is not uncommon to release modern games as digital-only." It also argued "not releasing a disc helps keep the price of the game at $59.99/€59.99 and the PC version at $49.99/€49.99", and insisted it "did not want to ship a disc product and have it require a download for the game".


Alan Wake 2 will be available in two versions at launch: a standard edition costing £39.99/€49.99/$49.99 USD on PC and £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 on consoles, plus a deluxe edition priced at £54.99/€69.99/$69.99 on PC and £64.99/€79.99/$79.99 on consoles.

Sword of the Sea is Giant Squid's third release - following on from 2016's deep sea adventure Abzû and 2020's The Pathless - and its announcement trailer, aired during Sony's latest PlayStation Showcase, focuses on a lone explorer, known as The Wraith, sand-surfing their way through a strikingly rendered desert, all undulanting sands and ancient temples, that suddenly gives way to roaring waves and flying marine life.


Giant Squid's creative director Matt Nava (who served as art director on Journey, in case you're wondering why the art style looks familiar) calls Sword of the Sea the studio's "most ambitious game to date" on the PlayStation Blog, noting its "Hoversword" traversal sytem - a mix of "snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one" - is core to the experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three and a half years after its announcement, numerous delays, and a new developer later, Ubisoft's beleaguered Price of Persia: Sands of Time remake is still in the "conception" phase.


Ubisoft's "fully-fledged" Sands of Time remake was officially revealed in September 2020, with an anticipated release date of January the following year. However, its troubled development saw the publisher twice delay its release, before finally shifting control of the project from Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.


Following that major upheaval in May 2022, Ubisoft would only say its Sands of Time remake would release "when it's ready". However, a new development update on the Ubisoft website now suggests that "ready" may still be some considerable way off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Netflix's live-action The Witcher adaptation prepares for its return on 29th June, showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich has shared a little more on Henry Cavill's decision to hang up his shoulder-length Geralt wig after season 3, admitting the team 'had the choice to end the show' after Cavill's departure, but felt there were "just too many stories left to tell".


Netflix revealed The Witcher's third season would be Cavill's last in October 2022, much to the disappointment of fans - Cavill has, afterall, been one of the few genuinely bright spots in a deeply uneven adaptation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the show's popularity, Netflix confirmed that instead of winding the series down it had instead recast the lead role, with Liam Hemsworth stepping into Geralt of Rivia's shoes for season 4 onward.


Now, however, in an interview with Total Film (thanks Games Radar), showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich has confirmed the team was given the option to wrap the series up with Cavill's departure, but instead opted to press on. "I mean, we had the choice to have Geralt exit and to end the show," Hissirch explained, "[but] that's not something that we were willing to do. There's just too many stories left to tell."

A series of Japanese stores now have Assassin's Creed Mirage available to pre-order, with a release date set for 12th October. Ubisoft is yet to officially name a date for the game, though this would line up with previous Assassin's Creed launches. 


Japanese gaming website Gematsu noted on Twitter this afternoon that retailers in the country do not typically list titles with placeholder dates. The same day being listed across various major retailer chains also points to the date being legitimate.

The show will be an hour long, apparently, and I'll be live reporting everything going on while chatting with you in the comments, because I have four hands.
So what can we expect? Well, Final Fantasy 16 will no doubt feature highly, what with it being a timed exclusive for PlaySation 5 and all, and with it being due next month. Will we get a demo date, perhaps? I'd also expect a solid look at Insomniac's new Spider-Man 2 game, due this autumn, which we still haven't seen a great deal of.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) makes managing seccomp, SELinux and
AppArmor profiles within Kubernetes easier than ever. It allows cluster
administrators to define the profiles in a predefined custom resource YAML,
which then gets distributed by the SPO into the whole cluster. Modification and
removal of the security profiles are managed by the operator in the same way,
but that’s a small subset of its capabilities.
Another core feature of the SPO is being able to stack seccomp profiles. This
means that users can define a baseProfileName in the YAML specification, which
then gets automatically resolved by the operator and combines the syscall rules.
If a base profile has another baseProfileName, then the operator will
recursively resolve the profiles up to a ce…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-rumoured Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is real and getting a multi-platform release on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC according to a new report by Windows Central.


A Metal Gear Solid 3 remake was first rumoured in October 2021, when it was claimed Virtuos, a studio primarily known for its porting work, had been handed the development reins by Konami. The project has popped up intermittently since then, albeit never officially confirmed, and now Windows Central's Jez Corden says he's been able to "hard-confirm" it's real.


Corden also lends credence to a recent report by Insider Gaming, which claimed the remake would be a multi-platform release, contrary to speculation Sony might have snaffled it up as a PlayStation exclusive. According to Corden, the remake will indeed be coming to Xbox and PC alongside PlayStation, "despite a marketing deal".

Netflix has been threatening a crackdown on password sharing as a means of shoring up is stagnating subscriber numbers for some time now, and it began rolling out a related series of measures built around the notion of a designated "primary location" in February, albeit initially only in a limited number of countries.


Since then, Netflix's measures have continued to spread around the globe, and, as of today, are live in the UK. The streaming service says it has started emailing members that share their accounts with users outside their household, telling them they'll need to cough up an additional £4.99 a month if they want to continue doing so.

As far as the Destiny specific stuff goes, Season of the Deep (as today's update is known) is themed around Saturn's moon of Titan, where an uncharted ocean awaits. It introduces weekly Deep Dive missions, the Salvage seasonal activity, and fishing for Season Pass purchasers, while Lightfall + Annual Pass or Lightfall Dungeon Key owners gain access to a mysterious new dungeon - the first of two due this year - starting this Friday, 26th May.


As for Destiny 2's PlayStation collaboration, that's happening over on the premium store, where Bungie has shoved a bunch of cosmetics inspired by Sony's biggest games. With interest still high after its barnstorming TV adaptation, The Last of Us gets the most representation here, with a three-item Cordyceps Bundle featuring everyone's favourite fungi to be with. Specifically, there's the Clicker (Ghost), Blooming Terror (Ship), and Quarantine Runner (Sparrow).

The app recently introduced sweeping changes to its remote raiding feature, with players limited to using five remote raid passes a day, and each pass also now priced higher. Niantic said it had made these changes with the future of Pokémon Go in mind, and to ensure the game was still focused on its core pillars of exploration and social interaction.


But alongside criticism of Niantic's decision - which Steranka told Eurogamer last week in an interview that he had fully expected - the company's employees have also been targeted with personal abuse. Today, Steranka took to Twitter to highlight one such example.

Two Spider-Men join Fortnite today, including fan-favourite Miles Morales in his Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse guise. Joining him is Spider-Man 2099 - aka Irish-Mexican Spidey-person Miguel O'Hara. 


Both Spider-Men are, of course, stars of Sony's upcoming animated movie sequel (out next month) - which this latest Fortnite crossover is designed to promote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has released a new patch for fantasy adventure Forspoken, ahead of the release of its In Tanta We Trust DLC on Friday.


One feature is an adjustment to the frequency and "content" of the "banter" between Frey and Cuff during open world activities. The game already has an option to amend the amount of Cuff chatter, but as players criticised the game's dialogue, it seems Square Enix has continued to make tweaks.


Another interesting change is to the Tanta's Familiars: cat creatures Frey can find on her journey and who inhabit the game's rest spots. Now they will follow Frey around to collect mana and items - I'm picturing Frey accompanied by an army of cute cats, which sounds adorable.

An email seen by the New York Times  regarding 'Blizzard Diffusion' was sent to employees earlier this year. Blizzard Diffusion is the company's internal AI tool, which has allegedly been trained as an image generator on Blizzard's own titles (its name is a play on Stable Diffusion, another AI image generation platform). 


Reportedly, this tool was being used "to help generate concept art for game environments as well as characters and their outfits". Adham also made mention of possible tools for "autonomous, intelligent, in-game NPCs," "procedurally assisted level design" and AI-assisted "voice cloning," "game coding" and "anti-toxicity" in his email.

The class action suit was lodged this month by an unidentified minor - albeit via his legal guardian (thanks, Axios). The suit claims that Nintendo's gacha-style rewards system in Mario Kart Tour violated consumer protection and business profession laws.


Specifically, the boy is seeking compensation for Mario Kart Tour's Spotlight Pipes, which let you pay real-world money for in-game Ruby currency, and spend them on chances for randomised rewards.

Each game in the Final Fantasy series is individual - only a couple have had direct sequels - but Yoshida admitted this can be tough for marketing as some players approach the latest game wondering if the story continues from previous games.


"A lot of players are going to come in and they're going to look at it like a comic book where you have to read from the beginning to know what's going on now," Yoshida told GQ in an interview.

Naming streets in the Vegas neighbourhood isn't an easy job, project construction manager Andrea Miller told local news station KLAS 8 News Now (via Polygon). However, Miller was inspired to use the above names as her sons are "obsessed" with Pokémon.

Summersett previously discussed the dynamic between Link and Zelda in an interview with The Gamer, in which she stated: "I know that they are in a relationship with each other, it's active, there's a lot of care and a lot of listening, and I just love that about it."


The quote was notable for going further than Nintendo itself has officially gone in defining the bond between The Legend of Zelda's two main characters, and while it was simply Summersett's own opinion, as voice actress for the series' namesake, it was pounced upon by fans.

Some publications began reporting potential co-op support in Spider-Man 2 earlier this week after fans unearthed comments made by Miles Morales voice actor Nadji Jeter last September. When asked if Spider-Man 2 would feature co-op during a SacAnime Summer 2022 Q&A, Jeter replied, "I don't know if it's been announced or not, but I think so."


Co-op speculation has followed Spider-Man 2 ever since Insomniac announced Peter Parker and Miles Morales would both play a prominent role in the sequel, but the studio has now shot down co-op chatter once and for all. After a fan tweeted to ask if co-op was on the cards, it replied wrote, "Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest is almost upon us, kicking off with a live showcase before splintering into a "season" of disparate publisher events in the absence of E3. But first that showcase, which is now confirmed to be two hours in length, and featuring at least a couple of "pretty big" things.


Summer Game Fest gets underway on 8th June, with a live show consisting of premieres, gameplay demos, and announcements. That's pretty much as far as details went in previous teases, but now, in an interview on the Epic Games Store, show host and producer Geoff Keighley has now shared a little more about what to expect from the format.


Alongside its now confirmed two-hour duration, Keighley suggests Summer Game Fest live will be a little more laidback compared to the bombastic Game Awards, offering a "chance to talk to the developers and showcase games and give a little bit more context around games". While the exact line-up still appears to be in flux, Keighley does say he expects the Summer Game Fest live show to feature three or four things that are "pretty big for this audience."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lars Gustavsson, former creative director on DICE's long-running Battlefield series, has unveiled his new studio TTK Games, which is currently developing an online shooter.


Gustavsson departed DICE last September after more than 20 years at the studio, having - as EA wrote in its announcement - "decided he is ready for a new adventure". Gustavsson offered no suggestion of what that new adventure might be at the time, but all has now been revealed.


Gustavsson's new studio, the Stockholm-based TTK Games, has been co-founded by four former members of DICE; Gustavsson will serve as CEO and creative director, while Daniel Berlin (previously lead world designer and design director on Battlefield) is senior design director. They're joined by chief technical officer and technical director Vidar Nygren (technical director on Battlefield), plus art director Peter Hoyles, who served as studio art director at DICE LA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yuke's, the renowned Japanese developer responsible for nearly two decades of popular WWE games, marks its return to the wrestling genre next month, when AEW: Fight Forever launches fo Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 29th June.


Yuke's has been associated wrestling ever since its inception in 1995, and the studio's long association with WWE began in 2000, with the launch of WWF SmackDown. It continued to work on the WWE licence until 2018's WWE 2K19, when publisher 2K decided to hand the reins exclusively to the US-based Visual Concepts, which had co-developed the series with Yuke's since 2013. Unfortunately, Visual Concepts' solo debut proved so disastrous 2K made the unprecedented move of skipping the long-running series' annual release for two years in a row, only bringing it back in 2022.


So with WWE 2K temporarily out of commision, wrestling fans were quite intrigued when, in 2020, it was announced Yuke's would be returning to the genre with a game for WWE rival AEW, under the watch of publisher THQ Nordic. And we'll finally get a chance to see what the developer's been up when AEW: Fight Forever launches this June.

Set to launch on 1st June for Lego VIP members, or 4th June for the rest of us, this new model will cost you a pretty penny. Its recommended retail price is £229.99, or $269.99 / €269.99 for those outside the UK. 


The set is a collaboration between Bandai Namco and the Lego Group, released to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of Pac-Man. It features the upper half of a Pac-Man cabinet.

Its style - instrumentation, arrangement - differs across the series, reflecting the world and characters of each game.


In Final Fantasy 16, the battle fanfare has (for the first time outside Final Fantasy 14) lyrics and is sung by a choir. Not only are those lyrics in Ancient Greek, they're a major plot spoiler for the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation head Jim Ryan believes Sony's current strategy of releasing games on PC several years after their console launch is working well, and fans find the extra wait for a PC port "acceptable".


Chatting to Famitsu (via IGN), Ryan said Sony understood "the importance of PS5 exclusive titles" such as last year's God of War Ragnarök, and as such dismissed the idea of launching games on PC at the same time as their console counterparts. "PlayStation Studios' main responsibility is to make games for the latest PlayStation hardware that players will enjoy," Ryan explained. He went on to state the company is increasing its PS5 exclusives and "staggering the release of the PC versions". 


This comment from Ryan echoes those of PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, who previously stated that the company's first-party releases will likely take "at least a year" to launch on PC, with the possible exception of live-service games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's blockbuster fighting game franchise Super Smash Bros. isn't a good fit for online play, its creator Masahiro Sakurai has said. 


Speaking in his latest YouTube video on game development, Sakurai discussed the addition of online play to the series in Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii. In it, he lined out why he believed the series was better suited for local competition - for both philosophical and technical reasons.


Indeed, Sakurai addressed Nintendo's often shaky online servers, saying that "network lag tends to make the game a pretty choppy experience". Ultimately, though, it sounds like adding online play was something he had to do: "when it comes to technical issues, it doesn't really matter what I personally think," he said. "If my job is to do it, I'll do it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember when we confirmed the devastating news that no, you cannot pet the dog in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Well, it seems like some pooch-loving players are determined to prove otherwise.

That's right. Despite there being no formal or programmed way to physically pet Link's canine companion, players have developed strange and wonderful ways to do it anyway.

The Merciless Monstrosity event will roll out next months, June 2023, and ushers in new quests, cosmetics, and a completely new zone and class, too.

"The creation of Sanctuary by Inarius and Lilith is a storied tale; its impact can still be felt today," Blizzard teases. "The Merciless Monstrosity event, Children of Lilith Battle Pass, and Hatred’s Heritage Phantom Market will be experienceable expressions of Sanctuary’s matriarch. Your opportunity to let sin flow freely will arrive in early June."

In a Twitter thread, indie team Rusty Lake detailed the trouble it has experienced securing its own username for its 240K+ member Discord community. 

Discord announced plans to change its usernames earlier this month. At present, usernames are case sensitive and have a four-digit identifier, called a discriminator, appended to create a unique username, but the new changes remove the need for the discriminator, meaning you don't have to remember the random number combination when trying to add friends.

The board game - which can be played solo or with up to four players - was first unveiled back in March, and has been backed by over 5500 people. 

"We can tell that the designers had played Dead Cells and that they weren't interested in simply doing a carbon copy," The Motion Twin team and Arthur Décamp, Dead Cells Game Director says of the project. "They had thought deeply about how to best adapt Dead Cells into board game format. The overarching principles of the game have been preserved (the energy, the visceral nature of combats, and the build options) without altering the experience expected for a modern board game.

<blockquote><p>Peru in 2020 began requiring any foreign fishing boat entering its ports to use a vessel monitoring system allowing its activities to be tracked in real time 24 hours a day. The equipment, which tracks a vessel&#8217;s geographic position and fishing activity through a proprietary satellite communication system, sought to provide authorities with visibility into several hundred Chinese squid vessels that every year amass off the west coast of South America.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Instead of increasing oversight, the new Peruvian regulations appear to have driven Chinese ships away from the country&#8217;s ports&#8212;and kept crews made up of impoverished Filipinos and Indonesians at sea for longer periods, exposing them to abuse, according to new research published by Peruvian fishing consultancy Artisonal...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

After School Hero was one of several stretch goals detailed when developer PlatinumGames opted to take a remastered version of Wii U cult classic The Wonderful 101 to Kickstarter back on 2020, and promised a side-scrolling adventure focused on a "young hero" named Luka.


The Wonderful 101: Remastered's other DLC stretch goal, a Time Attack mode, launched back in 2021, so it's been a bit of a wait for the DLC originally referred to as "Luka's First Mission".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 is finally official after several weeks of teases, but a few mysteries still remain. And it looks like Amazon might have inadvertently solved one of those ahead of schedule by leaking the characters included in the game's Kombat Pack DLC.


Mortal Kombat 1 - which, as rumoured, will be a reboot of sorts, taking place in a "reborn" universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang - is set to release on 19th September, and it'll be accompanied by a Kombat Pack providing early access to six additional playable characters and five assist characters known as Kameo Fighters.


At the time of Mortal Kombat 1's announcement, publisher Warner Bros. confirmed the Kombat Pack would be included in Mortal Kombat 1's Premium and Kollector's Editions, but neglected to tell prospective purchasers what additional characters they'd get in return for their money.

Described as an "immersive live experience that celebrates more than three decades of music from Sega's iconic mascot", Sonic Symphony promises a "musical tour" through the series' history. It'll feature "classic 8-bit and 16-bit tunes to rock and EDM songs", all played by a full symphony orchestra and rock band - and accompanied by on-screen Sonic footage for the benefit of those requiring eye stimulation along with the amusement to their ears.


Sega and show organiser MGP Live have announced two dates for the Sonic Symphony World Tour so far, beginning with a performance at London's Barbican Hall on 16th September this year. After that, it'll depart the UK and head over to the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, for a second show on 30th September.

Many publishers have adopted this $70 price point as standard, including the likes of Sony, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Earlier this week, Sega also suggested it could adopt a similar approach for its future releases, and stated it was "keeping an eye on market conditions".


As for those who have already increased prices to this higher point, Zelnick claimed he hasn't seen any real resistance from players so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary game developer John Carmack has defended his decision to attend a science fiction and fantasy convention for "non-leftist" writers, following social media criticism.


Carmack announced he would attend BasedCon this week via Twitter, prompting displeasure from followers upset at the event's description as an alternative to the "publishing industry's hostility to authors who are critical of progressive dogma". 


The event's name stems from the internet slang "based", which BasedCon's own About page describes as "the opposite of social justice activism" and identified by "based beliefs" such as "discriminating against white people is racism", "men cannot give birth", and also "guns don't kill people, people kill people".

More interesting is that the game's item duplication glitches remain intact.

On 26th May, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will get their hands on Super Mario Advance, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2, and Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. 


In Super Mario Advance, players are tasked with launching a load of vegetables and other items at their enemies, in order to reign victorious. This is the Game Boy Advance version of Super Mario Bros. 2 - the game that introduced the world to Nintendo's pink, bow wearing, anthropomorphic dinosaur, Birdo. Birdo is a bit of a favourite here at Eurogamer, and you can find out more about her in our article dedicated to the Nintendo icon here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer 2.21, which now owns the rights to Adeline Software's much-loved Little Big Adventure series, recently announced it was working on a ground-up "remaster" of both titles, and we've now been given a tiny glimpse of the Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up in action.


The original Little Big Adventure, if you're unfamiliar, released back in 1994 and delivered a memorable blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that followed young hero Twinsen as he attempted to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock. A sequel then followed three years later.


2.21 first discussed its plans to remaster Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 back in March, explaining it was taking on the projects while it continued discussions with publishers to make its previously announced Little Big Adventure reboot a reality.

When Sonic Prime was announced back in February 2021, Netflix described it as a 24-episode animated series that would send Sonic on a "journey of self-discovery and redemption" in which the "fate of a strange new multiverse" was in his hands.


Sonic Prime's initial batch of episodes saw Sonic traversing the Shatterverse - a collection of alternative dimensions formed after Dr. Eggman's Paradox Prism was destroyed in battle - in a quest to restore the universe, all with a little help from different versions of his familiar friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maquette, the striking "recursive" first-person puzzle adventure from developer Graceful Decay and publisher Annapurna Interactive, is making its way to Switch next week, on 25th May.


Originally released for PlayStation and PC back in 2021, Maquette builds an ingenious series of spatial challenges inspired by the small-scale sculptors' models that give the game its name.


Maquettes are sculptures crafted before embarking on a full-scale project, and in Graceful Decay's puzzler, that's reflected in environments that contain smaller versions of themselves. Crucially in Maquette, changes made to one environment affect the other - so if you were to, say, place a cube in a tiny courtyard in front of you, it would then materialise in the full-size courtyard you stand in, giving you a means to progress to the next area - and on it goes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has discusssed "timed slices" and games with ads internally, to offer different monetisation methods to developers.

"We talk a lot about Game Pass because subscription is the latest option that we scaled: you have pay-to-play, then there was free-to-play, and then we introduced Game Pass," Sarah Bond, corporate vice president for game creator experience and ecosystem at Xbox, told Rolling Stone UK.

"We've talked about how we're experimenting with other models, like what does it mean for advertising in games which is more prevalent in mobile – are there models of that that work well in PC and console? Are there other models where you might have timed slices of games and stuff like that?

SM2, as this project was known, was a Call of Duty client based off the Modern Warfare 2 engine, complete with maps and weapons from across the series. 


However, despite the evident dedication from all involved with SM2, the team has been forced to "[shut] down operations permanently", after it received a cease and desist letter from Call of Duty publisher, Activision.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet first arrived in November last year, and until now have been unable to connect to Pokémon Home, the service which lets you transfer creatures to and from other Pokémon games. 


That all changes next week, when Scarlet and Violet will gain Home compatibility. This means being able to import any supported creature from any of the mainline games supported by Home at present, alongside the previous storage service Pokémon Bank, and also Pokémon Go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed puzzle game The Case of the Golden Idol is coming to Nintendo Switch. After a period of PC exclusivity, the murder mystery head scratcher will be making its console debut next Thursday 25th May. 


On its release, Switch players will be able to experience all of the game's redacted and perplexing scenarios in a whole new way, thanks to touchscreen controls. For those who don't want to get their screens all mucky, however, there is also a custom developed controller layout option for gathering up evidence. This Switch release also boasts an overhauled UI, for the "best user experience" when playing the game in either docked or handheld mode. 


As well as the base game, Switch owners will also have the opportunity to get their hands on Golden Idol's first expansion - The Spider of Lanka. This DLC kicks off a year before The Case of the Golden Idol's first scenario, and follows the story of Albert Cloudsley and Oberon Geller as they make their maiden voyage to the Kingdom of Lanka.

        <updated>2023-05-18T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia has officially unveiled its first mid-range Ada Lovelace graphics card, the RTX 4060 Ti, with both 8GB and 16GB variants at $399/£389 and $499 respectively. The 8GB card is the first to be released, with sales beginning on May 24th, while the 16GB variant debuts in July. The firm also detailed its mainstream RTX 4060 GPU, also coming in July, to debut at $299. 
All three models ought to offer a reasonable boost in performance over their predecessors, while also adding DLSS 3 frame generation - which is perhaps more impactful on mid-range hardware than it is on the likes of the RTX 4090 which is powerful enough without it. That should allow the 4060 family to be a reasonable choice for gaming at 1080p with maxed settings (including RT / DLSS), or at 1440p with some settings reductions. 
On average, Nvidia is claiming the 4060 Ti is 1.15x faster than the 3060 Ti and 1.6x faster than the 2060 Super (1.7x and 2.6x faster with DLSS 3). Similarly, the RTX 4060 is 1.2x faster than RTX 3060 and 1.6x faster than RTX 2060 (1.7x and 2.3x with DLSS 3).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt has called upon the country's regulator to understand its "wider responsibilities" to promote economic growth, following its recent block of Microsoft's proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout.


The remarks, reported by The Telegraph, follow questions from MPs this week directed at bosses of the Competition and Markets Authority regarding the decision which has scuppered Microsoft's ambitions here in the UK - and potentially worldwide.


Both Microsoft and Activision have criticised the UK for disrupting the deal, and have labelled the country as being "bad for business" post-Brexit. The remarks come in stark contrast to the vision for the UK's tech industry previously set out by Hunt and UK prime minister Rishi Sunak to become the "Silicon Valley" of Europe.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) is a feature-rich
operator for Kubernetes to make managing seccomp, SELinux and
AppArmor profiles easier than ever. Recording those profiles from scratch is one
of the key features of this operator, which usually involves the integration
into large CI/CD systems. Being able to test the recording capabilities of the
operator in edge cases is one of the recent development efforts of the SPO and
makes it excitingly easy to play around with seccomp profiles.
Recording seccomp profiles with spoc record
The v0.8.0 release of the Security Profiles Operator shipped a new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take-Two has released its latest yearly earnings report and there're intriguing predictions buried within, suggesting Grand Theft Auto 6 could well be launching as soon as next year.


As spotted by IGN, publisher Take-Two is predicting it will generate an absolutely staggering $8B in net bookings for its 2025 fiscal year (beginning April 2024), as it launches "several groundbreaking titles". That's a significant jump up from the $5.3B it's just reported for its financial year 2023, and an even bigger leap from the $3.5B it reported in the year prior, suggesting something major is due between next April and March 2025.


"For the last several years, we have been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success," Take-Two wrote in its earnings report.

First released for iOS in 2019 - and later for Android, Switch, and PlayStation - Sky: Children of the Light is a bit of an unusual thing, blending all sorts of elements to create a delicate adventure spanning the seven realms of a beautiful kingdom located among the clouds.


There are puzzley-platformy bits, story vignettes, as well as live-service staples like a season pass, and it's all build around a gently collaborative multiplayer core, designed to encourage "compassion, friendship, and altruism".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlizzCon is back this November, with its first in-person event since 2019 following several years of digital-only events and no-shows as Blizzard navigated a pandemic and workplace controversy.


As announced on the Blizzard website, BlizzCon 2023 will take place from 3rd-4th November at California's Anaheim Convention Center. Beyond that, details are fairly non-existent at present, but the studio says it'll have news on "ticketing information, cosplay and other competition details, and more" next month.


BlizzCon 2023 will mark the show's first in-person event in four years, following two highly controversial showings in 2018 and 2019 - the first playing host to Blizzard's infamously bungled reveal of free-to-play mobile game Diablo Immortal and the second featuring a limp non-apology from then-CEO J. Allen Brack, who failed to offer much in the way of a convincing response after Blizzard suspended a Hearthstone player for expressing pro-Hong Kong views.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a month of teases, it looks like tomorrow's the day the next Mortal Kombat game - not Mortal Kombat 12, according to reports - will get its official reveal.


Series developer NetherRealm has now released a short video teasing some unspecified announcement tomorrow, 18th May, at 2pm BST/6am PT. And given its title - "Tomorrow is a new dawn" - and its arrival after a bunch of teases hinting at a reveal for the next Mortal Kombat, it doesn't seem too farfetched to assume that's exactly what we'll get.


As you'll no doubt have noticed if you've been riding the hype train so far, NetherRealm's latest video features the same time-based imagery seen in its previous trailers - the most recent of which saw a ticking clock gradually approach '12' before leapfrogging it entirely to land on '1'.

Jagged Alliance 3 was initially announced all the way back in 2004, when televisions still had dials and text messages were conveyed by pigeons. At the time, Russian studio MiST Land South was attached as its developer, but after that arrangement failed to reach fruition, original publisher Strategy First went through a succession of studios with similarly unsuccessful results before the Jagged Alliance rights changed hands in 2010.


Five years later, the rights pinballed again, this time to Nordic Games, and six years after that, THQ Nordic revealed that finally, finally, development on a third entry in the Jagged Alliance series would resume, this time under the watch of Tropico developer Haemimont Games.

The Expanse: A Telltale Series has been developed by Telltale and Deck Nine (Life is Strange: True Colors) and serves as a prequel to the popular sci-fi TV show. It features Camina Drummer as the main protagonist. Drummer works on The Artemis spaceship and, as you'd expect from a Telltale game, players will be tasked with making some tough decisions as she and her scavenger crew negotiate their way through the edges of The Belt.

This trailer first leaked online earlier in the month - though legal notices and a fairly successful community boycott stemmed its spread.  


Here we get our first look at The Hunger Games' Josh Hutcherson, cast as a new security guard for creepy pizza chain Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. An evil-looking Matthew Lillard (Scream, Scooby-Doo) can also be seen.

Earlier this year, a court in Hermagor ruled that the football game's FUT packs violated the country's gambling laws. At this time, lawyer Ulrich Salburg stated the plaintiffs - which included one minor - had allegedly "gambled away" hundreds of euros on FUT packs when the uncertain monetary value of the packs purportedly violated the Austrian Gaming Act.


Consequently, the court alleged that the controversial loot boxes could be classified as "illegal gambling".

Accessible via the Dead Space remake's Steam page, the new 90-minute trial version requires players to first install the full game then hit the "play now" button to begin their free trial period, whereupon a timer will keep track of the minutes still remaining.


There doesn't appear to be a progression cap on the trial, meaning players are free to continue as far as they can before their hour and a half expires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has cancelled Overwatch 2's much-trumpeted but long-delayed PvE mode, admitting development "hasn't made the progress we would have hoped."


PvE was presented as a flagship feature of Overwatch 2 when the team-based shooter sequel was unveiled in 2019, but, as development dragged on and 2022 arrived, Blizzard announced it would be "decoupling" PvE from PvP in order to get the game into players' hands sooner.


To that end, a fully PvP-focused version of Overwatch 2 finally launched last October, and little has been heard about its once-key PvE component in the months since. Now though, in a newly aired developer livestream, Overwatch 2 executive producer Jared Neuss has confirmed the game's PvE mode is officially dead.

The news comes as part of the publisher's Financial Year 2023 earnings report, the first earnings report since its disappointing quarterly update in January, in which it announced an "increased cautiousness over the coming years" and the cancellation of three unannounced projects.


In today's end-of-year report, Ubisoft recorded net bookings of €1.74B, marking an 18% year-on-year decrease for the publisher, but there were some notable wins for its biggest franchises, including a record number of active users for the Assassin's Creed franchise over the last year, coming it at 44% higher than Origins and 19% higher than Odyssey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has said it's feeling "really confident" Diablo 4 will enjoy a smooth launch following a series of server stress tests.


The developer held a "Server Slam" event over the weekend to test the upcoming action role-playing game's servers one final time ahead of launch in June. The event seemed to go smoothly, with most players reporting little to no queue time and, when in-game, improved performance compared to that seen in previous tests.


Speaking to Eurogamer in an interview in London today, Diablo 4 art director John Mueller and associate game director Joe Piepiora said Blizzard is feeling good about the launch because it had learned so much from the various tests.

CMA bosses Marcus Bokkerink and Sarah Cardell faced repeated questions from the UK government's Business and Trade Committee this morning relating to the decision, just a day after the European Commission voted to approve the deal in the EU.


MPs asked the CMA to explain why it had reached a different decision on the deal to its European counterpart, and repeatedly questioned whether the CMA had considered the effects of blocking a deal like this on the UK's international reputation.

Its somewhat simple design, which sees a collection of vacant containers for players to shoot their way around, is a mainstay of the series. However, the original map nearly didn't make its way into Call of Duty at all. As hard as it is to imagine now, Shipment's inclusion in 2007's Modern Warfare was "truly an accident".


Speaking to Dexerto, Infinity Ward multiplayer design director Geoff Smith shared more backstory on Shipment's genesis.

The blank, unblinking eyes, the polished sheen of his mask's surface - it all leads to Link looking like a serial killer. (And considering what some of you are doing to those poor Koroks, perhaps this isn't too far off.)


This is, of course, Link's design from the recent Nintendo Switch remake of classic Game Boy adventure The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. Except there, it was part of the game's cute toy diarama aesthetic. In Tears of the Kingdom, Link's longer body and glassy-eyed expression give off a very different vibe.

The game - currently a PlayStation console exclusive - has now received a new Xbox rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). 


As spotted by Twitter user @MACOS380, Stray has been rated as E for Everyone 10+, with the ESRB noting the game features animated blood and fantasy violence. "Players sometimes encounter parasitic blobs/mice-like bots that can attack and kill the cat. Players can access a UV light to defeat the mice-like bots, causing them to explode and emit splashes of coloured liquid," the rating summary explains.

With Kubernetes 1.27, we (SIG Auth) are moving Key Management Service (KMS) v2 API to beta.
What is KMS?
One of the first things to consider when securing a Kubernetes cluster is encrypting etcd data at
rest. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to
perform this encryption.
KMS v1 has been a feature of Kubernetes since version 1.10, and is currently in beta as of version
v1.12. KMS v2 was introduced as alpha in v1.25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a good long while since we first laid eyes on dreamy Ecuadorian football adventure Despelote, but now, after several years away from the spotlight, it's resurfaced with a publisher and a planned 2024 release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.


Created by Julián Cordero and Sebastian Valbuena, Despelote is described as a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life adventure about "childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001". It's set during a period when the country's football team was on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time, helping instil a sense of hope in a population still reeling from a major financial crisis. 


That translates to "bittersweet and sometimes dreamy" game of kick-abouts and conversations, in which sees players - viewing the world through the eyes and ears of eight-year-old Julián - explore a dense corner of Quito, "full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five years after free-to-play multiplayer mech shooter Hawken was pulled offline following a tumultuous development, the brand is being revived by 505 Games as the PvE-focused, and initially single-player, Hawken Reborn.


The original Hawken burst onto the scene back in 2011 with an eye-catching work-in-progress trailer, but it struggled to find an audience once out in the real world. A failed early access attempt in 2014 saw development stall until a "relaunch" in 2017, but even that wasn't enough to get bums in mechs, and the game's PC servers were yanked for good the following year.


Which does make Hawken something of an odd choice for a revival, but here we are, five years later, with the free-to-play Hawken Reborn now listed on Steam and poised to launch into early access as a "genuinely early-in-development" title this Wednesday, 17th May.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just 12 months after its full launch, development is ending on free-to-play battle royale game Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodhunt, with its developer Sharkmob blaming the title's failure "reach the critical mass needed" to continue support.


Bloodhunt was announced toward the end of 2020 and, following a limited Steam early access release, recieved its full launch on PlayStation and PC last April. It offered players a vampiric spin on the well-worn battle royale formula, setting them loose across the rain-soaked, moon-drenched streets and rooftops of Prague, armed with supernatural parkour abilities and other clan-specific powers - plus, rather more boringly, guns.


It made for an interesting twist on a familiar genre - even if Eurogamer's Robert Purchese didn't much like the whole shooty thing when he played it back in early access - but that clearly wasn't enough to attact and retain the kind of player base Bloodhunt needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Molasses Flood, the CD-Projekt-owned studio currently working on The Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, has been hit by layoffs following the game's recent reboot.


Development on Project Sirius - previously described as a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience - was confirmed to have stalled back in March, after CD Projekt re-evaluated the "scope and commercial potential of the original concept". At the time, the company told investors it was "formulating a new framework" for the game that was better "aligned with [its] strategy".


Last week, CD Projekt shared an update on Project Sirius, announcing its "work on defining a new framework" was now complete. But that news was followed by growing reports of layoffs at the Boston-based The Molasses Flood, which was acquired by CD Projekt in 2021, with the studio's technical narrative designer Robert Bailey, environment artist Eleanore Falck, senior environment artist and world builder Gannon Jasper, and art producer Caryn M. Boehm, all revealing they had lost their jobs in tweets shared since last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having left us a vague "June" launch window for its Layers of Fear remake over the last few months, developer Bloober Team is finally ready to talk specifics, confirming its "psychedelic horror chronicle" will be releasing for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 15th June.


Layers of Fear is a bit of an unusual proposition, taking Bloober Team's two previous Layers of Fear titles (as well as the first game's Inheritance DLC), then reimagining it all as a single, interlinking narrative, featuring striking Unreal Engine 5 visuals, new gameplay elements - including a lantern to ward off shadowy terrors - and expanded plot lines.


This time around, the familiar unravellings of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece and a legendary actor making one final movie on a labyrinthine ocean liner - as featured in Layers of Fear 1 and 2 respectively - are accompanied by a new "story chapter" following the painter's rarely seen wife, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer, tying the whole thing together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon has announced fresh plans to adapt The Lord of the Rings into a new MMO "adventure", developed in-house by the studio behind New World, for PC and consoles.


The project will feature "the beloved stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings", adapted from Tolkien's original books, as licensed by rights owner Embracer. (Don't expect this to tie-in specifically with the Peter Jackson movie trilogy, or even Amazon's own Rings of Power show, set a thousand years before.)


"Bringing players a fresh take on The Lord of the Rings has long been an aspiration for our team, and we're honoured and grateful that Middle-earth Enterprises is entrusting us with this iconic world," Amazon Games boss Christoph Harmann said. "We're also pleased to be expanding our relationship with Embracer Group following our Tomb Raider deal last year, as they've proven to be excellent collaborators."

According to 3D artist Thomas of Twitter account Stylized Station, there is a lot involved to get it just right. It takes "a ton of smoke and mirrors in the background, without anyone ever realising it," they explained in a very thorough Twitter thread, noting "creating real-time simulated water is still really hard to do".


Thomas stated that most developers use a variety of "cheats" and techniques that see things such as textures, VFX sprites, normal maps, and basic geometry "smashed together" in order to give the "illusion of flowing water".

The European Commission had been one of three major regulators standing in the way of the deal, alongside the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - the latter of which dramatically blocked the deal last month, dealing a sizable blow to it succeeding overall. Microsoft is now set to appeal that decision.


In Brussels, however, it's better news for Microsoft - after a couple of concessions ended up winning over EU regulators.

Link is also making his merry way through Hyrule's many regions and camps in a range of eclectic creations, from mechs to trucks and tanks.


As a reminder, Link's new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects, and with a bit of creativity players can conjure up their own vehicles and such to beetle across Hyrule. 


While I have been happy enough to just place a fan on the back of my timber board to make it go, others clearly have a much better imagination (and a lot more patience, I won't lie, I am still finding Ultrahand quite fiddly to get the hang of) than I do. As a result, there have been some truly remarkable Ultrahand designs making the rounds online.

As with its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, Link can search the lands of Hyrule to find these woodland spirits, and return the seeds to Hestu. As in Breath of the Wild, Hestu will then add these seeds to his prized maracas, do a little shimmy, and grant you a new weapon slot. It's all very wholesome. 


Or, at least it was in Breath of the Wild. However, Tears of the Kingdom has upped the ante when it comes to Korok puzzles. This time around, Link often has to reunite two separated Korok companions. This sounds innocent enough - who doesn't want to see two long lost friends reunited? Well, apparently many Tears of the Kingdom players, that's who. 


Thanks to the sequel's new Ultrahand ability, which allows Link to pick up, move, and rotate objects (including Koroks), many players out there have taken to fusing these poor blighters to homemade crucifixes, rockets and even spit roasting the innocent spirits.

Aonuma agreed Ocarina of Time did create a format but it was ultimately restrictive for the designers, while Breath of the Wild offered a new type of play.

How can Pod start-up be accelerated on nodes in large clusters? This is a common issue that
cluster administrators may face.
This blog post focuses on methods to speed up pod start-up from the kubelet side. It does not
involve the creation time of pods by controller-manager through kube-apiserver, nor does it
include scheduling time for pods or webhooks executed on it.
We have mentioned some important factors here to consider from the kubelet's perspective, but
this is not an exhaustive list. As Kubernetes v1.27 is released, this blog highlights
significant changes in v1.27 that aid in speeding up pod start-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the biggest boxed video game launch of the year so far in the UK.

According to our sister site GamesIndustry.biz, that makes it the series' biggest ever launch week in the UK, surpassing the launches of even early games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time which were only available physically at the time. 

According to GI and the GfK charts, Tears of the Kingdom's instant pole position pushes Hogwarts Legacy from its top spot, and moves Star Wars Jedi: Survivor into third place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metacritic has finally opened The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom open to user reviews, and over three hundred players have left mixed or negative feedback.

Although The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now the highest-rated game of the year thus far on Metacritic - and the highest-rated game of all time on OpenCritic – and industry analysts are opining that Nintendo's all-new adventure will impact the charts not just for the next few months, but "years", some fans are making their disappointment more than clear, and whilst the critic score sits at a lofty 96, the user score aggregated from over 1600 reviewers is 8.5.

Yes, admittedly, some people are devastated that you cannot pet the dog, but that doesn't account for the hundreds of reviews that cite the sequel hasn't address the purported issues of its predecessor, calls the gameplay "boring", or reports ongoing performance issues.

Developer Soda Den took to social media over the weekend to claim that the game was removed "without [its] knowledge or consent" following "issues" with publisher Crytivo.

"As you may have noticed, the Roots of Pache Steam page is temporarily offline," the statement begins. "We are sad to report that we have been engaged in a dispute with Crytivo over the rights to Roots of Pacha. We worked hard to amicably resolve our issue with Crytivo internally. Instead of working with us to address the issue, Crytivo went to Valve and authorised them to remove Roots of Pacha from Steam without our knowledge or consent.

"PSA - We're in the process of rolling out a server side hotfix buff to Necro skellies," he added earlier today (thanks, GamesRadar+).

That's according to industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who took to Twitter to reflect on Tears of the Kingdom's legacy both in relation to its predecessor Breath of the Wild, and the charts more generally. 

"Sometimes I wonder if a game can last a few months on the top 20 best-seller charts," he tweeted ahead of the game's release earlier this week.

Epic Games stopped short of confirming it outright, of course, but instead dropped a mysterious tweet and a 20-second video teaser that declares that "a new way to grab the Victory Royale is coming", inviting you to "rise through the ranks".

The real clue, however, is in that accompanying video; whilst short, it seems to take us through eight different ranks, seemingly starting at bronze and progressing through silver, gold and more until it goes all the way to… I don't know, super-duper-platinum or something.
