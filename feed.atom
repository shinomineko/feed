The intriguing list includes numerous upcoming games, some which are unannounced for PC and others which have not been formally announced at all. 
Nvidia has now acknowledged the leak as legitimate, but told Wccftech that titles were "speculative" and "used only for internal tracking and testing". "Inclusion on the list is neither confirmation or an announcement of any game."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darkest Dungeon 2, the long-awaited sequel to developer Red Hook Games' acclaimed gothic horror RPG, will be launching into early access via the Epic Games Store on 26th October.
The original Darkest Dungeon was also borne of early access, having launched on Steam back in 2015. The resulting pre-release refinements ultimately helped make an already fantastic game even better, and Darkest Dungeon's punishing blend of dungeon crawling and visceral turn-based battling - in which your team of four misfits is at perpetual risk of unraveling in the face of multitudinous Lovecraftian horrors - released to significant critical acclaim.
"This is a game that's horrid in a way that means that you can't look away," wrote Christian Donlan in his Recommended review back in 2016, "a game of exhaustion and luridness and of terrible things happening in an awful, awful place. In other words, it's just lovely."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake won't just be gaining a few things in his upcoming remaster (a nicer face, for instance), he'll be losing a few things too, specifically in the form of all that product placement infamously infesting the original version of developer Remedy's cult-classic horror game.
Alan Wake's decidedly unsubtle attempts at paid product placement came in for some considerable criticism when it released back in 2010. The otherwise picturesque town of Bright Falls, which serves as the backdrop to Remedy's adventure, was, for instance, littered with billboards for US phone service provider Verizon, and Wake's supernaturally imbued flashlight seemed unusually fussy when it came to matters of evil-fighting, making exclusive use of Energizer batteries - meaning thousands of the brazenly branded buggers littered every nook, shelf, and unlikely hidey-hole throughout the game.
And it didn't end there; Bright Falls' spooky streets and forest-lined roads played host to vehicles manufactured by Ford and Lincoln, and Microsoft, which published the original Alan Wake, even managed to squeeze a few of its products in too.

WarioWare: Get It Together arrives as part of Tetris 99's latest limited-time Grand Prix event - the 24th to be held since the game's launch back in 2019 - with proceedings getting underway this Friday, 17th September and concluding next Monday, 20th September.
Usual rules apply for this one, meaning players will be awarded points for each round of Tetris 99 played online during the event, with the exact takeaway depending on their position at the end of a game.

According to GAME's announcement tweet, the stock refresh will include both disc and digital editions of PlayStation 5 - usually retailing for £449.99 and £359.99 respectively - alongside a currently unspecified selection of bundles, with everything due to go on sale via its website at the equally non-specific time of tomorrow "morning".
An online queuing system will once again be in place for those trying to order through GAME's website to accommodate the significant amount of traffic expected, and, as the retailer puts it, to make the process "as smooth and fair as possible for our customers".

There are a few eyebrow raisers in here, but let's start at the top and with Cristiano Ronaldo, who has been downgraded one point in overall score.
Ronaldo was rated 92 overall in last year's game, and second only to Lionel Messi's 93. For FIFA 22, however, Ronaldo has a 91 overall rating, and is booted into joint third alongside the likes of Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar of Paris Saint-Germain, and Atletico de Madrid keeper Jan Oblak.

Wester admitted to the incident in a series of messages posted to Twitter this morning, following last week's leak of a damaging union-led employee survey that revealed widespread "mistreatment" at the studio, such as "bullying and gender discrimination".
Wester does not detail the exact nature of the incident he is admitting to, though says he wants to acknowledge it now "in the name of transparency and clarity". When approached for more information by Eurogamer, a Paradox spokesperson declined to share more "out of respect for the privacy of the person involved".

Last Friday's ruling was a mixed result for both companies, though Epic lost the majority of the points it had tried to raise. 
Late on Friday night, Epic boss Tim Sweeney offered his thoughts on Twitter, and said the judgement "isn't a win for developers or consumers". In a series of messages, Sweeney said Epic would "fight on", and later categorised the result as a loss.

Among Us Arena, by game creator starcutter, is a 2D fighting game with the characters from the original but many mechanics fighting game fans will find familiar. The video below, from YouTuber Cookietriangle, provides a good idea of what it's like:

Officially, Nintendo does not set hardware pricing in Europe - but the new £259.99 price mark for the console listed on the company's official web store is seen by Nintendo as "appropriate" and a "guide" retailers will now likely follow.
"Nintendo of Europe is changing the European trade price of the Nintendo Switch console to retailers," a company spokesperson told Eurogamer this morning. "More than four and a half years after its first release, Nintendo Switch continues to have strong sales momentum in Europe. After carefully weighing up a variety of factors, including currency exchange rates in Europe and the upcoming launch of Nintendo Switch - OLED Model, we decided that now was the appropriate time to change the European trade price of Nintendo Switch.

Medvedev, who defeated World number one Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-4 6-4 in the grand final last night, threw himself to the court floor, lying on his side with his tongue hanging out.
The audience would be forgiven for not having a clue that Medvedev was performing a celebration from a video game (it sort of looks like he's collapsing with exhaustion), but in his post-match interview he confirmed what he was going for, saying: "Only legends will understand what I did after the match is L2 plus left.

Last month's release of Kubernetes v1.22 introduced a new ReadWriteOncePod access mode for PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.
With this alpha feature, Kubernetes allows you to restrict volume access to a single pod in the cluster.
What are access modes and why are they important?
When using storage, there are different ways to model how that storage is consumed.
For example, a storage system like a network file share can have many users all reading and writing data simultaneously.
In other cases maybe everyone is allowed to read data but not write it.
For highly sensitive data, maybe only one user is allowed to read and write data but nobody else.
In the world of Kubernetes, access modes are the way you can define how durable storage is consumed.

"Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet have been Chinese territories since ancient times. No matter how the obsolete think, they will eventually return to the mainland," says one such negative review, as translated by PC Gamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Non-league side Wrexham were rumoured to be in FIFA 22 for months before EA confirmed their addition yesterday via a list of all the teams in the game.
Now, though, Wrexham are no longer on the list - and EA hasn't said why.
Wrexham were set to become the first non-league team included in FIFA after EA published the list yesterday. Wrexham was listed as one of FIFA 22's Rest of the World teams (FIFA 22 includes the top four tiers of English football by default).

The images appeared via an anonymous Imgur post - now deleted - and are reportedly from a playtest. But, as you'd expect, the internet picked up the images and they are being widely shared on social media.
Redfall was announced in June as an Xbox Series X and S and PC game, with no mention of Xbox One. As a Bethesda-owned title, it'll launch on Xbox Game Pass day one summer 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a successful streamer strike earlier this month in protest of Twitch's continued failure to adequately tackle the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of hate raiding, the company has filed a lawsuit against two individuals it has identified as persistent offenders.
Twitch's raid feature was originally designed as a positive community tool, enabling streamers to redirect all viewers currently watching their broadcast to a target channel as an "easy way to share audiences". However, malicious users quickly began exploiting the feature, setting up scores of dummy accounts and bots to flood other, often marginalised, streamers in order to dox, harass, and attack them while they work.
While Twitch has previously conceded it needs to "do more to address these issues", the phenomenon has become so widespread in recent times that streamers organised a one-day strike early this month to protest a perceived lack of meaningful action by the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far Cry 6 is heading to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 7th October and, as is the modern way, Ubisoft is preparing a healthy dose of post-launch content, some free and some paid, which the publisher has now detailed in its newly revealed post-launch DLC road map - including surprise appearances from Rambo, Stranger Things, and actor Danny Trejo.
Those perhaps unlikely additions (Ubisoft hasn't yet detailed how it'll squeeze them into its broader Far Cry universe) will arrive across three free crossover missions, with other free post-launch offerings including Weekly Insurgencies and six Special Operations.
Insurgencies, available after completing the main campaign, let players earn new gear upgrades by tracking down and eliminating a new target somewhere on the island of Yara every seven days. Special Operations, meanwhile, challenge players to snatch highly unstable chemical weapons from arms dealers in unique new areas around the world and reach the extraction point before they overheat. Two Special Operations - Mesozoico and Maceo - will be available at launch with four more to follow. All this can be played solo or in two-player co-op.

However, Gonzalez-Rogers also decided Apple could not block developers linking out to alternative payment methods from within apps, as that would constitute "anti-competitive conduct" under state law.

The new legislation, due to take effect in South Korea next week, will see app store providers forced to allow developers to take payment directly - the issue that got Fortnite kicked off the app store in the first place.

Following its absence in the online-focussed - and quite brilliant - Gran Turismo Sport, the career mode returns in full-blooded fashion for the first numbered entry in the series since 2013. 
There's a compact World Map that hosts the many distractions of the career mode, including a licence centre where the series' infamous licence tests make their return, a tuning shop where players can pick up new parts to mod their cars - including licensed parts such as brake pads from Brembo - and a user car section where players can pick up pre-loved classics. It looks like all the fun of an evening spent browsing Pistonheads but in video game form!

Next up, we saw Project Eve, a kind of Bayonetta-looking action game that takes place in the not-too-distant future on a ruined Earth against unknown enemies.

There's quite a lot going on in the trailer, and fans of 2018's superb God of War will spot plenty of connective tissue between it and the upcoming sequel. Atreus is still searching for answers following the previous game's big reveal, for instance, and a whole heap of returning characters put in an appearance.
A still-very-pissed-off Freya is back - in its accompanying blog post, Sony says she's one of the main antagonists in Ragnarok, alongside Thor - as is the ever-sassy Mimir.

There's not a huge amount to report as far as Spider-Man 2 goes just yet, but Sony's newly revealed cinematic trailer does offer a few tantalising teases of things to come. For starters, it looks like we'll be getting a double helping of Spidey in the numbered sequel, with both Miles Morales and Peter Parker joining forces to battle against Venom.
Insomnic's original crack at Spider-Man, released in 2018, bought bags of web-swinging fun to the gorgeously realised streets of Manhattan, and its 2020 standalone expansion, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, was equally sharp, meaning expectations will be high for this sequel.

In Forspoken's previous showing, we got to see Frey evading a dragon, but Square's latest trailer is considerably more revealing, showcasing a blend of combat, narrative moments, and some splendidly acrobatic traversal across a breathtaking world. Oh, and a talking bracelet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is reportedly reviving its brash vehicular combat series Twisted Metal to coincide with the launch of its previously announced television adaptation.
The news comes via GamesBeat journalist Jeff Grubb who, as spotted by VGC, discussed development of a new Twisted Metal title during the latest Giant Bomb video show. According to Grubb, the new instalment represents a "broadening" of Sony's first-party games strategy as it seeks to align releases with its numerous movie and television projects.
Sony initially revealed it would be adapting Twisted Metal for television back in 2019, but it wasn't until earlier this year that first details were revealed. The project, an action comedy penned by Cobra Kai writer Michael Jonathan Smith, follows the adventures of a motor-mouthed outsider who's offered a chance at a better life - as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World War Z, the enormously popular co-operative zombie shooter from developer Saber Interactive, will finally be making its way to Switch on 2nd November.
World War Z initially launched for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox back in 2019, where its chaotic third-person zombie slaughter - reminiscent of Valve's seminal Left 4 Dead series - quickly found a legion of fans, selling over one million copies in the first week alone. Since then, Saber has built on World War Z's schlocky, solid core with a heap of post-launch content.
Most of this will be making its way to the Switch edition of World War Z at launch, meaning purchasers will be able to enjoy new modes, weapons, zombies types, and a seventh character class, Dronemaster, alongside the base game.

The video below leans pretty heavily on Xbox Game Pass and the upcoming Halo Infinite. A woman explores Windows 11, taps on the Game Pass icon, and is whisked off to some mystery desert.
There, a Covenant Banshee swoops into view. Thankfully, Master Chief turns up in a Warthog, jumps out and blows the Banshee to hell with a rocket launcher missile.

Speaking on the Kiwi Talkz podcast (thanks, IGN), former senior game designer Mike Wikan recalled occasions back in 2002 where he had just one hour of sleep over a 48-hour shift.

Hirofumi Kurita, who's been part of the show since its 2014 debut, returns as conductor, and Capcom says this year's music selection from across the Monster Hunter series will be augmented by tracks from this year's steller Monster Hunter Rise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been some 27 years since Little Big Adventure first delighted audiences with its colourful isometric escapades, but developer Adeline Software's much-loved action-adventure series is seemingly set to make a return in a new game developed by studio 2.21 under the watchful eyes of its original creators, Frédérick Raynal and Didier Chanfray.
The original Little Big Adventure - which served up a thoroughly charming blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration as it charted the story of young hero Twinsen, on the run from evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994, and the (at that point, slightly bigger) adventure continued in a sequel three years later.
It has, then, been quite a wait for fans hoping for a third instalment in the series, but their patience may have finally paid off. "For years, you have been waiting for a new Little Big Adventure," developer 2.21 wrote in a tweet shared earlier today. "Your wait it almost over. Thanks to the loving support of Frédérick Raynal and Didier Chanfray, we launched a new studio to bring Twinsen and Zoe back to PC and consoles."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aliens: Fireteam Elite, developer Cold Iron's solid co-op shooter spin on the classic movie franchise, has just launched its first seasonal content update on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, introducing, among other things, the brand-new Phalanx class.
The Phalanx class, which will be available free to all players, comes equipped with a collapsible shield that effectively turns them into a mobile bunker. The trade-off, however, is that Phalanx players must rely on one-handed weapons (the other hand obviously being busy with that massive shield), and so the class comes armed with a handgun and CQW.
Phalanx players also have access to a Shock Pulse ability that can be fired point-blank to disrupt swarming opponents, alongside 15 kit-specific perks, all obtainable through gameplay.

Previously known as Audacity Esports, and briefly playing under the temporary name Team JLE, Lingard's team is now officially titled JLINGZ esports, taking on the moniker of his personal brand. The side will compete next year in the Rainbow Six Siege UKIN Second Division, with the ambition to "create a legacy within Rainbow Six Siege as well as qualify for the 2022 European Challenger League".
Ahead of the official unveiling we talked to Lingard about his decision to buy the team. "Well I've always been a big gamer," he said. "You know, I think esports is only going to grow bigger than what it is now. I've had various conversations with Ubisoft - they've been brilliant with me - and I just thought it was the right time to get into esports and own my own team. And I think taking another jump into something different is going to be good - I always like trying new things."

The video, below, shows off combat and the hub area from Firaxis' upcoming strategy game, which is developed by the XCOM team.
Like XCOM's combat, Midnight Suns' combat is turn-based. But there are some key differences: the perspective is lower down and closer to the action, and movement is freeform, as opposed to playing out on a grid.

This alien concept ship will be leaving the pledge store on Monday..." The email did not mention the Gatac Railen does not exist yet in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an exciting week for Apple Arcade. Two words to write on the calendar for Friday: Zookeeper World. Maybe underline them too.
Zoo Keeper is the legendary web game from Robot Communications that turns match-three into an animal-tending classic with a surprising bolt of pathos thrown in when you least expect it. It was - I think - a DS launch game too, its bold colourful design showing off those little screens at their very best. It's since come to various platforms. Hooray!
Zookeeper World, developed by Kiteretsu, will offer Cel-shaded graphics as far as I can tell, and a sort of meta-mode where you're running your own zoo and keeping it stocked with delightful animals. Pathos yet to be confirmed. I am going to lose hours to this game. Maybe weeks and months and years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has warned Rainbow Six Siege AFK abuse "will be sanctioned".
The developer said it had noticed the "rising issue" of players abusing AFK methods in recent weeks, which it said had disrupted play in the competitive online shooter.
Last night, Ubisoft issued a wave of manual sanctions as it confirmed it was "evaluating design changes" to address the problem. Meanwhile, it's adding new automatic AFK detections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite developer 343 has tweaked the game's radar so it feels more like the motion tracker seen in previous Halo titles.
Infinite's combat sensor sparked a debate within the Halo community after it made its debut during the recent technical preview.
The combat sensor is the radar that sits in the bottom-left of your HUD. In the classic Halo games, the radar shows all movement except crouch-walking. But Halo Infinite's radar worked differently - it only displayed enemies when they were sprinting or shooting - a change that made it similar to Halo 5's Threat Tracker.

        <updated>2021-09-04T05:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of The Sims 4's earliest expansions, 2015's Spa Day, is getting a refresh next week, introducing a whole range of new features and improvements that'll be free to existing owners.
The original Spa Day (one of EA's mid-tier Game Packs, sitting between the smaller-scale Stuff Packs and more substantial Expansion Packs) brought a focus on health and relaxation to the Sims 4, adding the new spa building type where visiting Sims could de-stress and re-energise, enjoying everything from steam baths and stone massages to yoga and meditation.
As outlined in developer Maxis' latest livestream, next week's surprisingly expansive update to Spa Day will bring new features and tighter integration with the core game. There's a new High Maintenance trait, for instance, which can be soothed by a day at the spa, giving a little more impetus to use the facilities. Meanwhile, the old Wellness skill has now been expanded so that child Sims can take advantage of its calming benefits by participating in yoga and meditation (while wearing some new activity appropriate clothing, no less).

Prologue started life at Krafton's Amsterdam-based PUBG Special Projects, and will continue to be developed at Greene's new studio PlayerUnknown Productions, with Krafton investing in the new company with a minority stake.
Setting the scene for Prologue in a new video shared on Twitter, Greene explained, "I've held this deep fascination with sandbox-style open-world games and the freedom they give their players but I always just wished they were a bit bigger, so that's our mission as a studio - we want to create realistic sandbox worlds on a scale that's seldom attempted."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in July, reports began circulating that the beta of Amazon's MMO New World was bricking pricey EVGA-manufactured RTX 3090 graphics cards. A subsequent statement from Amazon insisted the beta was "safe to play", and it looks like it were right - EVGA has now investigated the issue, revealing the hardware failures were the result of dodgy soldering.
When reports of card failures began to surface, some users speculated the problem was due to power spikes and overheating caused by uncapped framerates in the New World beta's menus. While Amazon set about capping the framerate as a precautionary measure, EVGA began replacing affected cards and investigating returns to find out exactly what was going on.
Sharing its findings with PC World, EVGA has now revealed that while it wasn't able to replicate the issue using a copy of the New World beta, under X-ray analysis the less-than-two-dozen impacted RTX 3090s it received - all originating from an early 2020 production run - displayed "poor workmanship" on the soldering around the MOSFET circuits that powered the cards.

What's so significant about this particular project is that it's built on completely reverse engineered source code of Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. It's also been ported over to the Nintendo Switch, Playstation Vita and Nintendo Wii U.
Under US law, reverse engineering is generally legal. To further minimise encroachment of the law, the developers avoided using any leaked source code, and any copyrighted assets such as music, dialogue and images. Rather, players need to own the original game in order to get those assets.

In distributed systems, it can be hard to figure out where problems are. You grep through one component's logs just to discover that the source of your problem is in another component.  You search there only to discover that you need to enable debug logs to figure out what really went wrong... And it goes on. The more complex the path your request takes, the harder it is to answer questions about where it went.  I've personally spent many hours doing this dance with a variety of Kubernetes components. Distributed tracing is a tool which is designed to help in these situations, and the Kubernetes API Server is, perhaps, the most important Kubernetes component to be able to debug.

Beyond a Steel Sky, which initially released for iOS and PC last summer, reunites designer Charles Cecil and art director Dave Gibbons - the duo responsible for the first game - for another bout of dystopian sci-fi adventure.
This time around, returning protagonist Robert Foster plots a course for Union City - a fortified utopia in a war-ravaged world, where "people live happily under the surveillance and control of a benign AI" - in search of an abducted child.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just one day after announcing players will be able to shove Hello Kitty into a Monkey Ball following the release of Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania next month, Sega has revealed another post-launch DLC character for its simian-rolling platformer: Monster Rancher's Suezo.
For those previously unfamiliar with Koei Tecmo's long-running Monster Rancher series (and I count myself in that number), its blend of sim-like creature-rearing and battling originally debuted on PlayStation back in 1997, meaning next year marks its 25th anniversary.
Koei Tecmo previously revealed it's releasing versions of the first two Monster Rancher games on Switch in the west this December as part of the series' birthday celebrations (the first time Monster Rancher has travelled west in over a decade), but we now know those anniversary festivities will also extend to shoving one of the games' most iconic monsters - yellow one-eyed worm-thing Suezo - into a Monkey Ball too.

Specifics are somewhat limited at the moment - Mojang's announcement doesn't amount to much beyond a 'save the date' - but the developer is teasing appearances from "new and familiar faces" within the studio and Minecraft community for "in-depth interviews, exciting reveals, a nail-biting vote, and puns galore".
Last year's show saw the announcement of Minecraft's massive Caves & Cliffs update (which has since been split into two more manageable development chunks), and gave fans the opportunity to vote on the Minecraft Dungeons or Minecraft Earth mob they wanted to see introduced to the main game - with the exotic Glow Squid ultimately being the oceanic victor.

2007's original Crysis got the remaster treatment last Autumn, bringing various tweaks and enhancements for modern-era machines, and 15th October will see the game's two sequels - or, more specifically, their single-player campaigns - getting a similarly thorough spruce-up.
Crytek promises improved lighting, high-definition textures, plus visually enhanced characters, weapons, and environments, with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S running the games between 1080p and 4K at 60fps using Dynamic resolution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday's planned #ADayOffTwitch protest appears to have made an impact on the platform's overall viewer totals, as users aimed to make their voices heard to support marginalised streamers who regularly face hate speech and coordinated attacks from bigots on their channels. 
Stats site Twitchtracker shows around a million fewer viewers were tuned into the streaming giant during its daily peak yesterday, when the platform's average peak of 4.5 million concurrent viewers sat at around 3.5 million instead.
Many streamers voiced their support for the protest yesterday, although there was squabbling among some channels which did continue to broadcast for various reasons, including some seemingly taking advantage of big names being offline.

Earlier this week, Niantic dramatically U-turned on players' main sticking point - the removal of increased interaction radius in the game implemented at the start of the pandemic. Now, it has promised further changes in how it interacts with fans. 
"We've been listening to player feedback and also set up four roundtable conversations where I spoke with over 30 community leaders from around the world (thank you all for your participation!)" the game's executive producer Steve Wang wrote.  "The two main themes we heard were: The 80m interaction radius for PokéStops and Gyms has been an incredibly positive quality of life improvement over the past year and a half.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt has told investors it "can't say with full certainty" that its highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 next-gen updates will launch this year, despite the developer insisting it's still aiming for a "late 2021" release.
An enhanced edition of The Witcher 3 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S - promising the likes of ray-tracing and faster loader times - was announced last September, while a "proper" next-gen version of Cyberpunk 2077 was touted in June 2020.
Both were initially scheduled for launch this year, but the status of each has been somewhat unclear in light of Cyberpunk 2077's disastrous launch and the resulting studio reshuffle and revised development roadmap as CD Projekt worked to improve the base game.

        <updated>2021-09-01T20:32:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been curious about XCOM developer Firaxis' foray into superhero-themed strategy following the formal unveiling of Marvel's Midnight Suns last month, some of your questions may now have answers, courtesy of an official first look at the game in action.
Marvel's Midnight Suns takes inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s, which told the story of a band of supernatural superheroes as they battled against Lilith, Mother of All Demons. In Firaxis' game, Lilith has been resurrected by Hydra and will stop at nothing to fulfil a prophecy and bring back her master using the full force of her demonic army. In response to this hellish threat, the Caretaker chooses to reform the Midnight Sons with a few new heroes in tow - including the Avengers, who decide to revive legendary hero The Hunter, the child of Lilith and the only one known to have defeated her before.
That's the basic premise of Midnight Suns, with the ensuing action - which promises a "deeply customisable tactical battle system that rewards clever thinking with superhero flair" - sounding like a blend of card-battling turn-based combat and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Impostor Factory, the third game in developer Freebird Games' well-received To the Moon series, will be making its way to Steam on 30th September.
Described as a "bonkers time-loop tragicomedy murder mystery thriller featuring multiple casualties and a suspicious cat", Impostor Factory is designed as a completely standalone adventure (albeit one slotting somewhere within the series' timeline), requiring no knowledge of 2011's lo-fi tearjerker To the Moon or its first proper sequel Finding Paradise.
This time around, the focus is on a man named Quincy who accepts an invitation to a "suspiciously secluded" mansion, only to discover a time machine in its bathroom. "But of course, then people start dying," explains Freebird on Impostor Factory's Steam page. "And somewhere along the way, things get a little Lovecraftian and tentacles are involved."

Players can now stumble across procedurally generated Mos-Eisley-like settlements while exploring inhabited planets around the galaxy, each featuring unique buildings, neighbourhood layouts, colour schemes, and interior and exterior decorations.
Intriguingly, settlements serve as more than just points of interest for roving space tourists; players can agree to become the overseer of an ungoverned settlement, whereupon they'll be placed in charge of everything from town planning and treasury management to policy making and conflict resolution, even defending from enemy attacks when required.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A detailed Proof Games report into Mark Haspel, the co-founder of game grading company Wata, has brought to light worrying details of his business activities, and of Wata in general. 
Wata appraises and rates the quality of collectible video games, often pushing their prices into the hundreds and thousands of dollars. To avoid any conflict of interest, it has previously stated it does not allow employees to have their own games graded or sell any that have been graded by the company. 
But, this week, Proof Games' Seth Abramson discovered he had apparently bought several WATA-graded video games from an eBay seller that turned out to be Haspel. One of his purchases reportedly included a yellow sticky note that invited Abramson to email Haspel privately "for more games".

Surviving Mars - which challenges players to rejuvenate the wastes of the red planet, transforming it into a thriving colony of shimmering domes - was well-received when it launched in 2018. A selection of DLC followed, but Below and Beyond will be the game's first major expansion since 2019's Green Planet. A free tourism update released earlier this year.
Below & Beyond, as its name implies, takes the colony builder to new locales, going below Mars' surface and beyond its horizon so that players may turn their attention to building underground bases, mining asteroids, and gathering rare resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space fans have been treated to a very early look at EA's highly anticipated remake of the sci-fi horror favourite as part of an "unorthodox" new livestream - and while the project is still "really, really far from being done", according to developer EA Motive, the included new footage and details might be enough to keep interest piqued until more is ready to be revealed.
EA Motive's decision to show off its Dead Space remake so early in development is, by its own admission, a "bit unorthodox" for EA, but it says it wants "to be open with the communication" in order gather feedback on the direction it's taking.
To that end, the developer has shared a few early details - and, in some cases, glimpses - of the remake, beginning with a look at its initial efforts to enhance the original Dead Space's visuals for the modern era. As shown during the livestream, this involved the art team revisiting the 2008 game's legacy assets, adding details to existing geometry, applying shaders, materials, and VFX, plus a first pass at lighting to get the mood right. The results, as you'll see if you hop through the livestream below, are certainly striking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town, the latest entry in developer Marvelous Inc's much-loved farm-life series, is making the jump from Switch to PC on 15th September.
Pioneers of Olive Town, sticking firmly to the well-worn Story of Seasons template, casts players as a newcomer to a peaceful community after they inherit the local farm from their grandfather. The usual formula of busily compulsive seasonal crop-growing and animal-rearing follows, with players once again free explore the nearby village and befriend the local in their downtime.
This latest instalment in the series initially launched on Switch back in March, where it received rather mixed reviews - with critics calling out some wonky performance, a disappointingly lifeless cast of townsfolk, and some questionable design decisions, such as a bizarre over-reliance on fussily implemented Maker machines to get things done.

To presumably celebrate the game's genuinely very enjoyable alien season, you can now purchase Will Smith in Fortnite.  The only downside? He's called Mike Lowery, and this is Will Smith's character from the decidedly non-alien focused Bad Boys trilogy.
Digital rights weirdness aside, Smith's arrival in Fortnite comes after a series of high profile stars arrived via the game's Icon Series as themselves: Ariana Grande, J Balvin and LeBron James.

Ben Swartzlander (NetApp)
Kubernetes v1.22, released earlier this month, introduced a redesigned approach for volume
populators. Originally implemented
in v1.18, the API suffered from backwards compatibility issues. Kubernetes v1.22 includes a new API
field called dataSourceRef that fixes these problems.
Data sources
Earlier Kubernetes releases already added a dataSource field into the
PersistentVolumeClaim API,
used for cloning volumes and creating volumes from snapshots. You could use the dataSource field when
creating a new PVC, referencing either an existing PVC or a VolumeSnapshot in the same namespace.
That also modified the normal provisioning process so that instead of yielding an empty volume, the
new PVC contained the same data as either the cloned PVC or the cloned Volu…]]></summary>

As spotted by Siliconera, the statue - released to honour the franchise's 20th anniversary - is a three-dimensional, "real-life quality" vision of Dante. It's expected to ship between November 2022 and February 2023, and the hefty cover price does not include shipping or customs/import tax fees. 
Created by Prime1 studio, the 43-inch tall, pint-sized Dante boasts artificial hair - which includes an alternate silicon head - a silicon body for that, uh, "lifelike" skin, and a full outfit, including his iconic red leather coat. Each one will be hand-finished, so prospective buyers are told to expect some "individual differences" between models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fall Guys, Mediatonic's knockabout battle royale game, has reintroduced its "No Teams" playlist for players who prefer to go solo than duke it out as a team.
The change comes because of "unprecedented" complaints from players who are frustrated by rounds that require teamwork, presumably because - and I know this from personal experience - there's a small but pervasive underclass of players that thinks it's funny to mess about and throw the round.
"There has been unprecedented complaints regarding levels in which you compete as part of a unit," reports Beanbot on the game's hugely popular Twitter account. "Duly, we have reinstated a playlist called 'No Teams'.

Confirmation came way of a tweet from the Destiny 2 studio, which acknowledged the armour permitted Hunters to dodge "an unintended amount of times", including during competitive matches in its Gambit and Crucible playlists.
"Due to an issue that allows Hunters to dodge an unintended amount of times in a row, we have temporarily disabled the Radiant Dance Machines Exotic Hunter leg armor in Gambit and all PvP activities," the studio said.

Though Reedus didn't give away too much in the Portuguese interview - and auto-translations can sometimes be inaccurate, meaning we can only take this as a rumour for now - IGN Brasil reports he said he "thinks" a second Death Stranding is on the way.
"I think we're doing a second Death Stranding," Reedus told AdoroCinema, which is a partner site of IGN Brasil. "[Death Stranding 2] is in negotiations right now. So... yay!" Reedus reportedly said to journalists at a recent The Walking Dead roundtable.

The information comes courtesy of the French forum Dealabs. Though forums can be unreliable given anyone can post just about anything, in this instance poster Billbil-kun was asked to verify the rumour - something they reportedly did to the moderation's team's satisfaction, which is why the post has not been removed (thanks, VGC).
Overcooked! All You Can Eat features both Overcooked titles, Overcooked! and Overcooked! 2 in "stunning, enhanced 4K visuals", "blended together and remastered in this delicious definitive edition" on PS5 complete with extra add-on content.

Set in a struggling 1980s Canadian coastal town where people are afraid to fish, Moonglow Bay draws inspiration from the likes of Harvest Moon and Legend of the River King, aiming to "capture the magic of fishing and make it the heart of everything".
Players take on the role of a rookie angler trying to full their partner's last wish and keep their business afloat - a task Moonglow Bay thankfully pitches more toward relaxing village-life sim than soul-sapping struggle on the brink of destitution.

        <updated>2021-08-27T18:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blasphemous, developer The Game Kitchen's superb gothic action-platformer, is wrapping up its brooding redemption adventure on 9th December with the arrival of another free story expansion, titled Wounds of Eventide, plus there's a fully fledged sequel due in 2023.
Blasphemous, which released to well-deserved acclaim back in 2019, tells the story of The Penitent One, a pointy hatted fellow with a barbed-wire sword, forced to venture across the accursed kingdom of Cvstodia - a desolate, but lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness.
It's wonderful stuff, serving up an engaging blend of 2D Souls-like and Metroidvania bolstered by some fascinating world-building and gorgeously wrought, grimly unforgettable imagery. Needless to say, it was an absolute pleasure to return to Blasphemous the following year when The Game Kitchen continued The Penitent One's tale in its free The Stir of Dawn DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Truck Simulator is finally ready roll out to a brand-new destination, with its long-awaited Wyoming expansion now confirmed for release on 7th September.
Wyoming is the eighth state to be added to American Truck Simulator since its launch in 2016 - following developer SCS' increasingly lavish recreations of Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, and Colorado - and opens up myriad new routes for long-distance haulers and landscape fetishists to enjoy.
Wyoming will link up American Truck Simulator's previous Colorado, Idaho, and Utah expansions for more convenient cross-country trucking, just leaving a Montana-shaped gap at the very top of the game's map. Of course, we already know SCS' next destination is to the east, with the developer having confirmed it's hard at work capturing the vast sprawl of Texas for its next expansion release as it slowly ticks off all 50 states.

This means, for example, a game company who holds a user's email address could then contact that person to suggest they buy a season pass or in-game currency directly from them, rather than via the App Store where Apple takes its cut. 
Until now, Apple did not let developers use any contact information obtained from within an app to contact their users outside of the app. A class-action lawsuit said this was unfair, and blocked the ability for them to inform customers of cheaper purchase options (thanks, Ars Technica).

Kart Krash: Full Auto sees players fight to be the last one surviving in teams or chaotic free-for-alls, using the weapons attached to their go-karts and assorted power-ups scattered about the map to take their opponents out. It's a bit like Mario Kart's Battle Mode, except there's tanks and machine guns. 
Go-karts aren't new to the game, having arrived back in December with The Cayo Perico Heist. But the new game mode dedicates these vehicles to their own arena.

It promises to bring stable 60fps performance, private lobbies and updated liveries for the 2021 GT World Challenge series, and there'll be a free update path for owners of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to their respective next-gen upgrades. 
Assetto Corsa Competizione first came out on PC in 2018, with its sole purpose being to replicate the GT World Challenge series (the series formerly known as Blancpain GT), which sees the Spa 24 Hours as its centrepiece. The initial console port was decent if lacking in some areas - areas which this next gen update would seem to address.

If you weren't aware, Steam offers a refund for all game purchases, no questions asked, as long as your playtime is less than two hours and it's within two weeks of purchase. 
It's a ‌pro-consumer policy (or a cost-effective way to reduce the number of customer service staff, depending on who you ask), and the two-hour playtime threshold is intended to stop less trustworthy consumers from exploiting it.

This blog describes the notion of Availability for StatefulSet workloads, and a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.22 which adds minReadySeconds configuration for StatefulSets.
What problems does this solve?
Prior to Kubernetes 1.22 release, once a StatefulSet Pod is in the Ready state it is considered Available to receive traffic. For some of the StatefulSet workloads, it may not be the case. For example, a workload like Prometheus with multiple instances of Alertmanager, it should be considered Available only when Alertmanager's state transfer is complete, not when the Pod is in Ready state. Since minReadySeconds adds buffer, the state transfer may be complete before the Pod becomes Available. While this is not a fool proof way of…]]></summary>

Reports of Netflix's plans to enter the world of video games began to circulate in May, and the company finally made it official in July, saying it was "in the early stages of further expanding into games" and that it viewed gaming "as another new content category for us."
It also clarified it would initially focus on mobile games, with a later report suggesting the first batch of these titles would launch as part of Netflix's subscription service some time next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix's previously Switch-exclusive JRPG sequel Bravely Default 2 is making its way to Steam early next month, on 2nd September.
Bravely Default 2 - the follow-up to 3DS JRPGs Bravely Default and Bravely Second: End Layer, which released in 2012 and 2015 respectively - launched on Switch back in February this year, charting the adventures of a new band of heroes on the continent of Excillant.
Its story begins when young sailor Seth washes onto the shores of one of the continent's five regions. He eventually joins forces with Gloria - a princess forced to flee her own kingdom - alongside travelling scholar Elvis and the mercenary Adelle, for a familiar blend of narrative-driven exploration and turn-based combat built around the series' Brave/Default mechanic, which essentially lets players strategically bank turns to unleash in one massive blast later on.

Dying Light has been a massive success for Techland - the developer says the game has now been played by over 20 million players since its launch back in 2015 - and it's received an absolute stack of DLC, both free and paid, over the years as a result (and, of course, a sequel is due on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox this December).
All that DLC was bundled together for a special Platinum Edition of Dying Light on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox earlier in 2021, and it's this version that's now been confirmed to be making its way to Switch at some currently undisclosed future point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[September is almost upon us, meaning a fresh batch of Games With Gold titles to download for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, this time including Zone of the Enders HD Collection, Warhammer: Chaosbane, and more.
First out the gate is Zone of the Enders HD Collection for Xbox 360, which will be available as part of Games with Gold between 1st September and 15th September. Initially release in 2012 (where it was infamously so poor it ended up getting an extensive patch from an entirely different porting studio), it features high-definition remasters of the Hideo-Kojima-produced Zone of the Enders and Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner, each serving up a celebrated blend of mech-based third-person shooting and hack-and-slash action.
From 1st September to 15th September, Games with Gold subscribers can download Warhammer: Chaosbane, a Diablo-esque fantasy action-RPG set in the middle of Warhammer's Old World history. Players can take on the role of human, high elf, wood elf, or a dwarf as they batter their way through familiar locations - including the cursed city of Praag and Nuln, the old capital of the Empire - in their ceaseless quest for shiny loot. And who doesn't love loot?

The trailer also includes a hidden URL (scribbled on a piece of card visible at the 1:24 mark) which leads to a mock US military website full of extra lore details on House of Ashes' story.
The only downside to that trailer? A big ol' advert for the game's "Pazuzu Edition" comes right at the end, showing a highly-detailed figurine of the game's monster. The creature is something trailers have so far only teased, and while this isn't the first time this advert has been shown, it's still jarring to see it plonked at the end. Oh well.

Watson, who led the Saints Row 2 patch project at Volition, died yesterday after a long battle with cancer.
In May, Watson's illness caused him to step down from his position as Volition community manager, although he continued to work on the Saints Row 2 patch project.

Niantic announced the news last night to jubilation among fans and numerous high-profile figures in the game's community who had united in an unprecedented call for Niantic to rethink its plans to ditch the doubled distance in certain countries, after changes went live in the US and New Zealand. (The changes were then repealed in New Zealand after a new government-enforced lockdown.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sifu, the martial arts adventure from Absolver developer Sloclap, finally has a release date and will release for PlayStation and PC on 22nd February next year.
Sifu is a a third-person, single-player action game, focussed on "intense hand-to-hand combat", that follows a young Kung Fu student on a path of revenge as he hunts down his family's murderers with nothing but a mysterious pendant and, possibly, the ability to palm-smash someone's nose out the back of their head.
Actually that's not quite true; as players make their way through Sifu's world - "from the gang-ridden suburbs to the cold hallways of the corporate towers" - they're encouraged to use everything at their disposal to overcome the odds and hunt down their targets, whether that be throwable objects or makeshift weapons strewn around the environment.

Announced last summer, the moodily atmospheric Jett casts players as scout and 'anchorite' Mei as she becomes the first person to explore a mythic ocean planet in order to "carve out a future for a people haunted by oblivion" and search for something called "the hymnwave". 
"Skim low over waves, roar up pristine coastlines and carve through otherworldly woods," teases the developers. "Adapt to an intricate, systemic open world and persevere through adversity alongside an intimate ensemble cast in this story of courage, wonder and regret."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a succession over-the-top adventures that folded in alien invasions and superpowers with Saints Row 4 and its subsequent follow-ups, Volition is bringing its open world crime series back to its roots with the next year's Saints Row - a reboot that reintroduces a more grounded contemporary fictional setting while still looking to hold onto the humour and possibilities that Saints Row has become beloved for. 
Titled simply Saints Row, the new game will be a cross-generational affair that's coming as soon as next February, and sees a player-created character heading up a gang of four as they go on to establish a criminal empire. Among that group is Eli, a nerdy planner with an MBA, Neenah, who provides the driving talent and Kevin, who, er, has some lovely abs? Then there's the player character themselves, defined by the player using some of the same deep customisation options seen previously in the series - and the group's make-up promises to play into the co-op that is also at the heart of this Saints Row reboot. 
Providing the playground this time out is Santo Ileso, which draws heavily upon the American south west. It's broken down into nine distinct districts, including the downbeat Rancho Providencio, Las Vegas analogue El Dorado and the secluded suburban Monte Vista. In the heart of the city there's an extended emphasis on verticality (and the promise of some tools to make the most of all that, with wingsuits and ziplines that catapult players into the air).

Players familiar with the original 2018 game should be immediately at home with Evolution 2, which once again tasks budding managers with building and maintaining their own dinosaur theme park, laying out exhibits, tending to visitors needs, and, of course, making sure the attractions don't eat the guests.
It's not all business as usual though; Jurassic World Evolution 2 shifts the action away from the exclusively tropical setting of Muertes Archipelago, as seen in the first game, and gives players the chance to build their parks across a diverse range of new environments - from dense forests to scorched deserts - each with unique environmental challenges, including bespoke weather such as sandstorms and snow.

The Skywalker Saga, an all-new retelling of Lucasfilm's nine Star Wars films built in a new engine, was announced at E3 2019 for a late 2020 release. However, it's now seen two delays - the most recent in April this year - leaving many to wonder when it would finally resurface.
And the answer, of course, is today, with Opening Night Live serving up a fresh look at The Skywalker Saga in a brand-new trailer blending cutscenes and gameplay of familiar moments from right across the Star Wars nonology, all given a typically comedic Lego game twist.

I'm less impressed by its monsters - a collection of oddball creatures which in turn look like animals, robots or piñatas. It's also unclear exactly how battles will work - they look real-time, with items and weaponry seemingly summoned out of thin air.

So, what's it all about? Midnight Suns is set in the "darker side of the Marvel Universe", based on a '90s comic book series called Rise of the Midnight Sons - although apparently it's deliberately not an exact retelling of those events. The setup for the game is this: perpetual baddies Hydra have revived someone called Lilith, who does a bit of dead-raising that threatens to overrun the Avengers (Iron Man, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Dr. Strange, and Wolverine can be spotted in the trailer). The Avengers call up a few extra supernatural mates to help out, called the Midnight Suns, which includes Nico Minoru, Blade, Magik, and Ghost Rider, and a few more (12 Marvel heroes in total), and together they then resurrect some help of their own: one more hero, newly created for the game, called the Hunter, who's also Lilith's child and apparently the only one able to kill her.
The Hunter, who's customisable (in "appearance" and also in terms of a choice of about 40 different abilities), is who you'll be playing as, which is where things immediately depart from the XCOM formula. You'll be controlling both the Hunter and the other heroes in combat, with battles featuring three heroes total at a time, but then the time between battles is spent in one of two ways: managing your base, a mystical safehouse called the Abbey - so far so XCOM - or actually walking around the Abbey in third-person, over-the-shoulder view, exploring its "extensive" grounds and interacting with the other heroes.

Tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live trailer for the game showed off the game's new feline addition (though also stated his voiceover and background music aren't in the game). 
We also got a brief glimpse at the 12 party games included in Banana Blitz. (Don't worry, Target is of course there.) The full list includes Monkey Target, Baseball, Tennis, Racing, Fight, Bowling, Golf, Billiards, Soccer, Shot, Boat and Dogfighting.

"Humanity's forces are scattered. Desperate resistance efforts have continued to fall short on multiple fronts, from Cortana's relentless martial law to the expanding power and ambition of Atriox and the Banished.

Little Nightmares 2's Enhanced Edition aims to give the already richly atmospheric experience - which follows the adventures of new protagonist Mono and returning character Six through the grim streets of Pale City - an even moodier boost with a range of primarily visual enhancements.
There's ray-traced reflections, for starters, bringing live reflections to Little Nightmare's various shiny surfaces, as well as improved volumetric shadows - which, as publisher Bandai Namco explains in its announcement post, "add even more depth and detail to every object and enhance how rays of light are interrupted by moving objects".

These documents, California says, should have been kept pending its own legal investigation (thanks, Axios). 
The state has also criticised Activision Blizzard for enforcing NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) which have hampered staff efforts to speak out, and for involving third-party legal firm WilmerHale to investigate - something California says "directly interferes" with its own efforts.

I've already reported how the cyberpunk twin-stick shooter's latest patch negatively affected the Windows 10 version of the game, with stuttering, poor framerate and other technical struggles experienced by players.
I'm in the same boat. I'm playing The Ascent via Xbox Game Pass on PC, and therefore the Windows 10 version, and ever since the recently-released patch came out, it's been pretty much unplayable.

This blog post is about a new Kubernetes feature introduced in v1.22, which adds
an additional security layer on top of the existing seccomp support. Seccomp is
a security mechanism for Linux processes to filter system calls (syscalls) based
on a set of defined rules. Applying seccomp profiles to containerized workloads
is one of the key tasks when it comes to enhancing the security of the
application deployment. Developers, site reliability engineers and
infrastructure administrators have to work hand in hand to create, distribute
and maintain the profiles over the applications life-cycle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix's series of Final Fantasy pixel remasters continues on 8th September with the arrival of Final Fantasy 4 on Steam and mobile devices. 
"In Final Fantasy 4", explains Square, "The Kingdom of Baron sends their elite airship fleet, the Red Wings, to attack the surrounding countries. Distressed by his mission, Cecil, a dark knight and captain of the Red Wings, decides to fight against the tyrannical Baron with his trusted friend and his paramour at his side."
Final Fantasy 4's pixel remaster follows similar releases for the first three games, bringing updated 2D pixel character and background art, a rearranged soundtrack (overseen by original composer Nobuo Uematsu), improved gameplay, and a range of quality of life additions.

Sea of Thieves' newly announced Making Mayhem event is, as its name suggest, all about causing a ruckus out on the waves, challenging players to earn Favour with the Bilge Rats by completing a range of different (and largely explosion-focussed) activities. 
Minor Mayhem challenges give pirates the opportunity to earning a "fair" amount of Favour by doing things like detonating Gunpowder Skeletons in a chain reaction or destroying a Ghost Ship, while Major Mayhem challenges are considerably more lucrative. A "good" amount of Favour can be earned by opening one of the Gold Hoarders' Treasure Vaults, for instance, and other activities, such as completing a Tall Tale, reward a "huge" amount of Favour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Team17 and developer Drop Bear Bytes have joined forces to bring Australia-themed post-apocalyptic cRPG Broken Roads to Steam and consoles next year.
Broken Roads tasks players, and their accompanying party of up to five characters, with traversing a "content-rich and densely-crafted" post-apocalyptic future version of Western Australia, visiting real-life locations along the way. The experience is - as even a quick glance at the trailer below will confirm - heavily inspired by classic single-player cRPGs, and features a blend of turn-based tactical combat, alongside "traditional and original" RPG mechanics.
There's a "classless" character system, offering "nearly unlimited...development options", and something Drop Bear calls the Moral Compass. Acting as a kind of enhanced morality system, this sees dialogue options and questing decisions influence - and be influenced by - a character's philosophical leanings, with the game featuring four philosophical paths, each with their own unique traits.: Humanist, Utilitarian, Machiavellian, and Nihilist.

The show started with another look at Dying Light 2, and a sunset-drenched "modern dark ages" post-apocalypse full of parkour gameplay. Techland's long-awaited sequel arrives 7th December.
Next up was an extended look at Microsoft Flight Simulator with the chatty Jorg Neumann, who talked more about the game's upcoming sixth world update covering Germany, Austria and Switzerland which is due on 7th September.

The sequence sees the player air-dropped from a cargo plane, by parachute, in a series of signature cars, all over the game's Mexico map.
First up is a 2021 Ford Bronco Badlands, a rugged, retro-styled SUV that is dropped right next to a smouldering volcano crater, dusted with snow. It's winter up here, but a vertiginous descent takes us down into a baking desert and a brief glimpse of a Baja rallying circuit.

The console version is being developed in conjunction with Lab42 and promises to "utilise key capabilities" of the Xbox Series X/S and PS5, "like super-fast load times for a seamless gameplay experience".
"Xbox Series X/S players will be able to quickly switch between gameplay and consulting a YouTube tutorial on how to quell a peasant revolt," Paradox says in its announcement. "PlayStation 5 users will experience the game's stress mechanics themselves, as their DualSense controllers physically react to in-game events as they unfold."

That, however, is just the beginning, with the developer having now confirmed two new aircraft, plus a competitive multiplayer mode arriving this autumn.
World Update 6, as we already knew, arrives on 7th September and aims to drastically enhance Flight Simulator's rendition of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Alongside visual upgrades, it'll introduce around 100 famous handcrafted landmarks, four new airports - Lübeck, Stuttgart, Klagenfurt and St. Galle - plus new discovery flights, landing challenges, bush trips, and more.
That "and more" was elaborated on during tonight's Xbox Gamescom Showcase, and takes the form of a new pilotable plane: the Junkers JU-52. This 1930s German aircraft arrives as part of a new series of paid DLC Asobo is calling Local Legends, introducing new planes well-known in the local area of each World Update, but which are perhaps less well-known to a worldwide audience. The Junkers JU-52 arrives on 7th September and will cost $14.99 USD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced an indefinite delay to the physical release of Sonic Colours: Ultimate in Europe.
The holdup applies to both standard and keyring editions of the game - the latter of which includes a Baby Sonic keychain. Digital versions of the game are unaffected and arrive as planned on 7th September.
Sega blamed the delay on "unforeseen logistical issues", and said it would affect all EMEA markets excluding Australia and New Zealand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asterix and Obelix are readying for some fisticuffs in developer Mr Nutz Studio's striking 2D beat 'em up Asterix & Obelix: Slap them All!, which is now confirmed for a PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC release on 25th November.
Slap them All! unfolds in the Roman-occupied Gaul, circa 50 BC, where, as publisher Micriods puts it, "Only one small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders."
Those Gauls, of course, include Asterix and Obelix, who players will be able to control as they journey (either solo or with a friend via local co-op) across iconic locations from the comic books, battling Roman legionaries, pirates, brigands, "and even the dreaded Normans". The ensuring hand-animated adventure, as you'll see in the trailer below, looks glorious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Voxel vacation adventure (and Digital Foundry favourite) The Touryst - developed by Shin'en Multimedia, the team behind acclaimed Switch racer Fast RMX - is making its way to PlayStation on 9th September, according to a new listing on the PlayStation Store.
Details regarding the PlayStation version are limited - there's a release date and description and that's about it - but The Touryst (which debuted on Switch in 2019 before heading to Xbox and PC the following year) remains a fun little excursion, depositing players on the glorious Monument Islands holiday resort for a spot of sun, sea, and exploration-driven adventure.
On a basic level, the goal is to progress from island to island - all rendered with an appealing, retro-inspired voxel art style, and each with its own theme - in order to infiltrate the mysterious monuments strewn around and solve the mix of puzzles and platform challenges within.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive could soon be bringing its superb medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 to consoles according to a newly uncovered listing by the Taiwanese ratings board.
As spotted by Gematsu, three relevant listings (seemingly now removed) have found their way onto the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee's website; one for Crusader Kings 3 on PlayStation 5, one for the game on Xbox Series X/S, and another for Xbox One.
Of course, nothing is official until Paradox makes it so, but the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee has good form when it comes to leaking game announcements ahead of time, with everything from Crash Bandicoot 4 to last year BioShock ports for Switch having appeared on its website prior to their official unveilings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Odyssey players on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 will soon be able to hurtle across ancient Greece at 60fps, courtesy of a new game update releasing tomorrow, 24th August.
In its current form, Odyssey retains the 30fps limit seen on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro when playing on Sony and Microsoft's newest consoles via backward compatibility, meaning players are in for an extremely welcome 100% frame rate boost when the update arrives.
According to Ubisoft's announcement post, that'll happen at 7am tomorrow, 24th August, in the UK. Meanwhile, those that set their watches to Pacific Daylight Time won't have to roll into a new day - it's out tonight, 23rd August, at 11pm PDT.

It's a slightly odd announcement, given it mentions the players only, as opposed to having the league also officially licensed. Perhaps this means the MLS players will be free agents in the game.
The trailer, below, shows LA Galaxy's Jonathan Dos Santos expressing his delight at the news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final paychecks are now being sent to Kingdoms of Amalur staff members, nine years after developer 38 Studios was shut down. 
Company mismanagement and poor sales of the ambitious RPG meant 38 Studios collapsed shortly after it became clear Kingdoms of Amalur was not going to be a World of Warcraft-style hit.
This left nearly 400 developers adrift, and waiting for their final paycheck - until now. A new report from Bloomberg [paywall] states staff are now belatedly receiving their last pay packet - albeit just a fraction of what they were owed (thanks GamesIndustry.biz).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades is currently the best-rated game for PS5 and Xbox Series X on Metacritic.
Although the indie roguelike was only released for current-gen consoles last week, it's surpassed every single competitor released on the new consoles since they debuted back in 2020, securing a top aggregated Metacritic score of 94 on Xbox Series X and 93 on PS5. 
Given the hundreds of titles that have been released on PS5 and Xbox Series X thus far it's an incredible achievement, not least because for the former, Hades has secured an aggregate score higher than games like Demon's Souls (92) and Borderlands 3 (91). On Xbox, on the other hand, it's topped Ori and the Will of the Wisps (92) and Microsoft Flight Simulator (90) (thanks, TwistedVoxel).

Using the hashtag #ADayOffTwitch, the protesters hope that by refusing to log on and create - or even spectate - Twitch streams on 1st September, it'll hit the company's purse and compel it to listen, and better support, the creators who suffer regularly from "hate raids" and organised attacks. 
The idea for the boycott comes from Rek It Raven, LuciaEverBlack, and Shineypen (thanks, PC Gamer), and together, they're trying to convince other Twitch streamers and viewers to do the same.

It's just a strangely isolated, mournful, lonely game to play that has these incredible moments of violence and terror, with these weird, psychedelic concepts and villains.

In a brief tweet on the developer's official social media channels, Capcom said this update - the second in the developer's fight to stabilise the horror game on PC - fixes an issue where "certain" unspecified CPUs were "unable to launch the game", as well as the "minor fine-tuning of certain graphical processes", although what, exactly, graphical processes the update will address. 
A few weeks back, hackers hit the headlines by insisting that the stuttering and dropped framerates experienced by players on PC were caused by the game's own anti-piracy measures - something Digital Foundry was able to test and prove, too.

It's worth noting part one does not include the sinking of the Titanic. This is planned for a later release. Nor does it include a fully-fleshed out storyline, or the full interior of the ship itself.

The video below runs through the creation process, and it's fascinating stuff. With the help of some nifty programs and an AI-powered texture upscaler, Reubs was able to get game's map up and running in Unreal 5, as well as Homer, a few NPCs, collectibles, and even vehicles. There's ray tracing for that fancy lighting, too, and of course the Duff Blimp flying overhead.

Perhaps the headline change is the removal of scaling. In the base Cyberpunk, V and their enemies gain stats as you level up. This means, without any upgrades, V ends up much weaker than enemies at the level 50 cap than they are at level one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild, the promising PlayStation-exclusive open-world survival adventure from Wild Sheep Studio, is reportedly no longer in development.
Announced back in 2014 for release on PS4, Wild was due to be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment with Rayman and Beyond Good & Evil creator Michel Ancel at the helm - until the famed designer announced his retirement from the games industry in 2020.
Wild only properly surfaced one more time following its announcement - at Paris Games Week in 2015 - and gameplay details remain limited to his day. We do know, however, that players, in the role of a shaman, could possess and play as a variety of wild animals - including a bear, eagle, and snake - and call on the help of deities as they explored the vast, prehistoric world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of cult classic adventure series Syberia can soon reunite with protagonist Kate Walker on a brand-new adventure - this one "across continents and through time periods" - when a fourth instalment, The World Before, comes to PC on 10th September.
The original Syberia, if you're unfamiliar, released all the way back in 2002, quickly charming adventure game fans with its gently surreal story of a New York lawyer dispatched to deal with the sale of a former automaton factory hidden in the French Alps.
An equally well-regarded sequel followed two years later, but it took a further 15 years for Walker's adventures to continue. Unfortunately, 2017's Syberia 3 was generally considered to be a bit of a dud - plagued by technical problems and flawed design - leaving many to assume its poor reception would mark the end of the series.

Originally announced in June, Flight Simulator's sixth World Update - which follows similar enhancements for Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the United States - introduces new aerials and elevation maps for Germany, Austria, and Germany, alongside new photogrammetry cities, four hand-crafted airports, and nearly 100 points of interest.
Previous reveals from developer Asobo have confirmed three of those airports - Klagenfurt Airport (LOWK)
Lübeck Airport (EDHL), and St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport (LSZR) - plus a number of new landmarks, including Castle Marienburg in Hanover, Holstentor in Lübeck, Deutches Eck in Koblenz, Castle Katz in St. Goarshausen, Munich's Allianz Arena, and the Riesenrad in Vienna.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a little over two years since publisher THQ Nordic announced a new Saints Row title was "deep in development" at series studio Volition, and finally it seems the silence around the game is about to be broken, if a tantalising new tease is anything to go by.
The tease in question comes courtesy of noted presenter and producer Geoff Keighley, who shared some intriguing art on Twitter earlier today - featuring a heavily graffitied wall adorned with the word 'Rebooting' and, crucially, the Saints' beloved fleur-de-lis emblem.
The same image has now appeared on the official Saints Row Twitter feed and website - just in case their were any lingering doubts about its connection to the series - meaning the only real question left to ask at this juncture regarding what would be the first numbered Saints Row title to release since 2015 is, 'When will we learn more?'.

Spanish La Liga club Real Betis announced the signing of Argentinian defender Germán Pezzella with a video called GTA 4: Real Betis Edition.
In the video, striker Aitor Rubial walks to the club's stadium, the Estadio Benito Villamarín, with the camera aping the GTA perspective, and with a walk befitting Niko Bellic himself. The music is a good fit, and there's even a GTA-style user interface, complete with mini-map.

Developer 343 used the recent Halo Infinite technical preview to gather feedback on bot behaviour and online performance. To that end, the technical preview debuted with the Bot Arena playlist, which put four players against four bots on arena maps.
As 343 pushed the bot difficulty lever over the course of the technical preview weekend, the AI became more deadly. These bots were accurate, aggressive and ruthless. They would come in for a well-timed melee hit after dropping your shield. They would dodge grenades. They used grenades well and often. They picked up power weapons and they were not afraid to use them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch-owning fans of demon murder (who somehow still haven't played id Software's legendary Doom saga) are in luck; as part of this year's QuakeCon, id has announced a five-game Doom Slayers Collection for Nintendo's console, which is available to purchase now.
The reveal isn't too much of a surprise - US retailer Best Buy successfully managed to leak the Doom Slayers Collection for Switch earlier today ahead of its official reveal - but the game's immediate post-announcement launch most certainly was, and Switch players can now enjoy some demon-hued FPS japes all in one bundle, featuring seminal 1993 original Doom, Doom 2, Doom 64, Doom 3, and 2016's sort-of-rebooted Doom.
Notably, that's one more game than was featured in the Doom Slayers Collection for Xbox and PlayStation, which released toward the end of last year minus Doom 64 - a pleasant treat for Switch owners, based on Digital Foundry's previous enthusiasm for the port.

Announced during QuakeCon's Skyrim panel, the Anniversary Edition arrives on 11th November - exactly ten years after the launch of the original version - and bundles together 2016's Skyrim Special Edition and a healthy chunk of additional content.
Specifically, it'll feature over 500 Creation Club elements - Creation Club being Bethesda's curated pool of officially sanctioned mods, which would usually need to be purchased with credits - including quests, dungeons, bosses, weapons, and spells.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking for a couple more video game freebies to shove unceremoniously into your almost certainly already overstuffed 'to do' pile, Epic has you covered, with Yooka-Laylee and Void Bastards currently free on its PC store.
Yooka-Laylee, if you're unfamiliar, is a spiritual successor to Rare's beloved platformer Banjo-Kazooie - and was developed by Playtonic, a studio founded by a number of ex-Rare veterans. Lizard and bat replace bear and bird in Yooka-Laylee, but the formula will be immediately familiar to Banjo-Kazooie fans, setting players loose across a number of sprawling, predominantly platforming-focussed worlds as they embark on an perky, old-school collectathon in search of missing Quills.
All in all, it's a decently entertaining adventure (although its superb side-scrolling sequel, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, is far superior), and one that Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a "sumptuous, diverting homage to a bygone era in game design that should keep fans of the old school hooked, even if it doesn't set the world on fire."

Announced during Quakecon's opening livestream session (which saw id's Marty Stratton and Kevin Cloud, alongside Machine Games' Jerk Gustafsson, reflecting on Quake 25th anniversary), the newly enhanced version of Quake includes visual improvements, online and local split-screen multiplayer, plus a wealth of additional content.
Purchasers will receive the original Quake, its two official expansions - The Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity - plus two expansions created by Wolfenstein: The New Order developer Machine Games: Dimensions of the Past and the all-new Dimension of the Machine. Additionally, mods are supported on PC, while console player will be able to enjoy a selection of curated mods (as was the case for id's updated versions of Doom on consoles) at a later date.

        <link href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-ghost-of-tsushima-how-sony-tackled-the-cross-gen-save-problem"/>
        <updated>2021-08-19T12:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima has been given a proper PlayStation 5 upgrade, increasing resolution, decreasing loading times and removing pre-rendered cinematics for full real-time alternatives. It's a decent - though not exactly game-changing - upgrade, but what did catch our eye beyond this is how the new PS5 version imports any existing PlayStation 4 game saves you may have on your system. It's not a completely seamless experience, but the fact is that cross-save now works, allowing you to easily pick up on PS5 where you left off on PS4. 
The technical explanation for PlayStation 5's cross-save issues is fairly straightforward. Up until recently, the PS5 system software has no visibility or access to any PlayStation 4 data on your console, meaning that highly convoluted means were required to move progress from one generation to the next. Essentially, the PS4 version of the game had to be patched to allow game saves to be uploaded to the cloud. Moving over to PS5, the cloud data would then be downloaded and progress could continue. Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered are two good examples of this workaround in action. However, more recent titles including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and now Ghost of Tsushima have allowed for native import of PS4 games.
We had a look at Sony's SDK roadmap a while back and the concept of allowing PlayStation 5 titles to access PlayStation 4 user data was promised for a future update, which now appears to have rolled out. The first time I loaded Ghost of Tsushima, I disconnected my PS5 from the internet to rule out any potential cloud transfers, accessed the PS4 save game transfer option and discovered that all of my PS4 saves were available - the same saves I generated when I looked at the PS5 60fps patch for the game back in January. In turn, those saves were transferred across from my PS4 Pro using USB storage.

True Colours sees the Life is Strange series heading off to another picturesque corner of the United States - this time to a small Colorado town, Haven Springs, in the shadow of the Rockies - for a brand-new adventure featuring a predominantly new cast of characters.
Here, the focus is on new protagonist Alex Chen who, unusually for the series, has lived with her powers - enabling her to hear the thoughts of other characters, as well as view and experience their emotions - for some time prior to the start of the adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ignition Entertainment's cult classic action-adventure El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron finally has a PC release date and will be making its way to Steam on 2nd September.
El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron - which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, having originally launched for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011 - is perhaps the first and only game to be inspired by the apocryphal Book of Enoch.
It recounts the story of Enoch (re-imagined as blond, denim-clad pretty boy) as he hunts downs seven fallen angels at the behest of God - a quest that blends 3D and side-on platform segments with some deceptively simple, and thrillingly balletic, three-weapon combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oddworld: Soulstorm, the most recent entry in developer Oddworld Inhabitants' long-running adventure saga, is currently in the works for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.
Soulstorm - the direct sequel to 2014's Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty and a re-imagining of second series entry, 1998's Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus - initially released for PlayStation and PC back in April to somewhat mixed reviews.
Eurogamer's Christian Donlan, for instance, lamented the action-platformer's "unwelcome - and distinctly un-Oddworldly - scrappiness", which frequently manifested in a litany of unfortunate progress-thwarting bugs. "A shame, really, because once I got through that," he continued, "I was often swept along with the invention and vehemence and ugly beauty of what's on offer in an Oddworld game. At their best these games really do things no other games do."

Yesterday, Fortnite developer Epic announced a new game mode for its all-encompassing battle royale that has an uncanny resemblance to 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game Among Us.
Fortnite Impostors sees 10 players, eight agents and two impostors play out their roles on a submarine. Like in Among Us, the agents carry out routine assignments, while the impostors sabotage the facility and eliminate players. Impostors can also teleport players to cover their tracks and disable assignments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making games, we are often reminded, is hard, with development frequently being derailed by the most preposterously unpredictable things. Behold, for instance, the newly revealed story of Skyrim's iconic cart ride, and how it was, for a time before release, routinely thwarted by a particularly stubborn bee.
The full tale was recently recounted on Twitter by 14-year Bethesda veteran - and now solo indie developer - Nate Purkeypile, who served as senior world and lighting artist during the creation of Skyrim. "That intro is famous now," Purkeypile wrote, "but back then, it was just that one thing that we had to keep working and working on forever."
According to Purkeypile, the cart ride was particularly prone to mishaps during development because its bumps and bounces toward Helgen were physically simulated ("Why you ask?," he adds, "Good question.") - meaning environmental objects carelessly strewn about the place had a tendency to make the vehicle behave unpredictably, sometimes causing it to fly off the road. As the developer puts it, "The cart had a path it wanted to follow, but that doesn't mean it was a path it COULD follow."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Cyan Worlds' previously Oculus Quest-exclusive remake of seminal CD-ROM puzzle adventure Myst is coming to PC, Mac, and Xbox on 26th August.
This "definitive, modern edition" of Myst (not to be confused with the game's first fully 3D remake, realMyst, released back in the year 2000) debuted on the Oculus Store last December, significantly sprucing up the iconic islands first introduced to players back in 1993.
New art and sound are the most obvious improvements to the original game - alongside a photo mode to easily record clues and a randomised puzzle option for those seeking a greater challenge - but this latest version of Myst is also "built from the ground up" for VR.

        <updated>2021-08-17T18:24:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt is readying to release Cyberpunk 2077's "biggest patch to date" - the third major update since the RPG's disastrous launch last December - and has now shared full details of what it will bring, including an improved minimap and the game's first selection of free DLC.
Prior to Cyberpunk's launch, CD Projekt whipped up player interest with the promise of free post-launch DLC. However, plans for additional content were put on hold while the developer worked to fix the game's litany of bugs and to bring Cyberpunk's widely lambasted last-gen console release up to a more acceptable standard. Now though, according to senior quest designer Patrick Mills on tonight's 1.3 update dev stream, "streaming and memory management" have reached a point "where we can start trying to deliver those things".
As such, 1.3 includes the first of Cyberpunk 2077's free DLC, mostly falling into the category of 'minor cosmetic additions'. There are two new jackets - a red and shiny number, plus a grey and yellow option with a fur collar - alongside the Quartz Bandit: an orange and black car with its innards on the outside. The jackets and car are two separate rewards unlocked by completing small objectives received on reaching certain points in the game (anyone beyond those point will get the DLC on loading a save), and CD Projekt says future DLC drops will follow the same pattern of integration, with the goal being to make the world feel a little richer.

Fortnite Imposters sees 10 players, eight agents and two imposters play out their roles on a submarine. Like in Among Us, the agents carry out routine assignments, while the imposters sabotage the facility and eliminate players. Imposters can also teleport players to cover their tracks and disable assignments. 
Of course, it wouldn't be Fortnite without a few memes. For a short period‌, a "Peely Party" takes place where all agents and imposters look like Peely, an iconic character of judicial significance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A writer on Rainbow Six Siege has expressed their pride at the game's first transgender operator, who arrives with the Crystal Guard season update.
Narrative writer, Simon Ducharme, said they are "incredibly proud" of developing the character and had "tears of joy" knowing they were "encouraged and supported" to write queer characters.
Speaking to Gamespot, Ducharme added: "The decision to create a transgender character was made early on, as part of our initiative to have an inclusive roster of Operators. The consultants, all of whom are trans people, wanted to make sure that Osa was presented as authentically and organically as possible. She was written by a queer person and she is voiced by a trans woman - and while her identity is certainly influenced by her gender, who she is in the Siege universe is centered on her talents, her influence on Nighthaven, and her close friendship to Kali."

In a financial statement, Polish company People Can Fly said that up to 16th August, it had not received royalties on the sale of the co-op-focused looter-shooter from publisher Square Enix.
Royalties would be paid to PCF if the net receipts from the sales of Outriders yielded the pre-agreed level of returns for Square Enix on the costs incurred relating to quality assurance, distribution and marketing. Essentially, the contract states PCF gets its royalties on profits only after Square Enix makes back its investment.

YouTuber Specilizer found multiplayer assets in the game that point to a large multiplayer map, which they speculate could be for a Factions battle royale mode given the size of the map. Considering the development period and release date of the game saw the explosive rise of battle royale games like Fortnite and PUBG, it makes sense Sony would have wanted to explore the genre with a first-party title.
Other assets include a "Listen-Mode-Device", which could potentially be the way to use listen mode in multiplayer. There are also backpack and armour models specifically for multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years after its arrival in Dead by Daylight, Stranger Things is returning to the Upside Down, with all DLC inspired by Netflix's hit show being removed from sale this November. But as Dead by Daylight starts its long goodbye to one franchise, it's preparing to say hello to another, with all signs pointing to the imminent arrival of Hellraiser in-game.
First introduced in September 2019, Dead by Daylight's Stranger Things collaboration ushered in two new survivors - Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler - alongside new killer The Demogorgon, and the Underground Complex Map.
For reasons unspecified (although almost certainly licensing-related), The Demogorgon, Nancy, and Steve - plus each characters' respective outfit cosmetics - will no longer be available for purchase in Dead by Daylight's store from 17th November.

Developed by Shantae studio WayForward and released in 2011, Betrayal marked a notable shift for the BloodRayne series, ditching the third-person action of previous instalments in order to send half-vampire protagonist Rayne on a side-scrolling hack-and-slash adventure through 15 monster-battering stages of spooky old castle.
For Betrayal's imminent remaster - officially known as BloodRayne Betrayal: Fresh Bites - WayForward and publisher Ziggurat Interactive are promising a range of improvements, including the addition of full voice acting to enliven the text-only original.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[John Romero still isn't done with Doom; the legendary designer has confirmed he's currently working on a follow-up to his "unofficial" Doom episode, Sigil.
Announced to coincide with Doom's 25th anniversary in 2018 and released as a free megawad the following year, Sigil was designed as the unofficial fifth episode in the original Doom saga - picking up after Ultimate Doom's Thy Flesh Consumed - and treated fans to 18 brand-new, Romero-designed levels: nine single-player and nine death match.
Two years on from its release, Sigil was looking increasingly like a one-off experiment for Romero, but now - in a new video interview with Bridgeburner, lead developer on Doom total conversion The Age of Hell (skip to the 42-minute mark) - the designer has confirmed he's currently working on a sequel, this time utilising Doom 2.
