Development will, according to an announcement buried at the bottom of Call of Duty's most recent community update, be handled by long-time Call of Duty studio Infinity Ward. The developer is also said to be working on a new Warzone "experience", both being designed together and both built from the "ground up" using a new engine.

Mask of the Rose takes place in 1862, around three decades prior to the events of Sunless Sea and Failbetter's acclaimed browser game Fallen London, and focuses on events shortly after the city (an alternate-universe version of Victorian London) is stolen by bats and carried to a vast underground cavern system deep beneath the Earth's surface.

The PC and Xbox versions remain unaffected, however, and will release unedited at launch on 24th February.
Martha is Dead unfolds in Tuscany, 1944, against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict between German and Allied forces; as its story begins, the body of a woman, Martha, is discovered by the side of a lake deep in the Italian countryside, and players - in the role of her twin sister - must deal with the repercussions of the murder, "all whilst the horror of war draws ever closer".

In a lot of ways, its business as usual for Disgaea 6; once again, the series conjures up a ridiculous, comedic yarn to frame its strategy action - this time focusing on new protagonist Zed, a teenage zombie on a quest to defeat the God of Destruction - all in service to the series' wonderfully compelling turn-based battling and drive for ever-higher numbers.

Salt and Sacrifice, as is amply evident from its release date trailer below, reprises much that made the original so good, serving up another deliciously gloomy slab of side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat. It promises to be more than a retread of past glories, however, offering players - this time in the role of a Marked Inquisitor - a range of new features to experiment with, including a refreshed choice of classes: Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Man's Sky - Hello Games' ever-evolving exploratory space sim - will be packing down all 18 quintillion of its procedurally generated planets and squeezing them onto Switch this summer.
It's certainly an ambitious undertaking given the Switch's comparative limitations and the generally demanding nature of No Man's Sky's procedural core, and Hello admits the project - which a small team at the studio has been "secretly working on" for the last couple of years - has been a "real moonshot".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Kirby and the Forgotten Land was unveiled at today's Nintendo Direct, and the pink puffball has a new trick up his sleeve - Mouthful Mode.
This mode will allow Kirby to inhale and then embody everyday objects around him during his quest to save the imprisoned Waddle Dees. Yes, this means Kirby will be able to inhale a car, and then corporally drive around the environment. He will also be able to inhale vending machines, and then use its contents to attack his foes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's just announced an update for the series that started as a Wii pack-in. Nintendo Switch Sports will land on the Switch on the 29th of April.
Nintendo Switch Sports sees three classic sports returning - Tennis, Bowling and Chambara. You'll also be able to play three new games: Soccer (Football), which uses a giant ball, just like real soccer (football), Badminton, which will please friend of Eurogamer Ed Thorn, and Volleyball. I don't know why I capitalised all the sports but it's too late to change that now.

The first series entry, Super Mario Strikers (also known as Mario Smash Football in Europe), initially launched for GameCube all the way back in 2005, foisting a typically Nintendo spin on the beloved sport. If you're unfamiliar with the game, think a Mario Golf or Mario Tennis style makeover - replete with game-changing items and ludicrous special attacks - but 5v5 football action, and you're pretty much there.

Re-Boot Camp includes both Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. Both are absolute classics - brightly coloured turn-based gems that are fiercely replayable. The remake has a chunky 3D art style that a lot of people find hard to love, but it's not the only new element, by the sounds of things. Nintendo also announced that the COs will now be voiced, you'll be able to fast-forward gameplay and reset moves, and there are a handful of additional modes too.

The Wolf Among Us 2 has, of course, had an eventful journey to reach this point; the original game - a five-episode story-driven adventure based on Bill Willingham's Fables comic book - released almost a decade ago in 2013 to much acclaim, and the demand for a sequel was immediate. The news fans had been waiting for eventually arrived in 2017, with confirmation The Wolf Among Us 2 was in development, but progress on the title regrettably halted after developer Telltale Games shut its doors the following year.

Now, however, in a lengthy blog post laying out a number of commitments as its acquisition bid goes through regulatory approval around the world, Microsoft has spoken of its exclusivity plans in its clearest terms yet.

The inclusion of esports at the upcoming Birmingham games will be known as the Commonwealth Esport Championships. This event will be a pilot, and therefore no medals will be awarded to the winners. There are hopes from the organisers, however, that this pilot will be successful, with the theory being it will draw in a younger audience to the games themselves.

It has, of course, been a bumpy few months for Battlefield 2042; just days after its release last November, the DICE-developed shooter gained the unenviable accolade of being one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time. Eurogamer's Martin Robinson was equally damning, going as far as to call its launch "a disaster", writing, "Since Battlefield 2042 went live on Friday, I've endured hard crashes, server problems and whole nights where the whole thing is simply unplayable...This is another Battlefield that's launching in a sorry state."

As spotted by VGC, Bandai Namco made the announcement as part of its newly released mid-term plan spanning April 2022 to March 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were sad faces all round when Microsoft announced Scalebound, its highly anticipated monster-bothering collaboration with Bayonetta developer PlatinumGames, had been cancelled, leaving fans of the studio to ponder what might have been if events had transpired differently. And it seems Platinum itself is still eager to see the project reach fruition, now saying it "wants to discuss [its resurrection] with Microsoft properly".
Scalebound first surfaced during Microsoft's E3 showcase back in 2014, promising to transport players to a hostile world where - in the role of a cocky teen with a massive sword - they'd take on enormous creatures, with a little help from their dragon pal.

Intelligence collectors are everywhere, and government spy agencies are drowning in data. This is a radical new world and intelligence agencies are struggling to adapt to it. While secrets once conferred a huge advantage, today open source information increasingly does. Intelligence used to be a race for insight where great powers were the only ones with the capabilities to access secrets. Now everyone is racing for insight and the internet gives them tools to do it. Secrets still matter, but whoever can harness all this data better and faster will win...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

While a charming inclusion in its own right, the mastermind behind Bioshock's "Bread Boy" has now revealed more insight into why he is there.
It was a simple fan post from Twitter user Pocklecool that once more brought "Bread Boy" back to the fore of our minds, commenting on the fact that the game's shorthand for being in Paris was a small boy delightedly twirling a baguette in his arms. The tweet, perhaps understandably, blew up, catching the attention of Gwen Frey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite originally launching back in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V remains a force to be reckoned with; according to Take-Two's latest quarterly earnings report, Rockstar's irrepressible open-world opus has managed to shift another 5m copies since November, bringing its lifetime sales up to 160m - and the publisher also had a little more to say about NFTs.
Alongside Grand Theft Auto V's quarterly rise, Take-Two's updated numbers show a continuing boost for the GTA series as a whole, which has now sold over 370 million units - an increase of 15m since November. However, as the publisher opted not to share sales data for its much-maligned GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, it's unclear how much the troubled remaster contributed to that remaining 10m figure - although CEO Strauss Zelnick did say the game had "significantly exceeded" the company's commercial expectations.

Introduction
SIG Multicluster is the SIG focused on how Kubernetes concepts are expanded and used beyond the cluster boundary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has reportedly "deprioritised" its consumer-facing game streaming platform Stadia and now has a "reduced interest" in negotiating blockbuster titles for the service, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services' underlying technology to third-parties.
Stadia's misfortunes are well-documented; despite initial praise for the service's streaming capabilities at launch in 2019, a slow, problematic roll-out meant Google failed to capitalise on initial consumer interest. The extent of Stadia's failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Co-op platformer It Takes Two was widely praised by critics when it launched last March, even managing to secure a place in many an end-of-year best-of list in 2021; more than that, though, it's continued to resonate with players, and developer Hazelight Studios has now announced the game has surpassed the five million sales mark across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
It Takes Two, if you're unfamiliar, follows the adventures of Cody and May, a human couple preparing to divorce, who are forced to work together after being turned into living dolls. In gameplay terms, that translates to a wonderfully inventive split-screen platformer where careful co-operation is key. And while Eurogamer's Robert Purchase had reservations about its story in his review, he was still charmed enough by its antics to call it "a rare kind of co-op experience, with an energy and imagination and playfulness that sometimes rivals Nintendo's."

Let&#8217;s be clear: the new EARN IT Act would pave the way for a massive new surveillance system, run by private companies, that would roll back some of the most important privacy and security features in technology used by people around the globe. It&#8217;s a framework for private actors to scan every message sent online and report violations to law enforcement. And it might not stop there. The EARN IT Act could ensure that anything hosted online &#8212; backups, websites, cloud photos, and more &#8212; is scanned...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite having been some considerable time ago now, Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks' Ghostwire: Tokyo has remained a bit of a hard one to pin down, with previous gameplay trailers leaving more questions than answers. Now, however, with the game finally sporting a 25th March release date on PlayStation 5 and PC, Sony has offered an extended look at its action in a new livestream showcase.
Tango Gameworks is calling Ghostwire: Tokyo a "supernatural action-adventure thriller", and its story unfolds in an eerie, haunted version of Tokyo after nearly all the city's population has mysteriously vanished. Players take on the role of Akito, a young man who awakens in a deserted Tokyo street to discover that strange elemental powers are coursing through his veins - soon revealed to be the work of a spirit known as KK who has possessed Akito's body.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Risk of Rain 2's Survivors of the Void paid expansion finally has a launch date, and will be heading to PC on 1st March, with a console release to follow. And to celebrate the news, developer Hopoo Games has offered a closer look at the Railgunner - one of two new Survivors joining its enormously successful co-op rogue-like shooter sequel as part of the expansion.
Survivors of the Void brings a significant heft of new content to Risk of Rain 2 - ranging from new bosses and enemies to new items and stages - but the unifying theme (as its name does rather suggest) is The Void. The gateway to this mysterious realm has opened, spilling its innards all over Petrichor V. "For millennia, The Void Creatures have grown dominant by taking artifacts from our realm to theirs," Hopoo explains. "Now they look to add you to their collection."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The pesky fridge door in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy that never, ever, closes was inspired by long-running gags from Modern Family and Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia, its creative director has now revealed.
While many Marvel fans were likely spending their time hanging out with Groot and co while on board the Milano, others decided to take Star Lord even deeper into the inner workings of the ship. Here, they will have come across a broken fridge door, which in itself is fairly unremarkable. This door can be interacted with, and players can try and close it if they wish, but this would ultimately be to no avail. The fridge door will never remain closed, not matter how often one tries.

Apple hates this, since it would break its monopoly, and it&#8217;s making a variety of security arguments to bolster its argument. I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2022/01/letter-to-the-us-senate-judiciary-committee-on-app-stores.html">written</a> a rebuttal:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would like to address some of the unfounded security concerns raised about these bills. It&#8217;s simply not true that this legislation puts user privacy and security at risk. In fact, it&#8217;s fairer to say that this legislation puts those companies&#8217; extractive business-models at risk. Their claims about risks to privacy and security are both false and disingenuous, and motivated by their own self-interest and not the public interest. App store monopolies cannot protect users from every risk, and they frequently prevent the distribution of important tools that actually enhance security. Furthermore, the alleged risks of third-party app stores and &#8220;side-loading&#8221; apps pale in comparison to their benefits. These bills will encourage competition, prevent monopolist extortion, and guarantee users a new right to digital self-determination...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

His OlliOlli World cameo will be the actor's second video game appearance in a little over two months, having been given a starring role in his own Far Cry 6's DLC at the end of last year.

Maggie was, of course, confirmed as Season 12's new hero earlier this week in her very own Stories from the Outlands animated introduction, and Respawn's new launch trailer picks up pretty much right where that left off, with Maggie being flown into the Apex Games, as decreed during her trial. From there, it's as chaotic as ever, with Maggie showing an unsuspecting solider what for, and, eventually, having a brief reunion with Fuse - who fans might recall was a long-time friend until a disagreement that left Fuse minus one arm.

The original AI: The Somnium Files - which was the work of Zero Escape series creator and director Kotaro Uchikoshi - was a noir-ish murder mystery set in a technologically-advanced modern-day Tokyo. Nirvana Initiative, which once again sees Uchikoshi on scenario writing duties, retains the deductive premise of its predecessor but switches things up with a new pairing of protagonists and a new case to solve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a bit of a delay at the end of last year, Steam Deck is almost upon us, with Valve now confirming its highly anticipated portable gaming PC will begin shipping on 28th February.
Given the manufacturing constraints that continue to dog the tech industry amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Valve will be disseminating Steam Deck - as it confirmed when its reservations system opened last July - in waves throughout 2022 and beyond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With February (you may better know it by its more common name, Elden Ring month) less than a week away, it's time to do the subscription service additions dance once more. First up is PlayStation Plus, with Sony now confirming Planet Coaster, UFC 4, and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep as February's library additions.
It's a pleasingly eclectic bunch, that, starting with Frontier Developments' Planet Coaster, which joins PlayStation Plus for PlayStation 5 only. It's a game that seeks to serve up a heap of classic theme park management action, but even speaking as a huge management sim fan that's happy to hoover up anything the genre has to offer, Planet Coaster comes up disappointingly short if you're looking for a tycoon game with mechanical depth and interesting strategic play. Where it shines, though, is in its immensely powerful creation tools, giving players everything they need to build some truly breathtaking parks and rides.

Joe Danger Touch and its sequel Joe Danger Infinity (which initially came to iOS in 2013 and 2014 respectively) both fell foul of Apple's decision to end support for 32-bit apps with iOS11 back in 2017. However, over the last few years, Hello Games has, as detailed in its new announcement, been tinkering on the titles to get them playable again.

Having first hit Steam in 2018, Motorsport Games moved in on KartKraft last year, and the full release will see some 10 laser-scanned tracks, 20 kart manufacturers and plenty by way of mod support. It's also one of the better racing experiences you can get in VR, so is worth a punt if you prefer your driving games a bit more immersive.

Johnson is, of course, no stranger to video game movies, having starred in an adaption of id Software's first-person shooter Doom back in 2005 (by most accounts not an especially good movie) and more recently appearing in 2018's live-action version of arcade favourite Rampage (see previous comment).

Admission control is a key part of Kubernetes security, alongside authentication and authorization. Webhook admission controllers are extensively used to help improve the security of Kubernetes clusters in a variety of ways including restricting the privileges of workloads and ensuring that images deployed to the cluster meet organization’s security requirements.
However, as with any additional component added to a cluster, security risks can present themselves. A security risk example is if the deployment and management of the admission controller are not handled correctly. To help admission controller users and designers manage these risks appropriately, the security documentation subgroup of SIG Security has spent some time developing a threat model f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ABK Workers Alliance - a group of Activision Blizzard employees that has continued to push for major workplace reforms following last year's shocking reports detailing a culture of alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - has responded to today's news that Microsoft is buying the publisher, saying that while the move is "surprising", it does not change the group's goals.
The ABK Workers Alliance was established last summer, in response to a State of California lawsuit calling Activision Blizzard a "breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". Since then, the group has continued its mission to push for change at the publisher, launching a bid for unionisation, setting up a Strike Fund for employees, and calling for the removal (alongside the 1,800 employees that signed a related petition) of controversial CEO Bobby Kotick - who was said to have been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company "for years" in a damning Wall Street Journal report released in November.

It's a topic that was touched upon in the briefest of manners in Microsoft's original press release announcing the deal, with the company stating, "Activision Blizzard games are enjoyed on a variety of platforms and we plan to continue to support those communities moving forward."
