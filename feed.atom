        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, it's not your imagination - yes, there is a cat in Assassin's Creed Mirage that has a very deliberate Assassin's Emblem on his snout.

Even more amazingly still, the cat isn't even a work of fiction created by the dev team. It turns out that a fan shared an image of the sweet kitty after he "recently crossed the rainbow bridge" and after bringing him to the attention of the team and offering "coffee and Timbits" to any dev prepared to immortalise the cat in the game, it seems Ubisoft did precisely that.

"Am I reaching at straws here or?" asked suckashelfboi101 on the game's subreddit, seeking assurances that they weren't just seeing things. "Is this cats face supposed to look like the Assassin Emblem or what because it’s all I can see. Maybe something the devs put in for fun?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Talos Principle 2 is inviting you to try before you buy courtesy of a new Steam Next Fest demo.

Described as a "standalone" demo, players can get an early "bespoke" taste of the sequel's "bold new world" through a series of hand-picked puzzles spread across "stunning new locations, as well as a glimpse into the vast narrative that awaits them".

As Matt recently summarised for us, the original Talos Principle served up an often fiendishly cerebral bout of puzzle-solving with lasers, time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophy. Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle "rooms" that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress through the game.

"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when nine per cent of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go," the union explains on the Gamedevunion.pl website (as translated by Google Translate).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we creak ever closer to spooky season and a possible second Silent Hill Transmission – the last was just before Halloween 2022 – it seems Bloober Team has quietly been updating the backend of Silent Hill 2 Remake's Steam page.

In fairness, the store description and its accompanying tags have been tweaked routinely throughout the year, but according to Steam DB, there's been a flurry of activity through September and now October, including confirmation of language subtitles (Brazillian, Portuguese, and Ukrainian), tags, and Steam achievements, hinting that the in-game achievements have been finalised and signed off. The store assets and images have also been refreshed, too.

Concrete proof that an update or release is imminent? Hardly. But it's one of the strongest signals yet that development has entered the final straight, and the "coming soon" on the game's Steam page is accurate. Here's hoping we'll get a long-overdue update from Konami in the next week or so.

Hints that an expanded version of The Last of Us Part 2 is in development at Naughty Dog first surfaced back in July, when the game's composer, Gustavo Santaolalla, referenced a "new edition" that would enable players to interact with his banjo-playing cameo in the town of Jackson, selecting from a number of songs he can play.


Santaolalla wouldn't share any more details beyond that, leaving fans to ponder exactly what sort of "new version" he might be referring to, but now, thanks to a now-removed update on the LinkedIn profile of Naughty Dog's lead outsource artist Mark Pajarillo (as spotted by over on Resetera), we might finally have a clearer idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five months after release, Arkane Studios' beleaguered vampire shooter Redfall has received its long-promised 60fps mode on Xbox Series X/S, as part of a major patch that also brings improved performance on PC, stealth takedowns, increased enemy counts, and more.


A 60fps mode for Redfall was first touted back in April, after publisher Bethesda broke the news its game would be locked to 1440p and 30fps on both Xbox Series X and S at launch. At the time, the studio said a 60fps "performance mode" would be added at some point after release - although it's doubtful many were expecting it to take five moths to arrive.


Redfall's performance mode comes as part of a substantial update for Xbox Series X/S and PC touching on everything from gameplay and performance to accessibility. Patch notes promise "improved PC performance and stability across a wide range of hardware configurations", for instance, alongside fixes for memory crashes and graphical corruption on AMD GPUs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life may be full of regrets, but if one of those regrets is that you decided to call your Baldur's Gate 3 character Bumfart the Third in a moment of weakness, there's some good news: the game's latest hotfix will finally let you change their ill-conceived name.


That's the headline feature for Baldur's Gate 3's Hotfix #9 (or at least it is if you're a remorseful Bumfart), but there's more where that came from. The Magic Mirror, for instance, will - as well as enabling the aforementioned renaming unshaming - allow you to customise your hirelings if their outward appearance isn't to your liking.


Developer Larian notes the same restrictions apply to hirelings that apply when changing the appearance of the player character - presumably meaning you can give them a full aesthetic makeover to suit your dubious whims but you're stuck with their original race, sub race, and any cosmetic modifications resulting from gameplay.

Dave the Diver's previous big update, which released in August, was predominantly focused on quality of life improvements, and while there're plenty more of those stuffed into October's update, we get a bunch of new content too.


The glacier area, for instance - which primarily exists as a story-focused location with fewer missions compared to its counterparts right now - will receive new quests. Additionally, the ocean is set to welcome new species - crabs and lobsters - both requiring players to use special traps to catch. Oh, and a lobster party event will be added to coincide with their arrival.

For those of you wondering, a full team in Redfall multiplayer is made up of four players. Over the past week, Redfall's concurrent Steam player count dropped to a low of three, as recorded by SteamDB. Its peak during that same period of time is 38.
Redfall's launch didn't go as parent company Microsoft had hoped, as Phil Spencer revealed the company had expected the game to review much higher than it did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have a release date for American Arcadia: 15th November on PC (via Steam). So, if you are anything like me and rather looking forward to this release, thankfully there is not too much longer to wait. 


If you are unsure of what American Arcadia is all about, I will give you a little overview. It is by Out of the Blue, the same studio that gave us 2020's rather special Call of the Sea, and set in the "retro-futuristic '70 metropolis" Arcadia.


On the outside, Arcadia seems to promise its residents a life of cushy luxury, but all is not what it seems. In fact, the Arcadia residents are all part of a TV show, and they have no idea they are being recorded for the entertainment of the wider public (think The Truman Show). But, it is not all as innocent as that (not that that is especially innocent, really). You see, if the viewers don't like someone, well, it could end in their death. And this is something that our poor everyday man Trevor Hills is trying to avoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you may recall, earlier this year Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4 requires players to create new characters each season. And, with season two just around the corner, we thought it would be a good idea to let you know how to ensure you don't lose your stash as well as your character. 


When Diablo 4's current season - Season of the Malignant - comes to an end, players will see their seasonal characters moved over to the Eternal Realm with all their items - but there's a time limit to recover them. 


Items will be found in your stash in a new  "Withdraw Only Stash tab". But don't get complacent, as they won't stay here forever. If you want to withdraw any of your items from this chest, you will need to make sure you do so before Diablo 4's second season comes to a close. Otherwise, they will become "unrecoverable".

That date is still contingent on the UK's Competition and Markets Authority giving the deal an official green light - though the regulator has already signalled it is likely to do so. 


The CMA has until 18th October to weigh in with its final decision, following a deadline today for feedback on the deal's revised form - now Microsoft has agreed to sell off streaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft.

Reddit user Drbiohazmat has datamined the legs to find out some more detail: the legs have hair all over, a unique running and jumping animation, and a hole where a tail should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 has had a rather rocky start, with server issues plaguing its launch leaving many unable to play the always-online heist shooter. Now, another rock has made its way onto that already bumpy road, with developer Starbreeze announcing it has chosen to delay its upcoming patch. 


This patch was initially meant to be released yesterday, 5th October, and address "200+ QoL-improvements for all platforms". However, the developer has pushed it back until an unspecified time in mid-October. This, the Payday 3 team has said, is to "ensure its stability".


"The patch needs some changes that would require us to go through console certification again," Starbreeze explained. In a follow up post, the team confirmed that this will mean the game's "PS5 bonus content will remain unredeemable until this patch is ready".

The game was patched a couple of weeks back but, as anticipated, this new patch is aimed at PvP and makes changes to the majority of weapons - including the game's best.


Yes, I'm talking about the Songbirds and Zimmerman.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the topic of video game industry layoffs, something that seems to be rarely out of the headlines over the past few weeks and months. 
Layoffs are nothing new, of course, but this year in particular feels like a particularly tough time, at companies big and small. From tech giants such as Microsoft and Epic Games down to development studios such as Telltale Games, the bad news just keeps on coming. 
We discussed the job losses at Creative Assembly last week following the cancellation of Hyenas. Since then, we've heard of deep cuts at Team17, and more job losses on Dragon Age. We consider these examples and more, and consider whether each is part of a wider pattern, or a more individual example. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

News of layoffs at Telltale began circulating after cinematic artist Jonah Huang - who's worked at the studio in both its current and original incarnation, which closed down in 2018 - claimed the studio "laid most of us off early September".


Huang also appeared to imply further troubles for The Wolf Among Us 2 - which was originally due to release this year before Telltale pushed it back into 2024 to avoid burnout and crunch - saying he couldn't comment on the status of its development due to a binding NDA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like forever ago that For the King 2 - the sequel to IronOak Games' wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure - was announced (it was actually about 18 months ago, it turns out), but it finally has a release date and is coming to Steam on 2nd November.


For the King 2, which is set some 20 years after the events of the first game, promises another bout of optionally co-operative rogue-like adventuring - this time for up to four pals both locally and online - as players take on the kingdom of Fahrul's tyrannical queen. 


Everything shown so far suggests the sequel is more about refinement than radical reinvention, meaning you should expect the same blend of familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - with some neat story generation through and randomised narrative events, only this time with a few notable tweaks.

As reported by IGN, former Bungie HR manager Ingrid Alm - who joined the studio in May 2022 - filed a complaint in the state of Washington earlier this year, citing retaliation and wrongful termination. Alm alleges she was fired from Bungie after being asked to investigate a Black employee, referred to as "James Smith" in court documents, who responded by saying he felt he was being racially targeted by his supervisor.


As a result, Alm recommended Smith's supervisor receive diversity training, but says her suggestion was met with "hostility and denial" - it's claimed she was told the supervisor had "been there for a long time" and was "highly regarded" - and her recommendation was denied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a week after announcing it was delaying fishing horror Dredge's first paid expansion, The Iron Rig, into 2024, developer Black Salt Games has unveiled an entirely different paid expansion, The Pale Reach, which arrives on 16th November.


The Pale Reach plots a course for a "new, frozen frontier", where players will need to navigate treacherous icy canyons - soon also likely to succumb to the malevolence seen elsewhere in the game - following the trail of a long-forgotten expedition to see what became of its crew.


It's a trip that'll first require players to equip their boat with specialised gear capable of smashing through the ice, and once the voyage is underway, there'll be new story content, 11 new fish and crab species (as well as their aberrated counterparts), a new fish type, plus new achievements and trophies. Black Salt Games also teases a new item that'll extend "the freshness of catches no matter where you're fishing", over on the PlayStation Blog.

Following its recently released Phantom Liberty expansion and the base game's extensive 2.0 update, developer CD Projekt Red has announced a partnership with Anonymous Content to develop a brand-new, live-action story set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077. I wonder if they will bring Idris Elba and Keanu Reeves back for the occasion?


This live-action project is still in the very early stages of development, with the studios involved still on the hunt for a screenwriter to take the lead.


While the search continues, several members from media company Anonymous Content have been confirmed to be on board. Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, and Bard Dorros will all be part of this project's production, which CDPR said will be developed in "close collaboration" with Cyberpunk 2077's creative team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TV Tokyo has released the first trailer for a new live-action Pokémon drama series called Pack Your Pocket With Adventure (literal translation), or Pokétsume for short.
Pokétsume has been made in collaboration with The Pokémon Company, and stars actress and former girl group member Nishino Nanase as Madoka Akagi, an adult who finds out the working world is not how she dreamt it would be. Her mother sends her her old Game Boy and Pokémon Red cartridge, and she decides to start playing Pokémon again.
As she carries on playing Pokémon Red, Madoka begins to find the same energy as her game character to work through her hardships in real life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Rockstar quietly added a 60fps toggle to Red Dead Redemption on PlayStation 5. The game, which was released back in August for both PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, can be played on PS5 thanks to backwards compatibility. And now, that little toggle gives PlayStation 5 users a new framerate to play around with while exploring the Wild West. 


However, there are some Xbox Series X/S players who are now feeling rather left out by Rockstar, asking where their 60fps Red Dead Redemption port is.


When Rockstar brought Red Dead Redemption to PlayStation 4 and Switch, it directed its Xbox community to the original 360 version of the game. As Digital Foundry noted earlier this year, the Xbox Series X and One X versions of Red Dead Redemption are running on the 360 code, with a higher resolution, anisotropic filtering, and a negative LOD bias to enhance texture mip-maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mobile developer Hutch Games has corrected store listings for two of its free-to-play games following complaints filed with the UK Advertising Standards Authority, and described its omission of explicit disclosure of loot boxes a "mistake".
The complaints were made by researcher Leon Y. Xiao, who has conducted studies on the effectiveness of Belgium's loot box ban and the consistency of loot box warnings on games.  
Xiao filed complaints regarding Hutch Games for Rebel Racing on the Google Play Store and F1 Clash - Car Racing Manager on the Apple App Store, and said that both games failed to mention the presence of loot boxes. Current ASA guidance states advertising must make it clear if loot boxes exist in a game, with a notification on store pages at a minimum.

50 staff were let go in August, as part of a move the company said would make the studio "more agile and more focused". Several veteran team members were included in the cuts, including two writers who had each worked at the studio for over 20 years. 


Now, a group of seven people - with an average of 14 years at BioWare between them - have requested further compensation from the company, with a payout calculated to take their years of service into consideration.

Presenting Elephant Mario 64, a combination of work between a group of modders, known as SM64ex-coop, to add Elephant Mario to Super Mario 64. He's fully playable, minus any Elephant form abilities, and is complete with a tiny tail sticking out from his overalls.
The model was made by modder Koop the Koopa, with some alterations from YouTuber Unreal (no, not that one) to allow for colour customisation. The bottom of Elephant Mario's feet are pink and can't be changed due to how the model is structured, Unreal notes, but I rather like it. It makes it look like he's got a bunch of toe beans on his soles.

YouTube channel Volound shared an eye-opening video on the recent cancellation, with claims from anonymous developers detailing a "total lack of direction" around the game, with one contributor stating many members of the leadership team were "asleep at the wheel but they never seemed to lose their jobs". The same source noted an engine change and "not committing to doing anything adventurous with the game" were all part of Hyenas' ultimate demise. 


Another contributor said that internal feedback on the game was poor, adding it was felt that Hyenas would "melt into the background of an already saturated multiplayer shooter market". These claims have since also been corroborated by VGC.

These ex-employees included the company's now-disgraced chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, once the right-hand man to Ubisoft's overall boss Yves Guillemot, as well as its former editoral boss Tommy François, French newspaper Libération reported today.


The five ex-Ubisoft employees were reportedly picked up by police over the past 24 hours and questioned at a police station in Paris. The action comes three years after claims of sexual misconduct involving Hascoët, François and others came to light, as part of a wave of allegations that rocked Ubisoft in the summer of 2020. Both Hascoët and François departed the company shortly afterwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone, the creator of beloved farming sim Stardew Valley, has celebrated one million followers by sharing four new screenshots of forthcoming next game Haunted Chocolatier.


Shared on X, formerly Twitter, the four screenshots show some new areas: an interior home and shop, a vivid forest, a mermaid fountain in (presumably) the town square, and a creepy library with a peering skeleton.


That forest screenshot also shows the character shooting at a leafy creature with a bow and arrow, suggestive of the increased combat focus compared with Stardew.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The free-to-play MOBA-meets-hero-shooter game Gigantic is being revived for a "limited time throwback event".

Fans of the game began receiving emails yesterday from Gearbox Publishing, née Perfect World Entertainment, inviting them to play Gigantic from 5th to 7th October.

Gigantic was released in 2017 as an Xbox One and PC exclusive. Almost exactly one year later, developer Motiga closed Gigantic following its struggle to "break through in a crowded market". The game was delisted and its servers were shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's launch, Nintendo released a quietly devastating trailer for its game that showed a real life, 'everyday' man going about his business in a rather subdued manner. 


Even his home life seemed to have become mundane, with him and his wife only really seeing each other briefly after a long day in the office, before she popped off to bed. Well, thank goodness for Zelda, as not only did Tears of the Kingdom give a welcome boost to our suffering man's evening, it now seems that it has also improved his marriage. 


In a new trailer, we are once again reunited with Nintendo's sad man and his wife, and once again, he is playing Zelda. But, oh! He seems to be having a bit of trouble with one of the game's many shrines. His partner looks over, and gives some sage advice. "Ah, that's how it's done," he seems to think, while throwing her an adoring smile (honestly, it is so pure and lovely, and kind of the way my dog looks at food).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced it is ending online play services for both the 3DS and Wii U. These services will be terminated "as of early April 2024," the company wrote in an update earlier today. 


Nintendo has been steadily winding down its support for these older consoles, having sunsetted the eShop for both platforms last year. Of course, this had no effect on the online play capabilities of the games. 


However, as of April next year, games on either the Wii U or 3DS will only be playable offline. This means "online cooperative play, internet rankings and data distribution" will also be affected. It also means no more online town hopping in Animal Crossing: New Leaf (pictured above).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's MineCon Live - developer Mojang's annual celebration of all things Minecraft - is right around the corner, and ahead of the big day on 15th October, the studio is holding its yearly mob vote, with choice number one having now been revealed as the crab.


Minecraft's annual mob vote, if you're unfamiliar, gives players the chance to collectively decide on the creature they'd like to see added to the blockbusting survival sandbox next. Previously mob votes have resulted in the likes of the Glow Squid, Panda, Phantom, Llama, and Sniffer all ending up in-game, and the crab is now vying for a place in that illustrious line-up.


As per Mojang's animated video introducing the crab, should voters shunt the little fella into first place, it'll be found within the mangrove swamp biome. We're also told about its crab claw, which, once acquired, will enable players to place blocks further away than would normally be possible - a bit of a builder-focused utility, then, this one.

Warcraft Rumble - formerly known as Warcraft Arclight Rumble - promises a blend of strategy and tower defense across a its 70-mission single-player campaign, which features some familiar heroes and villains from the Warcraft universe, including Warsong chieftain Grommash Hellscream and Archmage Jaina Proudmoore.


In order to tackle Rumbles' various scenarios, players must assemble an army, choosing leaders, troops, and spells from the game's 65+ collectible character Minis, each of which has its own distinctive "talents" for use in battle. These also come into play across Rumble's other modes and features, including co-op, PvP, guilds, raids, and dungeons.

Carter describes Moonring as a "retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games" - albeit one "created from the ground up with modern design sensibilities" - and it all plays out across the mysterious land of Caldera, a place of "Devotion and Dreamers, Gods and Gifts", where players take on the role of Dreamless.


"Travel, trade, sneak, fight and sail the world of Caldera," teases Moonring's Steam page. "Speak with the townsfolk, learn Caldera's secrets, and challenge the Archon for his throne... or even overthrow the Gods themselves!".

The controller is inspired by the official Shadow range of controllers released during the lifetime of the Xbox One. It has a gold-to-black metallic finish on the front, creating an illusion of a shadow cast at the bottom of the grips, while the rest of the controller is carbon black.

The gold metallic finish extends to the D-pad. There are rubberised diamond-pattern side grips, unlike your bog standard Xbox controller.

As previously confirmed, from today (3rd October) you can get your hands on Gotham Knights (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X S) and The Lamplighter's League (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X S). 

Gotham Knights got a mixed response from our Chris Donlan upon its release last year. He called it a "slight muddle of a game", but noted it still "has its pleasures" in Eurogamer's review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic has announced it's introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it calls its evolution into a "multi-game ecosystem".


Third-party developed content in Fortnite has become an increasing focus for Epic in recent times, and the company introduced its Unreal Editor for Fortnite tools - also known as Creative 2.0 - back in March. These enable creators to bring fully fledged Unreal Editor experiences into Fortnite, complete with custom assets, animations, audio, and advanced VFX effects, in a bid to turn the game into a creator-led platform closer to the likes of Roblox.


And now, as its "multi-game ecosystem" ambitions grow, Epic has announced it'll be making age ratings mandatory for all first- and third-party playable experiences in Fortnite as of 14th November this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a PlayStation 5 bundle which includes Marvel's Spider-Man 2. 


This bundle is set to release alongside the game on 20th October. As with earlier bundles for the likes of God of War: Ragnarök and Horizon Forbidden West, it will come with the standard PS5 console and a voucher to download a copy of the game.


While Sony hasn't officially released a price for this upcoming deal, according to Kotaku the bundle will cost $560 (so around £465), offering a small saving on buying the console and game separately. This is also cheaper than the previously announced Marvel's Spider-Man 2 limited edition bundle, which includes themed-hardware. That deal will set you back £569.99.

This patch addresses a range of issues across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including general fixes and character specific adjustments. However, the Nintendo Switch version of the game remains left out in the cold, at least for now, despite Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon previously promising fixes.


Sharing the patch notes online, Boon said the team will "kontinue to listen" and keep "lines of communication open" as it continues to improve its game (I just wish Boon would be a little more konsistent with his use of Ks).

Mediatonic was acquired by Epic in 2021. Last week, Mao stated they have received "no royalty payment" since the acquisition and voiced their frustration on Twitter.

I've been slowly chugging through Baldur's Gate 3 and two months after its release on PC, I finally reached Act Two this weekend. Upon meeting His Majesty for the first time last night, my initial reaction was "ah, this is the bald cat everyone was upset about," and I can understand why. With the hair, he just doesn't command the same respect.

Pioneers of Pagonia was revealed back in February, promising a city building adventure set across the mysterious islands of Pagonia, where players must work to steadily increase their reach and influence among the islands' many (not always friendly) inhabitants through resource gathering, production, economic expansion, and exploration.


When Pioneers of Pagonia enters early access in December, only some of its final features will be available, including procedural map generation, over 40 different building types, plus more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. The likes of co-op play, new buildings, new production chains, and other improvements are expected to arrive in the six months or so of development planned ahead of a full 1.0 release.

Galyonkin's career in the games industry spans more than two decades but he gained renown after establishing Steam Spy in 2015, a project he continued to run after joining Epic as Eastern European head of publishng in 2016. A year later, Galyonkin became the company's director of publishing strategy, with a specific focus on Epic's store, and he's remained in that role since. 


Now, though, Galyonkin has revealed his time at the company is over. "Today is officially my last day at Epic Games," he wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. "These eight years have been some of the most exciting in my career, and I am deeply grateful to my former Epic Games colleagues and Tim Sweeney for allowing me to help build Epic 4.0."

Want to know more about Trek to Yomi? Well, let me quickly samurai-se it for you. In Trek to Yomi, which is set in Japan during the Edo period, players take on the role of a young warrior named Hiroki. Hiroki will have to face the "forces of evil" as he tries to make amends for failing to protect his village from a brutal onslaught.


The Black-and-white samurai curio is set to leave the service on 16th October, so if you were interested in taking up your sword and having a go for yourself, but hadn't managed to get round to it yet, this is a little reminder to snap it up while you can.

The rebranded FIFA bumped boxed game juggernaut Hogwarts Legacy into third place in terms of the biggest 2023 UK physical game launches. Only The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold more. 


While boxed sales are declining across the board, annual mass market titans FIFA and Call of Duty have held onto a sizable - if shrinking - slice of physical sales. A further drop in boxed numbers this year was somewhat inevitable, though a 30 percent fall is something of a jump.

The bug appears to have been introduced with patch 2.0.1, which rolled out alongside the DLC The Teal Mask on 13th September.

Players have identified what triggers the game to crash and work-arounds whilst the bug persists. Here's the short version - if you have already registered the Legendary Paradox Pokémon which is native to your version of the game, don't try to swap Pokémon in slots four to six of your party into battle.

The exhibit at the museum in Amsterdam consists of six paintings of Pokémon in the style of Van Gogh, accompanied by a range of exclusive merchandise and a special Pikachu trading card. Sadly, footage of the exhibit's opening day, showed visitors hurriedly grabbing whatever merch they could to resell.

The merch was also available to buy on Pokémon Center webstores, though it quickly sold out. The items appear to have been prevented from appearing when searching on the UK Pokémon Center website, though the pages can still be found through search engines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre players have hit back at the game's monetisation strategy after Gun and Sumo outlined its plans for upcoming DLC.

"We've seen some discussion, and for transparency, we wanted to share pricing for any and all future content for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre," the team stated via a statement posted to its social media channels, including Twitter/X.

The tweet went on to give prices for upcoming skins and characters, confirming "premium content" – such as a Leatherface skin designed by Greg Nicotero – will cost $16, new characters, both victim and family, will sell for $10, executions $7, and clothing and weapon cosmetics for $5. Other content, such as "maps, etc.", will be released for free.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield was "made to played for a long time".

That's according to Bethesda boss Todd Howard himself, who said in a Game Maker’s Notebook interview with Insomniac CEO Ted Price that after watching how players interact with other Bethesda RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout, he believes "people want to play [games] for a very long time".

"This is a game that's intentionally made to be played for a long time. One of the things we’ve learned from our previous games, like Skyrim, like Fallout, is that people want to play them for a very long time," said Howard, as transcribed by VGC.

It's one of four designs issued by Foxdata in the late 1990s, which included controllers called Desert Storm, Red Rain, Purple Forest, and Chrome Leopard. 

Liam Clousdale – who had the latter Leopard variant – said he'd asked for the distinctive controller so that when he went to his friends' homes to play, "everyone liked to have their own unique pad [...] to avoid confusion".

The Pokémon exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam opened earlier this week, where a load of new Pokemon x Van Gogh merch was available, including a free trading card of a Van Gogh Pikachu designed to look like he was painted by the Dutch master himself. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, though, scalpers were quick to descend on the Van Gogh Museum, leaving many fans disappointed.

That's according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who reported yesterday that "even Bungie's expertise has not yet been able to turn PlayStation Studios into a service-game factory".

Just days after announcing its $3.6bn Bungie buyout bid, Sony announced back in April 2022 that it would launch more than 10 new live service games over the next four years, with the hope that Destiny developer Bungie would aid PlayStation in this major expansion of live service game development.

More Dredge, both free and paid, was confirmed to be on the way back in May, with the game's The Iron Rig expansion - focusing on the machinations of the Ironhaven Corporation - looking to be its most significant chunk of new content.


"Originally, we planned to spend a few months crafting this exciting addition and release it in Q4 this year," Black Salt Games explained in its delay announcement. "However, as we progressed, we were faced with the reality that, given the time of the year, we'd need more lead time to coordinate our marketing and make the launch as exciting as it could be."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt has detailed Cyberpunk 2077's first patch since the sci-fi RPG's big 2.0 update, promising, among other things, a fix for a save corruption issue affecting PlayStation 5 players.


As per the developer's newly shared pre-release patch highlights, update 2.01 should stop instances of corrupt saves on PS5 by increasing the maximum save file size limit. CD Projekt warns this won't fix saves impacted before the update, but advises affected players to keep a working save - by resaving it as a manual save - until 2.01 arrives.


Elsewhere in the update, CD Projekt is promising performance improvements on both PC and consoles, particularly in the Dogtown area, as well as a range of more specific fixes, included one especially specific issue that would see V sinking through the elevator floor and plummeting to their doom when attempting to reach the 42nd floor in Cyberpunk 2077's The Heist mission - but only in instances of low FPS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mediatonic, the UK developer behind Fall Guys, has been severely impacted by expected job losses as a result of yesterday's layoffs by Epic Games, though the studio itself will not be closed.


Epic Games acquired Mediatonic back in March 2021 after the studio's battle royale Fall Guys blew up in popularity. The deal was meant to secure Mediatonic's future. Now, despite the studio remaining open, that future looks very different indeed.


Last night, rumours swirled that the cuts were so deep the whole studio would close. But this isn't the case, team members I've spoken to have said, and Epic Games itself has now confirmed.

According to the game's publisher Gala Games, which specialises in this blockchain/Web3 business, Legacy's upcoming launch is "more than just a game release". In its words, this is "the beginning of an extraordinary journey where creativity, strategy, and business innovation meet". 


As someone who remains more than a touch sceptical about blockchain, I feel this remains to be seen.

In a new post over on X (formerly Twitter), Boon shared an image of some of media's most famous slasher-flick faces. Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, Jason, Mike Myers, Pinhead, Chucky, Jigsaw, and Ghostface all showed up in Boon's image, with a collection of either ticks or question marks across their faces. 


Many have surmised this means these less than friendly faces will soon be making their way into Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the game's DLC. As one fan noted in the replies, "Jigsaw would be perfect with the new Saw coming out".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer and Sony seem to be slowly removing traces of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake from the internet, sparking more concern that its future is in jeopardy. 


It has certainly been a tumultuous journey for this remake. After numerous leaks, Aspyr and Sony officially revealed their remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was in development back in 2021. At this time, it was announced the Star Wars game was being remade "from the ground up", and would launch as a timed console exclusive for PlayStation 5, and also for PC.


Since then, news on the remake has been less than optimistic. In May 2022, Aspyr's parent company Embracer announced that Evil Dead developer Saber Interactive had joined up with Aspyr to work on the remake. Then, in July, it was reported that the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake was "in serious trouble" and "delayed indefinitely".

Sega had previously teased the update would bring new playable characters, but now the update is live we know for sure it's those three. Though let's be honest, it was pretty obvious.


The update brings a new story expansion, which takes place before the final boss and envisions an alternative ending, with the three characters attempting to change their own fate. Check out the trailer below to see them in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we bid farewell to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who has announced his departure from the company after almost three decades of service. 
We look back at Ryan's tenure at the top of Sony's console business, which included the launch of PlayStation 5 and the acquisition of Bungie. Sony has seen huge sales successes, of course, but is this down to the company's continued direction or simply an open goal from the last console generation? 
Announced just before we recorded this week's show, we also discuss the shock cancellation of Hyenas, the loot shooter from Sega's UK studio Creative Assembly that was being demoed to the public only last month. Such a last-minute scrubbing of a game launch is startling - we discuss why the decision may have been made.

As spotted by IGN, The Elder Scrolls: Castles is now available to download, tasking players with managing their own, yes, castle through a steady process of room-by-room expansion, while also dealing with the whims of their kingdom - by deciding how to respond to their subjects' requests, Reigns-style - at the same time.


Oh, and there's a questing element too, in which players will need to create heroes, kit them out with gear, and send them into battle against "classic Elder Scrolls foes" in order to collect resources that'll come in hand elsewhere.

Minecraft Dungeons, a collaboration between Mojang and developer Double Eleven, was well-received when it launched in May 2020 - Eurogamer's Tom Phillips called it a "strong extension to the franchise, and by far the most promising Minecraft spin-off released to date" at the time.


By the time February 2021 rolled around, Minecraft Dungeons had amassed over 10m players, and was popular enough that a second season pass of DLC content was announced after its first came to and end. Mojang then announced it would introduce a live-service style seasonal model - complete with battle pass - as 2021 drew to a close.

Subpar Pool is described as a "whimsical adventure of playful pocket antics at the intersection of golf and pool", where players are challenged to progress through four varied worlds and a series of tables by pocketing balls within a set number of shots.


Play-throughs of Subpar Pool are procedurally generated based on parameters players can set beforehand by combining cards from a special 18-strong deck to suit their particular whims, with more than 14,000 combinations said to be possible.

Earlier today, InnerSloth, Sony, Schell Games and Robot Teddy announced that social deduction game Among Us will be coming to PS VR2. So, get ready to grab your Crewmates and then subsequently betray them all with a quick slice here or a subtle tongue impaling here. You know, as you do. 


When Among Us makes its way onto PS VR2, players can expect the usual likes of tasks, sabotages, venting, and those frantic emergency meetings where accusations begin to fly left, right and centre. But in addition to all this, Among Us VR on PS VR2 will also include new tasks and new features designed specfically for virtual reality. This includes 3D cosmetics, proximity voice chat, accessibility and comfort settings, safety and in-game moderation tools, crossplay compatibility, and custom lobby settings.

Around 250 employees will leave the company as a result of Epic's newly announced divestiture of Bandcamp and SuperAwesome.


"For a while now," Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote in an all-staff email now shared on the company's website, "we've been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators. I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.

With this update in play, any captures stored on the Xbox network will now be deleted after 90 days. Users can check on their captures' status via the  Captures app, where any images coming close to that 90 day limit will be flagged. 


As is apparent with this "new retention approach", Xbox users will need to ensure any captures they wish to keep for more than that 90 day period are backed up elsewhere or risk losing them forever.

Ryan - whose official job title is president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment - took charge of the PlayStation division back in February 2019, having previously helmed Sony Computer Interactive Europe.


In a statement announcing his retirement, Ryan wrote, "I've relished the opportunity to have a job I love in a very special company, working with great people and incredible partners. But I've found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew Meta Quest 3 was on the way after Meta made its latest consumer VR headset official back in June - just days ahead of Apple's Vision Pro reveal - but the company has now slapped it with a 10th October launch date, and pre-orders are open now.


April's initial unveiling confirmed some top-level features for Meta's new VR headset - which is now more accurately described as a mixed reality headset - but we now have a much clearer idea of the specs being packed into this third iteration of Quest.


Meta Quest 3 is powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor - which Meta says can manage "double the graphic processing" of Quest 2 - and it includes 8GB of RAM. It also sports two 120Hz LCD displays, each delivering a resolution of 2064 x 2208 - described as a 30 percent increase compared to Quest 2 - plus a 110-degrees horizontal and 96-degrees vertical field of view. Lenses have an adjustable IPD ranging from 58mm-71mm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you follow up a five-star treat like Dave the Diver? With a zombie-themed, 16-player PvPvE stealth-survival extraction game, of course! Developer Mintrocket has just unveiled its next project, titled Nakwon: Last Paradise, and it's about as much a departure from its acclaimed snorkelling-and-sushi-restaurant-management adventure as you can get, dropping players onto the streets of Seoul, right into the middle of the undead apocalypse.


As per Mintrocket's lengthy Steam announcement, Nakwon's action is split into two main parts; on the Scouting side, players - with a friend in tow if desired - must leave the relative comforts of the titular safe zone to venture into the zombie-infested outskirts of Seoul. Here, the goal is to scavenge resources then escape back to safety, but other players and, of course, the AI-controlled undead, won't make that an easy task. 


Mintrocket stresses that zombies in Nakwon are very much the hunters, and cannot be defeated. Instead, players - primarily armed with makeshift weaponry and tools rather than undead-shredding firepower, given the scarcity of guns - must navigate the streets as stealthily as possible to avoid detection, fleeing when necessary. And should they successfully make it back to the safe zone alive (it looks like players can come and go as they like, regardless of what other Survivors might be doing) the Simulation side of Nakwon begins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's promisingly outlandish Far Cry animated adaptation is almost upon us, with the series - titled Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix - set to hit the streaming service on 19th October. And ahead of its arrival, Netflix has shared a fresh trailer showcasing its chaotic action, this one welcoming Rayman and a bunch of other familiar Ubisoft faces.


Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix takes its cue from Ubisoft's gleefully ludicrous, 80s-inspired Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon. It's set in an alternate version of Earth's 1992 where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data.


Enter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before sailing off into the sunset with his boyfriend Alex. Unfortunately, Laserhawk is betrayed by said boyfriend, landing him in high-security facility with no choice but to join forces with an unlikely bunch of rebels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roughly two years after Netflix announced plans for a Tomb Raider anime, we've finally been given our first look at Lara Croft in cartoon action. 


The Tomb Raider animation is set to focus on the events following the reboot trilogy's conclusion. Lara has returned from her travels in South America, having prevented an apocalypse of some description, and is now ready for her next adventure. 


Netflix's debut trailer is quite brief, featuring a lot of heavy breathing from our heroine over the top of a handful of impactful shots. We get to see Lara abseiling into a cavernous abyss and - perhaps in homage to one of Shadow of the Tomb Raider's better moments - emerging onto the scene while a backdrop of flames silhouettes her (presumably) rather battle weary figure. There is also a nice little nod to the Yamatai crew from the 2013 reboot, with Lara tenderly stroking a photo of her fallen friends (although, no Alex? And, I know Jonah is still alive).

Five years on, and the streaming service has now given us a first look at the show, which is supposedly coming "soon".


Netflix's animated Devil May Cry series has been made in collaboration with Capcom, and comes from Studio Mir - the animation team behind the likes of The Legend of Korra and My Adventures with Superman.


Beyond that, details are almost entirely non-existent at present, although Netflix's announcement trailer does at least gives us a quick look at the adaptation's interpretation of Dante, who looks to be well and truly in "cocky pretty boy" mode for this outing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports earlier this year that Far Cry 7 is currently in the works at Ubisoft, story and gameplay details have emerged claiming the game will see players attempting to rescue their wealthy family, who've been kidnapped by a group calling itself the Sons of Truth.


That's according to Insider Gaming, who first reported news of Far Cry 7's development - later corroborated by Kotaku - back in January. Citing undisclosed "sources", the website says Far Cry 7, codenamed Project Blackbird, will feature a "non-linear" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.


Supposedly, the main goal of Far Cry 7 is to bring down the Sons of Truth, described as a "conspiracy group", within that time frame (the timer is said to stop while within certain locations, such as safehouses), but it's claimed players will also need to track down and rescue their family members along the way in order to "100%" the game.

Poncle hasn't laid all the specifics of Vampire Survivors new Chilling Update (also known as patch 1.7, and also also seemingly known as Whiteout), but its trailer drop came with confirmation it'll feature a brand-new wintery stage, complete with snow-covered pines and more snowmen than you can shake an arm-shaped stick at, plus a brand-new character.


As to the identity of this newcomer, I really couldn't say beyond the fact they have a fetching hood, based on the information currently available, but Poncle's new trailer does confirm patch 1.7 will introduce the Glass Fandango as a new weapon - "stronger with movement, Orologions, and against frozen enemies" - plus new achievements, and probably a bunch of other stuff I've missed because I have, alas, only recently begun my Vampire Survivors journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red has apologised for the Ukrainian localisation of Cyberpunk 2077 due to language which could be "considered offensive by Russian gamers" which was added in the 2.0 update last week and said it is working to add the "correct lines" in the next patch.

Website Zone of Games discovered differences between the English and Ukrainian scripts with altered dialogue. Since publishing its initial report, other differences within the versions of the game have surfaced.

As reported by our mates at Rock Paper Shotgun, the changes include swapping the word "asshole" to "rusnia", a Ukrainian derogatory word for Russians. The localisation also has allusions to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, such as a reference to "Russian warship, go fuck yourself", the response of a Ukrainian border guard to a Russian warship in a widely circulated encounter near Snake Island.

There are also extras available to subscribers for the newly-launched Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, plus other regular favourites such as Fall Guys and Pokémon Go.


Tango Gameworks' first-person action horror originally launched in 2022, and boasts a "spectacular, otherworldly atmosphere" according to Eurogamer's Ghostwire: Tokyo review, which simultaneously laid criticism on the game's combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced the Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition for PlayStation 5 next month and PC early next year. 
This edition of Aloy's latest escapades includes the base game and DLC Burning Shores, along with a selection of extras.


On PlayStation 5, the Complete Edition will launch on 6th October priced $60 / €60 / ¥7,980. I am assuming this will convert to roughly £55 here in the UK, but have emailed Sony to ask for clarification. 


The Complete Edition will then be available for PC players via Steam and Epic Game Store sometime in early 2024. This version is being handled by Nixxes Software, which was also responsible for this year's Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart PC release.

Speaking with the Financial Times, Guillemot looked back on Netflix's initial foray into streaming and noted the market's early scepticism. "Their shares fell a lot and they were widely criticised," he recalled. "Today, we see what they have become."


Guillemot said he believes the same will eventually ring true for video game streaming as well, but admitted it will likely take some time. "But when it takes off, it will happen very quickly," he said.

One of the latest discoveries is an arcade cabinet which lets you play a Doom and Wolfenstein inspired minigame called Arasaka Tower 3D. In it, you play as Johnny Silverhand descending the 120 floors of Arasaka Tower in 2023 after he stormed the building in a bomb attack on the corporation. 
Complete with Keanu Reeves' face at the bottom of the screen, tight corridors and downsampled tracks from Cyberpunk 2077's OST, it's got 90s FPS written all over it. That's not all though, as players have also discovered it relates to the long-running FF:06:B5 Easter egg present in other CD Projekt Red games.

<p>Rather than Apple, Google, and Citizen Lab coordinating and accurately reporting the common origin of the vulnerability, they chose to use a separate CVE designation, the researchers said. The researchers concluded that &#8220;millions of different applications&#8221; would remain vulnerable until they, too, incorporated the libwebp fix.

The Bethesda space RPG's many planets still feature environmental hazards, such as extreme temperatures and radiation. But the impact these have on your character is now fairly minimal - whereas previously this system would have seen players having to swap spacesuits to meet local conditions.


Bethesda boss Todd Howard revealed the change during an episode of the Game Maker's Notebook podcast, which is well worth a watch. In it, Howard discusses the challenges of creating interesting planets, fun space combat, and what changed during Starfield's development.

Prior to his departure in 2016, Metzen, who had been with Blizzard for 23 years at that point, was head writer and lore guru at the company (more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) with a hand in all the studio's properties.


Since rejoining Blizzard, however, Metzen has been solely focused on Warcraft (in the role of franchise creative advisor), and his new executive creative director position will continue in much the same vein, seeing Metzen focus exclusively on developing the Warfraft universe, initially with an eye on "crafting the next generation of [World of Warcraft] adventures.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 - which originally launched for PS4, Xbox One, and Epic back in September 2020 - combines remakes of developer Neversoft's much-loved skating games into a single, critically acclaimed package. The end result was an experience that thoroughly reinvigorated the two-decade old classics, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman even going as far as to call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 "one of the best games of the generation".


In the three years since its record-breaking release, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has made the jump to Switch, and developer Vicarious Visions (the esteemed studio responsible for the superb remakes) was merged into Blizzard - a move that sadly meant a planned Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 ultimately never saw the light of day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Talos Principle 2, Serious Sam studio Croteam's follow-up to its acclaimed 2014 first-person puzzle adventure, will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 2nd November.


The original Talos Principle served up an often fiendishly cerebral bout of puzzle-solving that played out something like Portal, albeit with a hell of a lot more lasers, a little bit of time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophy. Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle 'rooms' that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress.


As for The Talos Principle 2, it sounds like players can expect more of the same, and generally more all round. Croteam is promising new abilities, including gravity manipulation and mind transference, on top of the mechanics seen in the first game, and it'll all take place across "more than a dozen" new environments - said to be hiding long-buried secrets and forgotten history - that range from a city on the brink of a paradigm shift to the landscapes of a mysterious island.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, the supernatural action-RPG from Life is Strange studio Don't Nod, has been delayed to 13th February 2024 to avoid an "intense release cycle for AAA titles".


Banishers unfolds in the frozen North American wilderness, in the year 1695, where ghost hunters (and lovers) Antea Duarte and Red mac Rait are working to protect the living from the spectral dead. Their situation becomes somewhat more complicated when Antea suddenly finds herself unexpectedly dead and also a ghost.


Don't Nod and publisher Focus Entertainment had, as confirmed back in July, originally intended to release Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden on 7th November, but, in a short statement posted to Don't Nod's website today, Focus has now announced a three-month delay.

The information comes from reliable leaker Billbil-kun, who claims The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 will be added to the Essential tier of games for all PS Plus subscribers. 
The Callisto Protocol only came out in December last year, so this is a much cheaper way for those of you on PlayStation to play the game and try it out if you haven't bought it yet.

The game's listing on the App Store has the game available for free but with in-app purchases. Scrolling down, those purchases are listed in full with "Resident Evil 4 (with bonus)" priced at £57.99.


This is more expensive than as currently priced on Steam (£49.99) and PSN (£54.99), but similar to Xbox (£57.98). That's practically unheard of for a mobile game.

This slither comes from Craig Mazin, showrunner and co-creator of HBO's The Last of Us  adaptation, who has said work on season two will resume "the second" that strike action is officially lifted.


As a reminder, the Writers Guild of America has been on strike for almost five months. However, it was recently announced that a tentative agreement has been reached between the relevant parties for a new three-year contract, something that looks set to end the 146-day strike (thanks, Variety).

Nomura said he felt negatively towards the term, while Kitase was more accepting of its use to highlight the different approaches taken by Japanese game companies.


"I'm not too keen on it," Nomura told The Guardian in a new interview. "Certainly, when we started doing interviews for the games that I started making, no one used that term - they just called them RPGs. And then at some point - I can't remember exactly when - people started referring to them as JRPGs. And I'm not really sure what the intent behind that is. It just always felt a bit off to me, and a bit weird. I never really understood it - or why it's needed."

Of course, catching chocobo is nothing new for the series, but a new social post on X (formerly Twitter) from the game's official account shows how it'll work in Rebirth for the first time, with a video of Cloud catching one of the iconic yellow birds. 


The method actually looks similar to Breath of the Wild, with Cloud sneaking through foliage (and some conveniently spiky yellow flowers) and throwing out some greens as a distraction before mounting the bird.

As reported by PC Gamer, making a particular choice during one of the earlier story quests will lock you out of any future main quests. You can still explore Dogtown, but you won't get to spend time with Idris Elba. Why would you deprive yourself of that opportunity?

The choice which will lock you out is towards the end of Lucretia My Reflection, the fourth main quest. It's a fairly obvious one, but spoiler warning for below if you want to know exactly where it occurs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Nintendo Switch version of Red Dead Redemption 2 has shown up on the Brazilian ratings board's website.


As spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user necrolipe, Red Dead Redemption 2 has been rated for Nintendo Switch in Brazil. Eurogamer has since verified this listing, which also details other platforms the game is currently available on.


Developer Rockstar is yet to announce a Switch edition of its Wild West prequel, and it is unclear when the Brazilian ratings board updated its site to include this version. However, this recent revelation comes just one month after the studio added the first Red Dead game to the Nintendo Switch's library.

Ballots were cast by 34,687 members, with 98.32 percent in favour of strike authorisation on the Interactive Media Agreement that covers union members' work on video games.


While this does not guarantee the union will call a strike, the next bargaining session is this week, and this ratchets up the pressure. The leverage of this authorisation could compel movement on either side.

What a journey so far!
Starting from the initial blog post “How we made Kubernetes insanely easy to install” in September 2016, followed by an exciting growth that lead to general availability / “Production-Ready Kubernetes Cluster Creation with kubeadm” two years later.
And later on a continuous, steady and reliable flow of small improvements that is still going on as of today.
What is kubeadm? (quick refresher)
kubeadm is focused on bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters on existing infrastructure and performing an essential set of maintenance tasks. The core of the kubeadm interface is quite simple: new control plane nodes
are created by running kubeadm init and
worker nodes are joined to the control plane by running
kubeadm join.
Also included are utilities…]]></summary>

That tiny nugget of information comes via a new Ask me Anything (AMA) Q&A session, held earlier today on Reddit, in which Poncle occasionally had the opportunity to answer questions that weren't variations on 'Where the bloody hell are the vampires anyway, please?'.


One such question inquired if there were any multiplayer plans for Vampire Survivors beyond the four-player couch co-op mode introduced alongside the Switch release last month, to which Poncle replied in the affirmative.

This year's The Last of Us Day (which, if you're unfamiliar, happens on 26th September to commemorate the in-game date the Cordyceps infection reached critical mass) coincides with the series' tenth anniversary, meaning some fans were hoping developer Naughty Dog might have a few extra-special reveals to mark the occasion. 


Unfortunately, in a tweet clearly intended to manage expectations ahead of time, Naughty Dog wrote, "We're celebrating with a The Last of Us Day stream tomorrow... featuring announcements focused on art, merch, and more. While we're honouring the series' 10-year legacy, we will not be discussing any future game or TV show projects."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two weeks after getting its first small update, Starfield has just recieved another, this one focusing on performance and stability, as well as remedying a number of gameplay issues.


All-in-all, it's not a particularly glamorous update, equating to a grand total of ten bullet points in Bethesda's patch notes, but if you've been experiencing the likes of characters not appearing where they should be, blurry textures, or a hitch-y hand scanner, this one's for you.


Full patch details can be found below, and for those wondering when Bethesda might have something more substantial to bring to Starfield, the developer says it's "continuing to work on [the] larger update" that - as we learned a couple of weeks ago - will introduce the likes of Nvidia DLSS support and 32:9 ultrawide monitor support on PC, a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, and a new "Eat" button for food when it eventually arrives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a tumultuous week for Unity, in which the company infuriated a significant portion of the development community by making dramatic changes to its engine licensing terms - only to then partially walk them back - at least one developer has had enough, announcing it'll no longer be porting its acclaimed game to Switch as a direct consequence of Unity's actions.


Last Tuesday, Unity announced changes to its licensing agreement that would have forced developers to pay an additional fee every time a user installed their game. After significant outrage from the development community, with many accusing Unity of a betrayal of trust, the company changed course, saying its new pricing plan would now only apply to developers choosing to use its next Long Term Support version - but, as highlighted by developer Neognosis in a post announcing the cancellation of a Switch port for its acclaimed F-Zero-inspired racer BallisticNG, many developers might not have a choice but to upgrade.
 

"Nintendo has a rolling Unity version requirement for game releases," the studio explained, "and we're already behind the threshold by two years. Two weeks ago this wouldn't have been an issue... [but] by the time we'll have a Switch version of BallisticNG ready, the threshold for Unity versions will exceed the new versions that Unity are pushing their TOS changes with, and we currently have no confidence that they won't try pulling another move or pushing back to their original plans under/beyond this new TOS."

The lawsuit was filed on 8th July, as spotted by The Gamer, by a singular plaintiff on behalf of himself and class members, defined as "all persons in the State of California who purchased KOTOR for Nintendo during the relevant statute of limitations period, i.e. four years prior to the filing of the Complaint until present".


KOTOR 2 released on 8th June 2023 for Switch. It was initially advertised with plans to add a fan-made mod which restores content to the original game as DLC. On 3rd June 2023, Aspyr announced it was cancelling the Restored Content DLC and offered a "complimentary" key from a selection of other Star Wars games to those who had pre-purchased KOTOR 2.

Payday 3 was released on Thursday last week for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But as player numbers climbed, the game quickly got into problems. 


Now, in a statement issued this morning, the boss of Payday 3 developer Starbreeze said he was "disappointed" in how his company's big new launch had landed - and largely pointed the finger at an unnamed third-party matchmaking service for causing the game to fall over.

The kubeadm tool now supports etcd learner mode, which
allows you to enhance the resilience and stability
of your Kubernetes clusters by leveraging the learner mode
feature introduced in etcd version 3.4.
This guide will walk you through using etcd learner mode with kubeadm. By default, kubeadm runs
a local etcd instance on each control plane node.
In v1.27, kubeadm introduced a new feature gate EtcdLearnerMode. With this feature gate enabled,
when joining a new control plane node, a new etcd member will be created as a learner and
promoted to a voting member only after the etcd data are fully aligned.
What are the advantages of using etcd learner mode?
etcd learner mode offers several compelling reasons to consider its adoption

Despite recovering from persistent DDoS attacks that took down servers earlier this week, Destiny 2 is now experiencing a host of other errors and bugs, as well as possible further DDoS attacks that have players flocking to Bungie's social media channels to report in-game oddities.

As spotted by PCGN, the issues are numerous and wide-reaching, affecting everything from PvP scores to broken doors to enemies failing to see Guardians, let alone engaging with them.

As spotted by the fine folks at Gematsu, whilst the action horror game is free to download and lets anyone try out the opening sequences for free, you'll need ¥4990 – that's around £27 – to unlock the full game, and another ¥2000 (£11) to experience the "Winters' Expansion" DLC. 

And yes, the Resident Evil 4 Remake iDevice port is also still on track, too, although Capcom will only commit to a vague "2023" release. Unlike the older Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4 Remake will set you back ¥7990 (£44) and the newly-released DLC, Separate Ways, ¥1000 (£5.50). Again, you can download the game for free and give it a try before you buy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A CD Projekt Red developer has finally quashed the rumour that an NPC based upon Elon Musk was in the game at all, let alone recently removed. 

After a tweet purporting that CD Projekt had "removed the Elon Musk cameo from the Corpo opening in Cyberpunk 2077" went viral, senior quest designer Patrick Mills stepped in to ask, "who came up with this nonsense?".

"That wasn't Elon musk, it looks nothing like him. Who came up with this nonsense?" Mills asked.

After a three-day early access period for some players, Payday 3 released on 21st September, but players have struggled to get online at peak times due to continuing server issues that have shutdown matchmaking, making it impossible to play the always-online heist shooter.

On launch day, Starbreeze took to its social media accounts to admit that it was "currently experiencing slow matchmaking" and was "investigating and working on a solution".

The study, published in June edition of the journal <i>Papers in Palaeontology</i>, says the creature had a bullet-shaped body with luminous organs, eight arms and sucker attachments. The discovery was made by scientists in France, who used modern imaging technique to analyse the previously discovered fossils. The ancient squid has been named Vampyrofugiens atramentum, which stands for the &#8220;fleeing vampire&#8221;. The researchers said that these features have never been recorded before...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten days after Unity successfully enraged huge swathes of the development community by announcing sweeping, and wildly unpopular, changes to its Unity Engine business model, the company has said it's "sorry" and walked back on significant aspects of its new pricing plan.


Last Tuesday, Unity announced that, as of 1st January 2024, developers would be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install on top of their existing licence subscription after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash was immediate and intense, resulting in minor revisions to Unity's initial plan.


Now though, Unity's Marc Whitten has outlined significant changes to last week's announcement in a post on the company's website, beginning with another apology. "I want to start with this: I am sorry," he wrote. "We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback before announcing our new Runtime Fee policy. Our goal with this policy is to ensure we can continue to support you today and tomorrow, and keep deeply investing in our game engine."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Total War: Pharaoh next month, on 11th October, there's a bit of bad news - for some purchasers, at least: developer Creative Assembly has announced it's delaying the title into "early 2024", but only on the Epic Games Store.


It's a bit of an unusual one this, but Creative Assembly says the situation has arisen because it was "recently asked to help support the integration of social functions before we can launch on the Epic Games Store, and we'll need additional time to help make that happen".


Importantly, though, Total War: Pharaoh's 11th October release will remain unchanged on Steam - and all pre-orders made on Epic have been automatically cancelled, should you want to take your business elsewhere. Creative Assembly says all affected customers should receive an email confirming this cancellation directly from the Epic Games Store support team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has once again dropkicked the dreams right out of anyone hoping a whizzier, more powerful Steam Deck might be happening soon; it's now provided a clearer timeframe for what it considers to be the current Steam Deck's minimum life span, saying not to expect any kind of performance upgrade "in the next couple of years".


Valve has, of course, tempered expectations for a souped-up Steam Deck sequel previously; in December, Deck designer Pierre-Loup Griffais said the company would likely keep a single performance spec, ie. the current one, for its handheld gaming PC "a little bit longer", noting any initial hardware improvements would probably focus on screen and battery capacity.


But now, speaking to The Verge, Griffais has indicated that "little bit" will likely be a lot longer, and that any Steam Deck performance upgrades are still some considerable way off. "It's important to us that the Deck offers a fixed performance target for developers," he explained, "and that the message to customers is simple, where every Deck can play the same games."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you cast your minds back to 2020, you may recall Spider-Man being a hot topic of conversation. This was not because he had just used his web-tastic athleticism to save a school bus of children from careering off the side of the road, or swept MJ off her feet (literally) before kissing her while upside down. 


Rather, he was a topic of conversation because Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games remastered its original 2018 game for the PlayStation 5, and at the same time changed up the look of its unmasked hero, Peter Parker. 


While Insomniac said this new model was a better reflection of actor Yuri Lowenthal's facial capture, it caused a certain amount of upset for fans of the original. In fact, when the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man released last year, mods were made to bring Peter Parker's original face back into the game. But, perhaps we should all be less concerned about the two different facial models for Peter and move on. After all, that's what his actor wants. In fact, he just wants people to "get over it".

Players can now change their character's appearance by finding the Magic Mirror in camp. Everything other than race and subrace of your character can be altered - though it also can't be used to get rid of any "cosmetic modifications that are a consequence of your gameplay choices". Also, origin characters, hirelings and full illithids can't use the Magic Mirror.
Patch three has also added full support for the game on Mac, with Larian Studios recommending any players on Mac remove any mods and reinstall the game fresh before playing.

Scheduled to release in February 2024, Part 2 will debut its new storyline on Mars, a new location for Impact 3rd, which previously contained its galactic adventures on Earth and its moon. Previously thought uninhabitable in Honkai lore, Mars actually offers a "unique civilization and nature"  where "there may also be mysteries hidden behind the daily lives of residents that have yet to be discovered".
In addition to expanding its reach further into the solar system, Part 2 debuts a cast of "new partners from different cultures", introducing brand new main characters and NPCs alongside our shiny new playable character, a Martian native team supporter named Dreamseeker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Activision announced what players can expect in Season 6 of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone, The Haunting, which has a spooky theme just in time for Halloween.
A number of crossovers with other franchises are always to be expected, and this Season players will be able to purchase some horror (and horror adjacent) icons as Operators. 
Diablo's Lilith and Inarius (everybody's favourite Mother and Father from hell), He-Man nemesis Skeletor, Evil Dead's Ash Williams, and Alucard from the manga series Hellsing will all be entering the fray.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego has announced another Super Mario set - this time, a shelf-sized model of a Piranha Plant.


Measuring 23cm high by 11cm wide, the 540-piece design will launch in the UK on 6th November, at the comparatively affordable (for Lego) price of £58.


This is another of Lego's Super Mario range for older fans (albeit those still young at heart), rather than its kid-focused line of Super Mario sets which interact with its electronic Super Mario, Luigi and Peach toys.

On 29th September, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror will be available to play via the Game Boy Advance emulation service. You'll need a Switch Online subscription and the Expansion Pack to access it.
Kirby and the Amazing Mirror was released in 2004 for GBA and it tells the story of Kirby, who accidentally gets split into four different Kirbys, as he saves the Mirror World from dark corruption. The original release supported local multiplayer via Game Link Cable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A cosy new hobbit-based Lord of the Rings spinoff game has been teased by Wētā Workshop and Private Division. Yes, it is actually happening.


Tales of the Shire was announced to celebrate Hobbit Day, and promises to provide a snuggly "heart-warming" experience set in Tolkein's Middle-earth universe. It's coming from Wētā Workshop and Private Division and will arrive sometime next year. Needless to say, I am more than a little bit excited.


To accompany this announcement, a small teaser was also released. It is short and suitably charming, showing a young person humming as she sits at a table strewn with flora and art supplies. There are also modern bits and pieces, such as headphones. She is painting in a book, and while I have nothing to base this on other than my hunch, she looks to be painting herself as a hobbit. Could this be Tales of the Shire's soon to be pint-sized protagonist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a positive development for Microsoft, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has "provisionally concluded" the company's revised deal to purchase Activision Blizzard will be enough to grant approval.


Back in April, the CMA made the shock decision to block Microsoft's proposed deal to acquire the Call of Duty maker. At this time, the regulatory body cited concerns relating to the cloud gaming sector, stating that the deal risked "stifling competition in this growing market".


In August, Microsoft submitted a revised proposal in a bid to appease the regulator, saying it would now sell the streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard games released in the next 15 years to Ubisoft should the new deal be accepted.

News of The Division 3's existence comes not via a flashy announcement trailer or Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot bellowing the news through a megaphone while sat astride a glitter cannon, but instead tucked away in a press release announcing something else entirely.


Specifically, Ubisoft today disseminated a press release among news outlets announcing that Julian Gerighty - the creative director of next year's eagerly anticipated Star Wars Outlaws - has been appointed new executive producer of its Tom Clancy's The Division brand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seeing everything there is to see in developer Larian Studios' ludicrously vast Baldur's Gate 3 is already something of an impossible task, but Astarion actor Neil Newbon has now raised the stakes even higher, claiming it features a two-hour secret section that no-one's yet found.


During one of Newbon's regular Twitch livestreams, aired at the end of last month (thanks GamesRadar), the voice of everyone's favourite perfectly coiffured glampire teased that, "There's even something I know about that you can't get to unless you do something that I don't think anyone's going to work out".


Sadly, Newbon - who was told about the mysterious "two hours of content" in confidence and is likely "one of the few people that knows about it" - wouldn't even offer a "vague clue or hint" when asked. He did, however, tease that "at some point, somebody will find it for a very specific reason" - so it seems like getting to the bottom of this one will be squarely in the Baldur's Gate 3 community's court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its Tokyo Game Showcase, Capcom has shared nine minutes of new Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay footage, this time focusing on vocations - basically the series' version of classes - as well as offering a little look at some of the major locations in its world.


At the game's outset, Dragon's Dogma provides a choice between four vocations - fighter, mage, thief, and archer - each determining a player's style of play, but more will become available as events progress - and vocations can be changed by visiting Vocation Guilds, should you want to mix things up.


The fighter, for instance, specialises in one-handed sword and shield combat for short-range attacks and defensive manoeuvring. The archer, meanwhile, is better suited to taking down enemies - which are said to be behave organically out the world - from a distance using their bow and arrow, which can support the likes of exploding and blighting arrows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five and a half years and endless requests from the community later, Rare has announced it'll finally be adding private servers to Sea of Thieves - meaning a single crew of up to four players can explore the world without fear of PvP encounters - starting this December, as part of the multiplayer pirate adventure's Season 10.


Season 10 itself gets underway on 19th October, and will introduce a major new feature each month ahead of 2024 - essentially meaning all content originally planned for 2023 will arrive before the end of the year, despite a painfully protracted, seven-month-long Season 9.


First up, on 19th October, Sea of Thieves will introduce Guilds, described as a "new way for players to form meaningful bonds beyond their immediate crew". Essentially, any player that's reached Captain status and has their own ship can start a guild - picking a name, logo, and emblem when then do so - which can then support up to 24 invited players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Now, the latest free-to-play Pokémon Go-style augmented reality creature-battler from developer Niantic, made in collaboration with Capcom, has officially surpassed 5m downloads in its first week of release on iOS and Android.


Monster Hunter Now, which was announced back in February and got its full launch on 21st September following a series of closed beta tests, employs a similar real-world exploration and interaction system to the ones seen in the likes of Niantic's Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom, albeit with an obvious Monster Hunter twist.


Here, players are able to gather useful resources and fight monsters they encounter while out on their real-world travels - including the Barroth, Tobi Kadachi, Jyuratodus, Paolumu, Anjanath, Rathian, Rathalos, and Diablos - then combine their spoils to create better equipment that'll enable them to take on tougher challenges.

This upcoming release is a time-looping action game from Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro and Goichi "Suda51" Suda, two legends of game development. It promises to serve us all up some "2.5D slasher film parodic action".


So, what's it actually all about? Well, Hotel Barcelona is where America's serial killers have all decided to reconvene. And, according to the official trailer blurb, players will need to defeat this murderous bunch and "check out before all the blood is spilled".

This all stems from the game's description of its offline (and online) multiplayer, which originally read: "Paw it out with your friends both online and offline".


But Party Animals does not have an offline mode. As a result, many owners have left negative comments about the release.

It also revealed email exchanges between Microsoft's execs, where Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond and others discussed potential games for the company's Game Pass subscription service. 


One such game was Baldur's Gate 3, the recent hit from developer Larian. As we previously reported, Microsoft estimated it would take $5m to get Baldur's Gate 3 on Game Pass, with the company dubbing the game a "second-run Stadia PC RPG".


Needless to say, given the huge success of Baldur's Gate 3, Microsoft underestimated its potential. But Larian isn't mad about this. Rather, it has said it understands the situation, with the studio's director of publishing Michael Douse saying it "comes with the genre".

Sea of Thieves' three-part The Legend of Monkey Island adventure got underway back in July, sending players on a quest to Mêlée Island where, thanks to the mysterious power of the Sea of the Damned, Guybrush Threepwood had become the mightiest pirate of all. It was a wonderful opening episode, managing to capture the magic (if perhaps not the humour) of the point-and-click classic, and things only got better in last month's vastly more open-ended part two.


Episode three, titled The Lair of LeChuck, whisks players away to an absolutely gorgeous rendition of Monkey Island itself - which you can see a bit of at the 4:49 mark in Sea of Thieves' latest news update below - spanning everything from dense jungle to lava-filled catacombs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glen Schofield, the co-creator of Dead Space, is departing his Striking Distance Studios following the commercial failure of its first game, sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol. 


Schofield founded Striking Distance Studios in 2019, under the wing of a Korean publisher Krafton Inc., which was looking to create a narrative-based game that would expand its PUBG: Battlegrounds universe - although, notably, all connections to PUBG had been excised by the time The Callisto Protocol launched in December last year.


Unfortunately, The Callisto Protocol's critical reception was mixed and the game was met with lower-than-anticipated sales. In January, it was reported that Krafton had expected to shift five million copies of The Callisto Protocol - whose three-year development had cost it £132m - but that it was unlikely to hit its target, given just two million copies had been sold at the time.

Crystal Dynamics' communications director Adam Kahn also confirmed he'd been affected by today's layoffs, as did senior community and social media manager Neha Nair. "After 3.5 years at Crystal Dynamics," Nair wrote, "I was laid off today."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the surprise news that Paradox Interactive's beleaguered Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is now in the hands of  Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs studio The Chinese Room, the developer has talked a little about its goals for the rejuvenated project, saying it's building its action around 'doing things only a vampire can'.


Bloodlines 2 has, of course, had a tumultuous journey since its unveiling back in 2019; original developer Hardsuit Labs was ditched following a number of controversies, almost resulting in the cancellation of the game, but Paradox eventually confirmed development had been handed to a new studio, now known to be The Chinese Room, sometime in 2021.


Bloodlines 2's re-reveal earlier this month was fairly light on detail, but Paradox did say the game would cast players as an Elder vampire in the "dark underbelly of Seattle, where vampires struggle for survival and supremacy". It also confirmed there'd be characters for players to chat with, combat, a need to keep a low profile to ensure vampire society stays hidden from humanity, and "complex political relationships".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UK regulatory body the Competition and Markets Authority is reportedly preparing to share its preliminary judgement on Microsoft's revised Activision Blizzard deal next week.


The CMA is, of course, Microsoft's last remaining hurdle in getting its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard over the finish line after the UK regulator made the shock decision to block the deal in April, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk "stifling competition in this growing market". 


Following the CMA's decision - and the Federal Trade Commission's failure to secure a temporary halt on the deal in a US court - Microsoft returned to the UK regulator with a revised proposal, saying it would sell the streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard games released in the next 15 years to Ubisoft should the new deal be approved.

A smaller "core group" within Criterion will continue on with Need for Speed, meanwhile.


Criterion has of course worked on Battlefield before, and contributed bits to DICE's Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 (it also helped out on Star Wars Battlefront 2). The talented team will now turn its efforts back to improving 2042, and to the future of the Battlefield franchise overall.

The adaptation was revealed a year ago byCapcom, along with a few stills from the show. Its protagonist is Musashi Miyamoto, whose likeness is modelled after prolific Japanese actor Mifune Toshiro (best known for his roles in Akira Kurosawa's films including Seven Samurai). The series is directed by Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer, 13 Assassins).

The new trailer shows snippets of action sequences and reveals hints of the plot. Netflix describes the first episode as "the beginning of an intense series full of realistic action in which Musashi's blade slices through evil as he traverses a land plagued by poverty".

Thanks to the huge leak of documents accidentally uploaded by Microsoft to the US FTC, we now know why the PS5 version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon was released later than its Xbox next-gen counterparts. 
In a series of emails dated 1st June 2020, Xbox execs Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond, and Damon Baker (who has since left Microsoft and joined publisher Kepler Interactive) discuss how the company essentially ended up with a timed exclusive on next-gen consoles thanks to a number of caveats with certain deals struck between itself, Sega and Sony.

Re-Logic does not even use Unity, but in a statement via X (formerly Twitter) the developer said it felt it "cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere".


Godot and FNA will receive $100k each, and Re-Logic will also continue sponsoring both with a further $1k per month. "All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere," said Re-Logic.

Bluey the cartoon follows the adventures of the eponymous Blue Heeler dog, her sister Bingo, mum Chilli, and dad Bandit. All are along for the ride in Bluey: The Videogame, which promises an "interactive sandbox adventure" for up to four players, featuring fully explorable recreations of some of the show's most recognisable locations.


There's talk of "story-driven episodic gameplay", split into four parts, that'll include activities and mini-games inspired by the cartoon - Keepy Uppy and Magic Xylophone are mentioned - with players able to unlock new costumes, stickers, episodes, and locations as they go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saber Interactive has announced it's ending development of last year's Evil Dead: The Game - meaning no new content will be produced and the planned Switch version is now cancelled.


Evil Dead: The Game - which launched onto Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last May - is another entry in the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre that's already bought us the likes of Dead by Daylight and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this one pitting a cast of familiar faces from the Evil Dead movies, including Bruce Campbell's Ash Williams, against the Deadite hordes.


Since its release, sporadic post-launch support has introduced a castle map inspired by Army of Darkness, new outfits, a number of characters, the new Plaguebringer class, and a new Splatter Royale mode. April saw the previously Epic Games Store-exclusive title make the jump to Steam on PC, but content updates fizzled out after that - and now Saber Interactive has confirmed development has reached its end.

"Today, several documents submitted in the court proceedings related to our proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard were unintentionally disclosed. I know this is disappointing, even if many of the documents are well over a year old and our plans have evolved.


"I also know we all take the confidentiality of our plans and our partners’ information very seriously. This leak obviously is not us living up to that expectation. We will learn from what happened and be better going forward. We all put incredible amounts of passion and energy into our work, and this is never how we want that hard work to be shared with the community. That said, there’s so much more to be excited about, and when we’re ready, we’ll share the real plans with our players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following today's mega-sized Xbox leak - which has given us word of a planned digital-only Xbox Series X/S refresh and new controller, a tantalising Bethesda release roadmap, first details of a brand-new Xbox in 2028, confirmation Xbox boss Phil Spencer is awfully keen to buy Nintendo, and more - the US Federal Trade Commission has stepped forward to quell any bubbling conspiracy theories and emphatically state it was not responsible (it was Microsoft).


Today's barrage of Xbox news all came from confidential Xbox documents, dated April 2022, that were originally shared by Microsoft as part of the FTC's case against the company's proposed $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. These documents then surfaced publicly last night, providing access to a treasure trove of fully unredacted internal details.


Predictably, internet conspiracy theories have ebbed and flowed throughout to the day regarding who might be have been responsible for the leak and why - but the FTC has moved to make it abundantly clear it wasn't involved, begining with a statement from Douglas Farrar, the commission's office of public affairs director, on social media.

So while we must sadly bid a fond farewell to the publisher's eye-catching Tekken 8 CNT graphic, we do at least get to snicker at its replacement (I'm assuming nobody at Bandai Namco thought to run 'CBT' through the internet first either) when the next bout of testing gets underway at 8am BST on 20th October. Proceedings will run until 9am on 23rd October, with three hours of downtime scheduled between 9am and 12pm on the 21st.


Once again, players across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Steam can get involved (Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus subscriptions are not required), and once again places are limited, so those interested in participating will need to register their interest beforehand. Registration closes at 8am on 11th October and successful applicants will be notified starting at 8am on the 18th. Additionally, Bandai Namco notes successful CNT entrants can play without re-registering.

For instance, Microsoft estimated it would take $300m to get Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on Game Pass, or $250m for either Mortal Kombat 1 or Suicide Squad.


As we reported earlier today, a 2022 email thread initiated by Phil Spencer had Microsoft scrambling to fill the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield's delay and included a long list of potential third-party games.

The ability to switch between Peter and Miles is a new addition for this sequel and switching characters will be "almost" instantaneous. But what happens to the other character that you're not controlling in the open world?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French President Emmanuel Macron has clarified his view on video games after previously blaming recent riots on the culture of video games.


Now, in a new statement on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said he startled gamers - or, he literally "made the gamers jump" - with his words and that really he "always considered that video games are an opportunity for France, for our youth and its future, for our jobs and our economy".


He continued: "I expressed my concerns at the end of June because video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks. It is this violence that I condemn, not video games.

First up, Nintendo's Japanese web page for the game states that two sets of courses will be added. The first will be in late September and taken from the Queen League; the second will be mid-October and from the King League.



At present, the courses in the game are mainly taken from the Knight League, so expect some trickier races in the near future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're discussing what feels like the biggest leak of Xbox gaming news in history, which has left Microsoft's plans to launch new hardware in 2024 and a new console generation in 2028 exposed. 
Next year's redesigned Xbox Series X is digital only, according to documents from 2022 that Microsoft presented to the FTC this year. It does not appear to boast a bump in processing power - something that gels with what Xbox boss Phil Spencer told me at Gamescom last month - but also ditches the ability to play older games on disc. How does that square with Microsoft's push for game preservation?
Looking further ahead, Microsoft has pinned 2028 as the year we'll finally see the Xbox Series X's proper successor arrive. Is that too late? And what does it mean that the console will support "cloud hybrid" games?

The document shared this time was a flight manual for the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, Niche Gamer reported. Information such as sensor locations, firing angles, and engine specifications were shown on the pages circulated on the thread.
The entire thread has since been deleted, though developer Gaijin Entertainment confirmed the information had been posted onto its forum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phil Spencer admitted the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield's delay was a "disaster situation" and suggested FromSoftware's Dark Souls games to plug the gap following the success of Elden Ring, among other third-party releases.


Today's enormous leak of internal Microsoft documents includes a particularly candid email from Spencer sent in May 2022, revealing his frustration around "a huge hole with our games lineup". That was due to Starfield's delay, "not a tonne of clarity on the launch date of Redfall", and Stalker 2 development impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.


"We keep talking about a big AAA a quarter in the service [Game Pass] and it feels like we are likely to go through a gap of almost 16 months between big exclusive launches on our platform," Spencer lamented.

"We're investigating the problem," Larian continued, via a post on X, formerly Twitter. "But for now, the workaround is to disconnet your PS5 from the internet."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadows of Doubt, the ambitious procedural detective noir sandbox from developer Cole Jefferies, is introducing new cases themed around infidelity on 25th September, as part of its first major update since entering Steam early access in April.


Shadows of Doubt, for those in need of a quick refresher, is a first-person, open-world detective sim set in a noirish sci-fi city. Its unique selling point, however, is that procedural generation governs virtually every aspect of it in a bid to create an endlessly replayable crime-solving caper - from the layout of its city streets to the schedules of its citizens, right through to the cases you'll need to solve through stealth, subtrefuge, and sleuthing.


And from next Monday, 25th September, come the arrival of its Cheats and Liars update, Shadows of Doubt will have another trick in its toolbox - as players might just find themselves asked to investigate cases of infidelity, should it suit the procedural generation's whims.

In terms of decor, you get counters, cabinets, and matching home appliances (oven, fridge, and dishwasher to be specific), all taking a cue from European designs, while the new small appliances come in the form of a Stand Mixer, Waffle Maker, and Countertop Pizza Oven - the latter also capable of cooking focaccia bread if pizza isn't your thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week after Unity announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model - drawing immediate and widespread condemnation from the development community - the company has reportedly told staff it'll be making adjustments to the controversial new pricing plan.


As reported by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, Unity leadership addressed employees in an all-hands meeting held earlier today (a meeting originally planned for late last week was cancelled following a "potential threat" from an employee), saying the company was "considering" introducing a cap on its hugely unpopular new per-install fees.


Unity initially caused an outcry last Tuesday, when it told developers that, on top of their existing Unity Engine licence subscription, they'd be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee each time a user installed their game, starting on 1st January 2024. This would apply to all games, including those already on the market, that had made $200k USD or more in the last 12 months and had at least 200k lifetime game installs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In news that isn't likely to be much of a surprise to anyone at this point, a newly unearthed Microsoft court document has confirmed The Elder Scrolls 6 won't be making its way to PlayStation when it eventually shows up in 2026 or beyond.


Microsoft submitted the document (thanks The Verge) as part of its court battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard - the same court proceedings that saw Xbox boss Phil Spencer answer an FTC attorney's questions about The Elder Scrolls 6's Xbox exclusivity by saying, "I think we've been a little unclear on what platforms it's launching on, given how far out the game is. It's difficult for us right now to nail down... It's so far out it's hard to understand what the platforms will even be at this point."


Despite Spencer's noncommital answer back in June, Microsoft's newly released court documents make it explicitly clear The Elder Scrolls 6 won't be coming to a PlayStation console.

Emails between Activision executives - made public as part of the FTC's court case with Microsoft and published today by The Verge, albeit with many redactions - show that the company's controversial boss Bobby Kotick spoke with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa about Switch 2 at the end of 2022.


Activision exec Chris Schnakenberg noted that the console was expected to be weigh in with a "closer alignment to Gen 8 platforms in terms of performance", referring to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles.

It's undoubtedly become a milestone of recent gaming history, driven by an impressive figure of over 160m lifetime sales, critical reception, and endless controversies from developer Rockstar Games and its parent company Take-Two. The popular multiplayer mode, GTA Online, continues to stand the test of time as Rockstar continually adds new updates and content. 


As Rockstar works on GTA 6 and Take-Two suggests it might be released as early as next year, now feels like an appropriate moment to take stock of the achievements, missteps, and musings that surround GTA 5.

In fact, the version available on Nintendo's hybrid console has been widely panned, with many wondering how the developer can ask the same price on Switch as on other platforms. 


Fans have taken to the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok to question NetherRealm's decision to market Mortal Kombat 1 as a $70 Switch release. It has been called "robbery" and "disrespectful" to users.

This morning, Unity said it was sorry for the "confusion and angst" its changes had caused, and promised it would make unspecified "changes" to its plans.

For a long time, however, very little was done for Titanfall 2's small but dedicated fanbase, but now it seems Respawn has not only addressed the server issues, but also got Titanfall fans excited that something new may be on the horizon, too.

"As of now, 15 September 2023, the comic book property called Fables, including all related Fables spin-offs and characters, is now in the public domain," Willingham wrote on his substack. "What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time. It’s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible."

Wondering why Willingham has done this? You're not alone. The author said he's made the decision to move everything into the public domain for "a number of reasons", including "practicality" – Willingham feels much has changed since he first signed his contract with DC Comics – and "philosophy", as his "thoughts on how to reform the trademark and copyright laws in this country (and others, I suppose) have undergone something of a radical transformation".

Just like Skyrim's old infinite money glitch, players have found a sneaky way to rob the Shepherd's General Store if they're in third-person and situate themselves just-so in front of a very unassuming puddle.

"WOW," YouTuber JamieMoranUK posted to X/Twitter. "If you go to Akila City, look in a puddle in front of the store, Shepherds. You can get all the store's inventory for FREE.

Sony's newly announced Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue, and Sterling Silver cover/controller combos are, according to a post on the PlayStation Blog, inspired by the "beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth" - all of which have then bee "elevated" with a metallic finish for a "touch of sophistication."


Those interested in giving their PS5 a "Deep Earth" makeover can, when the appropriate time comes, pick up each of the three shiny new covers for £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 USD, while the DualSense controllers (sold separately) will each cost £64.99/€74.99/$74.99 USD.

This year, though, it's going in completely the opposite direction, and its recently launched WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker will be getting even more nerve-frayingly horrifying, just in time for Halloween.


As spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun, Frictional's creative lead Fredrik Olsson has recently been using social media to detail some of the delightfully sadistic new features coming to Amnesia: The Bunker soon in what will known as Shell Shocked mode.


For starters, players who've been relying on the comparative tranquility of The Bunker's Admin Office safe room to emotionally, physically, and mentally regroup will, in Shell Shocked mode, be a little bit screwed. Now, its reassuringly sturdy steel doors will be replaced wood, which, you know, isn't all that resistant to scrambling, pounding, shredding monster claws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Montreal - the studio behind the likes of Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Far Cry 5 - has been accused of leaving staff in "turmoil" after it reportedly reneged on promises that "100% remote work would be possible", forcing all 4,000 of its workers back to the office for a "minimum" of two days a week, as of 11th September.


Back in June 2021, Ubisoft announced it would be adopting a "hybrid and tailored approach to work arrangements" where staff would be able "to balance in-office work with work from home". However, according to a new report by IGN, Ubisoft Montreal staff were repeatedly told they could remain 100% remote long-term, leading many to make significant life decision or accept jobs at the company based around these assurances.


"100% remote work will be possible depending on various criteria," reads an internal Ubisoft document seen by IGN and detailed in its report, "such as productivity and impact on the team, as well as the nature of the work being done."

This marks something of an interesting (I realise your mileage may vary on this point) deviation for SCS, which has so far been making its way across the US map in a bottom-to-top, left-to-right fashion, starting with California. This latest news means once Kansas and Nebraska are released, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Louisiana will be missing from the expected progression.


Arkansas, the so-called Natural State (mine is "asleep"), will be American Truck Simulator's 16th state when it arrives at some currently undisclosed future point, and SCS Software's rendition promises everything from "stunning mountain vistas to towering forests".

A new release date trailer for the game was shown at last night's PlayStation State of Play, which included a shot of Cloud and Sephiroth together in battle. In a follow-up interview on the PlayStation Blog, creative director Tetsuya Nomura confirmed Sephiroth will be playable.


"If you played the original Final Fantasy 7, I'm sure you can guess which scene I'm talking about," he said. "You will be able to control Sephiroth in the same scene in this title as you did in the original."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As revealed in PlayStation's recent State of Play, Honaki: Star Rail is coming to PS5 on 11th October, 2023.


Developed by HoYoverse, the company behind Genshin Impact, Star Rail is an anime-styled turn-based RPG with a gacha system, and has already been in the hands of PC and mobile players for five months.


While Star Rail is a free download, you can purchase its PS5 "pre-order" bundle for £9.49 to get some in-game items when it releases, and the ability to pre-download the game on PS5. But these in-game items are fairly unhelpful in the grand scheme of getting and building characters, especially when compared to its battle pass, the "Nameless Honor", which upgrades its free track to premium for £9.99 and offers far more helpful materials and weapons.

We've had a couple of glimpses of Rebirth since its announcement back in June 2022, and we know it'll unsurprisingly be picking up the story from 2020's Final Fantasy 7 Remake and later InterMISSION DLC - although "preparations" are being made to help you catch up if you can't be bothered to play through either of those beforehand.


"After escaping from the dystopian city of Midgar," developer Square Enix explains, "Cloud and his friends set out on a journey across the planet. New adventures await in a vibrant and vast world – sprint across grassy plains on a Chocobo and explore expansive environments."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During this evening's Sony State of Play, Insomniac Games revealed some more information about next month's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ahead of its release on 20th October.

The game's map has almost doubled in size, with the addition of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City. To help Peter and Miles swing across the larger map, they can now use web wings to traverse faster. The game uses a new fast travel system which is unlocked through the district progress systesm, and Insomniac says players will experience "very little downtime" when using fast travel.
The HUD for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 looks more organic, as markers for activities and quests players have already discovered will appear across New York City. This is explained in-game as AR technology in the lenses of the Spider-Masks which, given the technology already used by characters in the Spider-Man universe, Peter and Miles probably sorely need.

Separate Ways, if you're unfamiliar, was introduced to Resident Evil 4 when the game made the jump from GameCube to PlayStation 2 in 2005. It focuses on enigmatic spy Ada Wong, who briefly pops up in the Leon S. Kennedy-starring main campaign - filling in the blanks of her whereabouts over the course of the story.


A Resident Evil 4 Remake version of Separate Ways was first spotted by dataminer Gosetsu back in March, and Capcom has now made it official, confirming it'll release for $9.99 USD - alongside a free update to Resident Evil 4's wave-based Mercenaries mode introducing Ada Wong and Albert Wesker - on 21st September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big times are coming for Cyberpunk 2077, with its paid expansion and a significant 2.0 base game overhaul both right around the corner; we already knew the expansion, Phantom Liberty, was coming on 26th September, but developer CD Projekt has now confirmed its free 2.0 update will arrive five days earlier, on 21st September.


Cyberpunk 2.0 aims to address some of the criticism levied at the game since its controversial launch at the tail-end of 2020, promising completely redesigned skill trees and perks, revamped cyberware, a new capacity system, vehicle combat and car chases, combat AI improvements, and a new police system. It also brings changes to loot, items, and crafting, as well as UI and UX improvements, and a new selection of radio stations.


In other words, Cyberpunk's 2.0 update touches on a broad range of core systems in a significant fashion - and CD Projekt has been attempting to explain how these changes will impact the experience across a recent series of developer streams.

Today's State of Play is focused on "previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles", including PlayStation VR2, Sony said yesterday - so don't expect any big new reveals. Specifically, these will be for third-party games - so don't plan for any of Sony's own internal studios to pop up either. 


There's still plenty that could feature, though - including Square Enix games such as Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth and also Foamstars. What are you hoping to see?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of its hugely controversial engine pricing changes, Unity has closed a number of its offices over what it has called a "potential threat".


News of the temporary closures first began circulating earlier today as Unity employees shared the news on social media. "Hey y'all, just a reminder to think before you target Unity employees," senior XR product designer Javier Busto wrote. "This morning we learned that law enforcement notified several Unity offices of credible threats."


Bloomberg's Jason Schreier later elaborated on those initial reports, writing that a "credible death threat" had resulted in the closer of two Unity offices - in San Francisco and Austin, Texas - as well as the cancellation of a town hall meeting that would have seen Unity CEO John Riccitiello addressing staff following Tuesday's widely lambasted pricing changes.

MobileGamer sources say Unity has already offered some studios a 100% fee waiver - if they switch over to Unity's own LevelPlay ad platform. 


The report quotes industry consultants that say this move is an "attempt to destroy" Unity's main competitior in this field: AppLovin.

The Direct's line-up, including an F-Zero 99 announcement,  and big finale, a port of the beloved Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, were fan-pleasing additions to the Switch's bulging catalogue.


And they are perhaps the kind of smaller announcements we'd expect at this point, for a platform widely-expected to be replaced next year. Still, as we saw, there's plenty of life left for the next six months at least - and beyond?

A enhanced version of Luigi's Mansion 2 (originally titled Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon when it launched for 3DS back in 2013) was initially unveiled in June, but today's Nintendo Direct offered a substantially longer look at its spooky ghost-hoovering action.


The twist in Luigi's Mansion 2, if you're unfamiliar with the original, is that it plays out across not just one ghost-infested haunted dwelling, but five - starting with the kind of classic spook house seen in its GameCube predecessor, and continuing through the likes of a former research lab, run-down clock factory, snowy mine, and more.

The goal each level is to retrieve a key and get it to the exit, requiring both observation and brain work to navigate the obstacles using levers, platforms, and other wrinkles to grab the mini-Marios and progress to the next area.

Mega Crit pledged to ditch Unity as the engine for its next game - a project it has already poured two years of work into - if Unity does not back down over its hugely unpopular decision.

Asmussen, whose career in the games industry spans close to 25 years, worked on all three original God of War titles at Santa Monica Studio prior to his move to Respawn - serving as lead environment artist, then art director, and, finally, creative director on God of War 3. 


He joined Respawn Entertainment as a game director in 2014, and his first released project at the studio was 2019's well-received Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. A follow-up, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, also helmed by Asmussen, released earlier this year, proving to be a commercial hit.

Proceedings get underway at 6pm in the UK/1pm EDT, and viewers can expect around an hour of chat - which will include "on-the-horizon news and updates" - covering both Minecraft and this year's action-strategy spin-off, Minecraft: Legends.


As for this year's community mob vote (mobs, if you're unfamiliar with Minecraft parlance, are basically enemies), it'll offer a choice between three new mobs - which Mojang will reveal at the "beginning of October" - and take place via the Minecraft Launcher, Minecraft.net, or the special event server on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

As detailed on Bethesda's website, the studio is initially targeting a "few top issues" in a small hotfix out today, after which it'll be turning its attention to various community requested features, which will arrive in updates at a "regular interval".


Specifically, it's confirmed Nvidia DLSS Support on PC following its controversial partnership with AMD, as well as 32:9 ultrawide monitor support on the platform. Additionally, players can expect a range of quality of life improvements, including a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, plus brightness and contrast controls. Oh, and also, more convenient, efficient consumption through the power of a new "Eat" button for food.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new PS5 update will allow players to assign a second controller as an assist.


This is an accessibility feature to allow two controllers to be used at once, meaning players can help others by playing games collaboratively.


This is just one of a suite of features as part of this new update, which is available to download today globally. Another is the addition of support for larger-capacity SSDs  - now up to 8TB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity executives sold thousands of shares in the weeks leading up to last night's hugely controversial announcement it will soon charge developers when one of their games is downloaded.

The company has subsequently softened its stance slightly on a couple of aspects - but fury across the industry remains.

Behind the scenes, CEO John Riccitiello shifted 2000 shares last week on 6th September, as noted by Yahoo Finance, which noted this move was part of a trend over the past year where the exec has sold more than 50,000 shares in total and bought none.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent Square Enix games have misfired due to the approach of each game being "a single producer's fiefdom".


That's according to a new report from Bloomberg, detailing a recent drop in stock value of the company compared to its closest rival Capcom, though stock over the past couple of years has fluctuated but appears relatively stable. It's claimed this recent drop is due to underwhelming sales of Final Fantasy 16, though it also follows the disappointing Forspoken and a number of smaller games released at the tail-end of last year that failed to make much of an impression.


Bloomberg sources include current and former Square Enix employees who remain anonymous, but stated the company's approach is to give each project a single producer.

Unity shared a blog post detailing plans of a new business model where a monthly fee per new game install will be set from 1st January next year. In a statement following the blog post, the game engine creator insisted the change will "only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users".


However, a huge number of games are built using Unity tools, so the reaction to this change has been met with widespread criticism.

Unity told Axios last night it had "regrouped" to further discuss some of the issues raised by game developers, and made some concessions.


Initially, Unity planned to charge game developers a small fee every time a user installed a Unity game (beginning at the start of 2024, subject to the project meeting certain thresholds). Now, Unity said, this charge would only come after a user first installed a game.

Belle will be accompanied by her furry boyfriend Beast, and both will be introduced though a new Realm adventure set in the Beast's castle, with new Friendship Quests and items becoming available once the pair move village-ward.


Additionally, players who've been progressing through Dreamlight Valley's overarching story will be able to settle The Forgotten into the Valley over a series of quests, and - good news for the completionists out their (hello, it's me) - the spooky candy event is back from 24th October to 1st November, meaning you can tidy up any seasonal Dreamlight Duties you missed last year.

The beauty of this feature is that:
it is trivial to adopt (you just need to set a bool in the pod spec)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has launched another of its Behind the Sims showcases at the internet, this one bringing confirmation that The Sims 5 - or codename Project Rene as it's officially known at present - will indeed be a free-to-play game, as previously leaked, and will coexist alongside The Sims 4. Oh, and there was also some news on The Sims 4's first Stuff Pack in over two-and-a-half years.


First, though, Project Rene and the news it'll definitely be free-to-play - or as EA is more insistently phrasing it, "free-to-download". Either way, the important thing here is that no core game purchase will be required, and EA is also keen to add there'll be no subscription and no "energy mechanics" - so that's at least one predatory mobile monetisation tactic off the table.


As to what a new mainline Sims game designed from the ground-up to be free-to-play might look like, a Project Rene job listing hastily removed from EA's website earlier this year pointed to an in-game marketplace featuring official and user-generated content (both free and paid) - something else EA has now more or less confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has revealed its new iPhone 15 line-up, bringing the news that its ray-tracing-enabled iPhone 15 Pro will be getting native versions of some AAA titles - including Capcom's Resident Evil 4 Remake and Ubisoft's upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage - over the next 12 months.


The newly unveiled iPhone 15 starts at £799 with 128GB storage, and features a 6.1" Super Retina XDR display (bumped up to 6.7" if you opt for the £899 "Plus" model), an aluminium body, the A16 Bionic Chip with 5-core GPU, and a 4x optical dual camera system capable of taking photos at up to 48MP. It'll also ditch Apple's proprietary Lighting port in favour of USB-C to comply with upcoming EU regulations. 


The pricier iPhone 15 Pro model (starting at £999 with 128GB storage) is where things get a little more interesting for gaming. Its specs are broadly similar to the standard model (the £1,199 Pro Max even has the 6.7" screen), but it switches in a 10x optical "telephoto" camera zoom, titanium body, and the A17 Pro chip with 6-core GPU.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model which will see it introduce a monthly fee per new game install beginning on 1st January next year - a move that has drawn considerable criticism from the development community.


Unity - the engine behind countless acclaimed games including Tunic, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Citizen Sleeper, RimWorld, Outer Wilds, Fall Guys, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Cities: Skylines - was previously licenced to developers using a royalty free model built around subscription tiers. Anyone whose revenue or funding was less than $100k over the course of the year (and who didn't want access to features such as the ability to remove the Unity splash screen) could stick to the free Unity Personal licence, while a Unity Plus subscription was required up to $200k in revenue, and a Unity Pro or above subscription was needed for more.


As of 1st January, 2024, however, developers will be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install - seemingly including re-installs and installs across multiple devices - on top of their existing licence subscription, with those fees kicking in for titles that have made $200k or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200k lifetime game installs. Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers, meanwhile, will see the fees applied after passing the $1m revenue and 1m lifetime installs threshold.

More information on what fans can expect is "coming soon", as stated in the announcements from The Pokémon Company, though the teaser video for the event has some glimpses of what we might see. 
Pikachu and Eevee are shown running through a field of sunflowers, against a backdrop of countryside and windmills, before the animation transforms into the art style of an oil painting with Vincent Van Gogh's signature brush strokes. Pikachu and Eevee turn to see the sunflowers have all turned into beaming Sunflora, and then we get a quick look at Van Gogh's famous Sunflowers painting but with Sunflora taking centre stage.

And, like a reluctant DM, the game will warn you if you're about to do something very silly, before watching you do the very silly thing and then say "I warned you".
In Act 3, there are some important items required for the main storyline. You're not supposed to get rid of these and there are some restrictions in place to prevent players from losing one of them, but as BOB_BestOfBugs on YouTube has discovered, that won't stop a resourceful D&D player. 
Warning: This article contains story spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3, so turn back now to avoid those. Perhaps you'd prefer to read our combat tips guide or check out Digital Foundry's impressions of the game on PS5 instead!

The Kubernetes development cycle is an evolving landscape with a myriad of tools seeking to streamline the process. Each tool has its unique approach, and the choice often comes down to individual project requirements, the team's expertise, and the preferred workflow.
Among the various solutions, a category we dubbed “Local K8S Development tools” has emerged, which seeks to enhance the Kubernetes development experience by connecting locally running components to the Kubernetes cluster. This facilitates rapid testing of new code in cloud conditions, circumventing the traditional cycle of Dockerization, CI, and deployment.
In this post, we compare three solutions in this category: Telepresence, Gefyra, and our own contender, mirrord.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XDefiant, the Tom-Clancy-adjacent free-to-play shooter from Ubisoft, has been delayed out of its previously planned summer window, with the publisher blaming certification issues on Xbox and PlayStation for the game's slip into what's now "likely" to be an October release.


XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division initially announced as Tom Clancy's XDefiant back in 2021 before dropping its prefix - has had a number of closed Insider tests and open sessions throughout its development and was expected to get its full launch for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC some time this summer.


However, writing in a post on Ubisoft's website, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin explained the game's continuing lack of a release date can largely be blamed on complication arising during Microsoft and Sony's certification processes for their respective consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last time you got up from playing Xbox in your Xbox-branded onesie to grab yourself some food made with your Xbox-branded cookbook from your Xbox-branded mini-fridge, did you by any chance say to yourself, "Gee, I really wish I'd been able to buy all this Xbox tat with an Xbox-branded credit card"? Well, guess what? Anything is possible in this darkest of timelines.


The official Xbox credit card will soon be a thing, albeit only in the US for the time being, having been conjured into existence through a partnership between Microsoft and Mastercard. It'll initially be available exclusively to Xbox Insiders (it's expected to expand to all US-based Xbox players starting next year) and offers one of those reward-based scheme things, which - and I'm not sure there's a nicer way of putting this - essentially incentivises people to increase their debt, so, you know, please use responsibly and all that.


Basically, everyday purchases made on the card will steadily accrue points that can be spent on games and add-ons via Xbox.com, but an initial purchase using the card will also reward cardholders with 5,000 points (equating to $50 USD), plus three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Only new members are eligible for that three-month deal, incidentally, but it can be gifted to other people if you're already a Game Pass subscriber yourself.

"The base case is that Gearbox remains a part of Embracer," Gearbox chief communications officer Dan Hewitt told staff in an email seen by Bloomberg. "However, there are many options under consideration, including Gearbox's transfer, taking Gearbox independent, and others. Ultimately, we'll move ahead with whichever path is best for both Gearbox and Embracer."


"Nothing has been decided yet," Hewitt added, "but there will be a lot of speculation in the coming weeks."

Sony announced a limited edition bundle for the upcoming Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which includes a custom PS5 cover. The cover features black tendrils on a red background to represent the battle between Venom and Spider-Man, complete with a white spidey logo in the corner.

Dbrand's version is aptly called Arachnoplates and is a close copy of Sony's design, albeit with more intricate webbing in the design and no spiders in sight.

The news comes via Window Central's Jez Corden, who's heard rumours that BioWare plans to "ditch open world and go back to [the franchise's] classic format".

Corden made the claim in the latest edition of his podcast, The Xbox Two Podcast, in a broader conversation about the pros of established studios sticking to the development blueprint that made their games so special versus the cons of taking risks and innovating, only for it to instantly crash and burn.

YouTuber Maka91Productions has released a full guide about their clever way to maximise your XP. Admittedly, you won't be able to get to it immediately – you'll need some skill points and the Outpost Engineering skill to set it up, as well as be pretty comfortable with the game's mechanics – but once you've a few hours under your belt, make sure you research power generation and resource extractors at a Research Laboratory.

How you configure your ship is just as important, too. As The Loadout notes, you should ensure your ship can carry 2000-3000 cargo space, and then make a beeline for these resources: Adaptive Frames (18), Aluminum (124), 2Beryllium (24), Copper (30), Fiber (2), Iron (99), and Tungsten (24) from Jemison Mercantile and the store on ship.

Until now, the game has only been playable on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X, but according to an update to the North American ratings board the ESRB, it looks like the action-RPG will shortly be making an appearance on Nintendo Switch, too.

As spotted by the eagle-eyed folks on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, nothing else about the rating listing has changed beyond the sneaky addition of "Nintendo Switch" to the platform list.
