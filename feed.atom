        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is streamlining Discord server voice chat support on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S by ditching the feature's convoluted mobile app requirement - a change currently going through Insider testing ahead of its public release.


Discord server voice chat support launched for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in September, making it possible for users to talk with their friends directly through Discord Voice chats, wherever they may be. Unfortunately, it's a pretty fiddly process in its current guise.


Users first need to link their Xbox and Discord accounts then download the Xbox mobile app to their phone - which must also be linked to a user's console. Discord is then launched on mobile or desktop, and once a user has joined the Voice call they want to transfer to Xbox, they need to select the 'transfer call' option. Next, hit the 'confirm' button back in the mobile app, at which point it's time to don a headset and start chatting via console.

In a separate round of interviews, Capcom staff have been discussing the project further - including the original's slightly contentious inclusion of button-mashing quick-time events (QTEs).


The good news here is the Resi 4 remake will tone these down - and in-game cut-scenes will no longer force you to quickly pick up the controller and spam a button to avoid death.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has given perhaps the best look yet at its highly anticipated Resident Evil 4 remake - and shared a little more on its various other Resident Evil projects - in its latest video showcase, with the remake getting both new gameplay footage and a new story trailer.


On the gameplay front, Capcom shared an action-packed couple of minutes of its RE4 remake, starting with a sequence from early in the game that sees protagonist Leon skulking through the woods before stumbling across a seemingly abandoned barn. It's a suitably atmospheric sequence, showing off the remake's various visual upgrades, and one that segues into a chaotic outdoor battle as Leon is swarmed by Ganado. Inevitably, things come to an end with our old friend chainsaw guy - but Leon somehow manages to keep his head on this time around.


Following its latest gameplay reveal, Capcom discussed the remake in a little more detail, explaining its goal is to "[pay] respect to original game's world while implementing new ideas and state of the art graphics to strengthen the core concepts of the title". This, it say, "will provide a fresh experience with a sense of familiarity if you played the original, that both newcomers and veterans to Resident Evil 4 will enjoy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends' 15th season, Eclipse, is right around the corner, and the usual promotional blitz is has begun ahead of its 1st November arrival - this time bringing a new cinematic trailer giving a first look at recently revealed new hero Catalyst's goopy abilities.


Catalyst - an "experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer", and the first trans Legend to join the Apex Legends' line-up - made her introductions earlier this week in a new animated episode of Stories from the Outlands. Here, we got a glimpse of her early years on the planet of Boreas - as she becomes unwittingly embroiled in an eco-terrorist plot to save Boreas' moon - but developer Respawn's latest trailer skips ahead to Catalyst's Apex Games debut.


There's a lot for eagle-eyed Apex Legends fans to unpack in the new cinematic trailer - including a fair glimpse at what is almost certainly Season 15's previously teased new moon map - but the focus is very much on Catalyst and her new abilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia - the striking new survival horror from acclaimed studio Santa Ragione - is free on the Epic Games Store next week, alongside Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.


Santa Ragione, if you're unfamiliar, previously released the celebrated likes of MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, but Saturnalia - which is heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - looks to be its most ambitious title yet, trapping players in an ancient village steeped in murky rituals and challenging them to uncover its many secrets.


Although a solo experience, players take control of four different characters as they investigate the village's labyrinthine, and decidedly psychedelic, streets. If one character get captured - horrible things lurk in the shadows - players can switch to another and attempt a rescue, but once all four are dead, the village physically reconfigures itself for another attempt. Thankfully, narrative and puzzle progress is retained across game-overs.

This is the next in the CMA's ongoing investigation into the acquisition, which entered Phase 2 at the start of September when the regulator decided the deal required more in-depth scrutiny.


Last week, as part of Phase 2, the CMA released its Issues Statement, detailing the focus of the inquiry's second stage and setting out the potential areas of concern - known as "theories of harm" - it's investigating. These relate to the acquisition's impact on multi-game subscription services, the future of cloud gaming, and the availability of Activision content on rival platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're chewing over last night's Silent Hill: Transmission broadcast, and Konami's big plans to relaunch its survival horror brand.

Silent Hill has lain dormant ever since Konami cancelled Silent Hills and unreleased Hideo Kojima's PT demo. The question is, will anything announced last night live up to that? There was plenty on offer - a remake, a new game, several spin-offs and a movie - from an array of developers. Still, it often felt like we were seeing little in the way of concrete details - release dates and actual gameplay footage.

Will Konami's sudden onslaught of Silent Hill bring about a fresh start for the series? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

Update 2.2 reworks Orbital in a similar manner to how September's patch reworked the (appropriately named) Renewal. Here, Battlefield developer DICE says it has "improved gameplay flow" and added more cover and assets, as well as various terrain improvements.


Another big addition to this update is that of persistent servers for Battlefield Portal, so your server will always remain available within the game's server browser - even when there are no active players.

Carter did not elaborate on what the Fallout London team was going to change this all to, instead saying fans would have to hold tight and be patient on this front. He was quite adamant, however, the team would not bring  back its ghoulish Royal Family members in the future.

"I personally would like to continue to work with Japanese studios to produce more anime in the future, partly because we have received very good feedback. However, just to be clear, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was planned as a standalone work, so there's no such thing as 'we are actually working on Season 2 in the background'," he said.

To get started with Scar, you'll just need to head over to the giant skull in the elephant graveyard - which has now opened up to reveal a fresh lair.

This free update will add the long-awaited campaign network co-op mode, as well as the official launch of the game's Forge beta (in case you missed it, some have already got their hands on it and have been creating some truly impressive reimaginings of games such as Ocarina of Time and PT within). 


In the campaign's upcoming co-op mode, you will be able to have a whirl around Halo Infinite's story with up to three other fellow Spartans. This will also be supported with the Mission Replay feature (finally), and 343 has revealed there will now be another 24 achievements to unlock in the game. As a reminder, this is not the local split-screen co-op, which the developer previously announced it had cancelled altogether.

When combined with --dry-run, there’s no chance of accidentally running a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Silent Hill: Transmission stream this evening, a new game known simply as Silent Hill f was announced. This marks the first new mainline game for the series in over a decade.


There are still very few details about this particular entry to the Silent Hill franchise. We do know its story is by Ryukishi07 (who created the When They Cry visual novel series), its characters and creatures are designed by Kera and its producer is Motoi Okamoto, whose name you may recognise from Nintendo.
Development duties are being handled by Neobards Entertainment, which has previously worked with Capcom as a support studio on several its Resident Evil games including Re:Verse.

In case you missed it, here's a roundup of everything announced during the Silent Hill showcase, dubbed 'Silent Hill Transmission', including all the trailers.


First up, we got a debut trailer for Bloober Team's much-rumoured Silent Hill 2 remake, which is set for PC via Steam and PlayStation 5. It's listed as a PlayStation console exclusive for 12 months, which suggests it will hit Xbox a year after launch.


Next came the reveal of Silent Hill Townfall, developed by Stories Untold and Observation maker No Code alongside Annapurna Interactive. This one remains something of a mystery. Expect more in the new year.

Alongside an array of Silent Hill game projects to look forward to, you should also be aware of a new Silent Hill film, set to follow the 2006 original that starred Sean Bean. 


Return to Silent Hill is the movie project we've heard whispers of previously from the original film's director Christophe Gans. Tonight, Konami assistant producer Rui Naito confirmed this big screen follow-up was very much a thing that was happening - and indeed that it has actually been the "catalyst" for the new wave of Silent Hill games coming to fruition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After what feels like an eternity of leaks, Konami has officially revived its long-dormant Silent Hill series with a flurry of activity, starting with remake of horror masterpiece Silent Hill 2, which is being developed by Bloober Team for PC and PS5 as a timed console exclusive.


Bloober Team - the studio behind the likes of The Medium, Layers of Fear, and Observer - has been rumoured to be involved in a Silent Hill revival as far back as June last year, when it announced a partnership with Konami to create a new game. Rumours that the project would be a Silent Hill 2 remake began to coalesce following a series of leaks earlier this year.


Now, though, Konami and Bloober Team have made things official, revealing the remake during a busy Silent-Hill-focused livestream in a two-and-a-half minute trailer. Here, we were shown some iconic Silent Hill 2 moments given a new-gen visual overhaul - extending to a slightly dubious makeover for protagonist James Sunderland, who now looks a little like Alan Wake's unpopular brother.

Not much has been revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie. "Why are you here?" he asks. "Here to be punished... That's good I like it. I think we've done something so awful that we are stuck here in this place being judged by these... people," he continues. 

The trailer ends with some frames of a man wearing glasses, before cutting to the logo of the game.

The detail comes from Xbox's full response to last week's filing by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, in which the regulator raised its current concerns regarding Microsoft's ongoing $68bn takeover attempt of Activision Blizzard.

Sony's existing marketing deal with Call of Duty sees the PlayStation branding used in conjunction with advertising, while players on Sony platforms get early access to in-game content.

The Crysis Remastered Trilogy, if this all seems a little like déjà vu, first released for PlayStation, Switch, and PC last October, but the PC version was limited to the Epic Games Store - despite the remaster of the original Crysis already having been launched on Steam.


Come November, though, Steam players will also have the opportunity to check out Crytek's remasters of Crysis 2 and 3, with all three games bundled into one package featuring various tweaks and enhancements for their respective single-player campaigns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I popped over to The Trafford Centre to check out Pokémon: Art Through the Ages.


The event, which was announced last month, is styled as a treasure hunt and requires you to look around The Trafford Centre for pictures and paintings of Pokémon. It features all 151 species from the Kanto Pokédex, with some small activities dotted around to get you exploring.


For anyone who's not aware of The Trafford Centre (TTC), it's a big shopping and leisure complex in Manchester. As well as shops, there's also an Odeon, a Namco Funscape, and even a Sea Life aquarium and Legoland Discovery Centre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly building an Xbox mobile gaming store in direct competition with Apple and Google.


The news, as reported by The Verge, has emerged due to filings from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in Microsoft's ongoing $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard.




Both the popularity of Activision's mobile games and the inclusion of King are major factors in Microsoft's buyout as it looks to expand the Xbox brand further into mobile gaming.

The furore around the game's voice actresses has been raised once more after new claims surfaced disputing that original Bayonetta voice actress Hellena Taylor was offered just $4k to work on the third game.




The debate has fired up both passion and negativity on all sides: towards Taylor, Platinum Games, and Hale, who was somewhat unwittingly dragged into the fiasco.

Activision Blizzard had previously argued against this process going ahead, and claimed it should be a decision made by a larger group of employees at the Albany studio rather than its testing team. Ultimately, the NLRB disagreed.

In addition to these specs, Infinity Ward has also announced those who pre-ordered the game digitally will be able to get their preloads on the go from today (19th October). This will in turn offer up those eight days of early campaign access announced in August, which will go live tomorrow.


Meanwhile, preloading for the full release (which, unlike the early access mentioned above, will include the multiplayer and Special Ops elements) can begin from the 26th October ahead of the game's official launch on the 27th/28th, depending on where you are playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Netflix's gaming strategy grows ever bolder following its first tentative steps into the market, the streaming service has now revealed it's "seriously exploring" its own cloud gaming offering.


That's according to Netflix's vice president of gaming Mike Verdu, who, speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt (thanks TechCrunch), explained the company saw the technology as "a value add" for subscribers. "We're not asking you to subscribe as a console replacement. It's a completely different business model. The hope is over time that it just becomes this very natural way to play games where wherever you are."


Addressing the elephant in the room - the dramatic failure of Google's game streaming service Stadia, which will cease operations in January, a little over three years after its initial launch - Verdu noted that while Stadia was a "technical success" and was "fun to play games on", "it had some issues with the business model."

Taylor - who has been replaced by voice actor Jennifer Hale for Bayonetta 3 - made the claim in a series of emotional videos shared on Twitter this weekend, citing Platinum's "insulting [pay] offer" as the reason for her absence in the third game.


"I didn't want the world, I didn't ask for too much," she said in one video. "I was just asking for a decent, dignified living wage. What they did was legal, but it was immoral." Taylor also called for a boycott of Bayonetta 3, suggesting fans instead donated their money to charity.

It's said to be built on a foundation of "charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories" that will stay true to previous Sims games while also "pushing to evolve how those Sims think and behave, [pushing] tools even further when creating and customising, and [exploring] innovative ways to not only tell stories but to collaborate on those stories or creations with your closest friends across your favourite devices."

What that actually means in practice isn't immediately clear from the trailer's rapid cuts and overbearing stylings, but EA sheds more light on the matter in an accompanying press release.


"In Need for Speed Unbound," it explains, "players have to take risks to get to the top. Choose how and when to put it all on the line, pulling huge drifts on the street, outdriving the cops, or placing side bets with their own earnings against rival racers."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go has launched a new kind of raid activity - Elite Raids - designed to test players' mettle in return for ultra-rare creatures.


Beyond being a test for players with a buffed-up Pokémon team, Elite Raids also seem like Pokémon Go developer Niantic's latest nudge to get users back outside in big numbers, generating the kind of crowds you might see playing pre-pandemic.


The first evidence of Elite Raids began popping up in-game on Friday, with an extended 24-hour countdown clock on some Pokémon gyms and a flashy new raid egg on the game's map. A message stated these raids would require players to take part in-person at the raid site itself, rather than using a Remote Raid Pass to join from the sofa.

But in a change to tradition, we didn't get a title for the update or its full list of additions - in response to the fact Mojang has  struggled in the past to deliver everything it has previously promised. 


For now, Minecraft's 2023 update is being referred to as "Minecraft 1.20", and is confirmed to feature camels, hanging signs, chiseled bookshelves and bamboo crafting - including the ability to build a bamboo raft. Camels look a particularly interesting addition - as they can jump fair distances and fit two players riding on top.

This news was confirmed by Gotham Knights' executive producer Fleur Marty via Discord. Here, Marty explained this was "due to the types of features" included in the game, adding the additional option of a performance mode would not have been "as straightforward as lowering the resolution and getting a higher FPS".


Marty highlighted the game's "highly detailed" open-world setting and its untethered co-op gameplay as two of the reasons the upcoming game does not "have a performance/quality toggle option". She concluded by confirming Gotham Knights will run at 30FPS on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 (the developer previously confirmed it had canned the planned PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game).

This latest journey to the realms of spookidom is the third Halloween event for Dreams, following previous outings that saw Media Molecule collaborating with its community to create explorable haunted houses and then, last year, a creepy old fairground.


Things are getting a little more fantastical this time around, however, with a quest to the far-flung Land of Lost Dreams, where players can embark on a quest full of odd characters and puzzles as they attempt to uncover a "rich and unnerving history".

Switch Sports' version 1.2.1 update launched earlier this week, aiming to further strengthen measures against what Nintendo called "disruptive behaviours" online, as well as pledging to suspend any online players violating its Community Guidelines. Punishable actions included "fraudulent behaviour such as save data manipulation."


Unfortunately, patch 1.2.1 also introduced a significant bug causing crashes - whether playing online or offline - during the pre-match loading screen.

Finding The Flowzone, as the new expansion is known, takes OlliOlli World's acclaimed skating action high above Radlandia, with players roaming the clouds in a fantastical floating boat alongside the infamous Radmospheric Three - "grizzled sea-dog Captain Squid, the prim and proper Professor Planks, and the mystically inclined Christopher Licht". 


Ultimately, the goal is to reach the fabled city of Radlantis, meet the legendary Gail Force, and compete before the Skate Godz to earn the Radlantis Rivals Cup. First, though, players must complete courses set among the clouds, with some familiar Radlandia sights providing the backdrop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it's not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we're pressing the 'unlaunch' button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th," says Nvidia, in a remarkable new blog post that effectively calls a halt to the upcoming launch of its most contentious of RTX 4000 releases, hinting that it'll be renamed when it does eventually re-emerge. RTX 4070 Ti anyone?
Unveiled by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on September 20th, the RTX 4000 line of graphics hardware is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, fabricated on TSMC's 4nm process. The flagship GPU - the GeForce RTX 4090 - released a couple of days ago and was lauded for its massive generational leap over the existing RTX 3000 flagships, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. However, it's fair to say that the same level of acclaim and anticipation was not bestowed upon the RTX 4080, announced in two very different flavours.
The table below reveals that the spec differential wasn't just about the amount of onboard VRAM: each RTX 4080 model was based on an entirely different core processor, with wild variations in the amount of CUDA codes (compute power) and memory bandwidth. In effect, two very different graphics cards were being sold under the same name at very different price-points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Motive has been uncommonly talkative throughout the development of its Dead Space remake, with the studio hosting various livestreams to show off the likes of its improved art, audio, and gameplay changes - but now, with the game's 27th January launch inching ever nearer, we've had our clearest look yet at how all those elements will come together, courtesy of a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough.


Hot on the heels of last week's 2-minute gameplay trailer, EA celebrated Dead Space's 14th anniversary today with an extended sequence from the remake's third chapter, in which protagonist Isaac must explore the infested USG Ishimura in order to reach the ship's engineering deck take and repair its engines.


The sequence began in Ishimura's hanger - an area that's now much bigger than it was in the original (a side-by-side comparison made the differences abundantly clear) - with players now able to zero-g their way around the area. Some of remake's environmental changes have been made to enhance the atmosphere, while other were required to accommodate the fact the Ishimura is now one seamless, interconnected ship, with players no longer needed to rely on the tram to get around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go's annual Halloween event is often one of its best activities and, as expected, this year features a number of new bits and pieces in-game. The event's first half, running from October 20th to 27th, features the arrival of Mega Banette in Mega Raids for the first time, plus the Shiny versions of Noibat and Galarian Yamask. But it also offers some more surprising additions. 


 These include the decision by developer Niantic to sell not one but two cheap event tickets featuring time-limited quests and rewards, with both a $1 and $5 option available. From the sounds of things, these will each offer different rewards, with the former offering encounters with Yamask, while the pricier option gets you an admittedly very cool animated Halloween lantern avatar item/pose.


Niantic is obviously trying something new here with a pair of different ticket options for the same overall event, as well as the fact these rewards will be time-limited - even if you paid. Typically, event questlines from Special Research remain in-game permanently, allowing you to complete them at your leisure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After eight years, the Destiny franchise is moving on from its various destination materials - the Spinmetal, Helium Filaments and Relic Iron you could zoom around on your Sparrow vehicle and harvest while patrolling the series' many planets and moons.


Some of my earliest memories from Destiny 1 are of looping the Cosmodrome for Spinmetal Leaves, hopping off my Sparrow to gather them, then heading off to the next node. Levelling your gear - which in turn levels your character - required plugging bits of these resources in, and I don't want to think about the number of hours I spent grinding these out.


Now, or rather as of Destiny 2's upcoming Season 19, the materials themselves will no longer be available to acquire - although you can still go zooming around on your Sparrow if you want to.

A couple of days ago, a teaser was released where Iono, a new gym leader character described as an influencer and livestreamer within the Pokémon universe, asked viewers to guess what her partner Pokémon was.

We were given the following clues: appearance-wise it's squishy, sluggish with an easygoing vibe, and has "two big ol' bumps on its noggin that people always mistake for eyes". And it's "so cute", according to Iono.

"While some heroes are performing better than others, and there are differences across player skill levels, we have been happy to see that no hero's overall power level is far out of line with our goals," Blizzard said.

This will not apply on console, however, or to anyone on PC who verified their account to play the existing Warzone previously.

ORIGINAL STORY 11.45am UK:
Silent Hill is an unsettling series across the board, there's no denying that - and the silhouette of its fan-favourite Pyramid Head is enough to induce nightmares. 


Now we know more about how this monstrous humanoid came to be, at least in terms of his conception - and it turns out he was inspired by background characters from the 1995 film Braveheart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're back discussing Microsoft's big Activision Blizzard deal and the latest developments in the ongoing saga of the $68bn buyout being finalised.

Yesterday, Microsoft leapt upon the latest concerned update from the UK's deal regulator and repeatedly tried to minimise its own importance in the video games market. Microsoft stated it was far from the leader in terms of console share and PC games sold, and lacked any real presence on mobile devices. In a particularly eye-opening claim, Microsoft even said PlayStation's userbase would be "significantly larger" than Xbox even if every COD player ditched Sony. At the same time, Microsoft also criticised the regulator for appearing to take Sony's own complaints about the deal at face value. 

Is this fighting talk from Microsoft, or squeaky bum time in Redmond over real concerns the UK will block the deal outright? Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan share their thoughts on whether the deal will go through, what changes  Microsoft could make to get it over the finish line, and whether it should go ahead.

Resurgence, which was announced at last year's Game Awards, takes place after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, telling its story from the alternating perspectives of two different characters - First Officer Jara Rydek and Engineering Crewperson Carter Diaz - with gameplay said to consist of playable cinematic sequences.


Everything shown so far points to an experience very much in the same vein as the interactive narrative adventures pioneered by Telltale Games - which isn't particularly surprising given that Dramatic Labs was founded by controversial former Telltale Games boss Kevin Bruner, and includes around 20 former Telltale employees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you can somehow still look at your gaming backlog without being consumed by existential dread, here's another two additions for your infinitely expanding pile: Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition and Evoland Legendary Edition, both free next week on the Epic Games Store.


Fallout 3 likely needs no introduction, given its lofty place in the gaming pantheon. Released back in 2008, it was Bethesda's first foray into the Fallout universe (1 and 2 were the work of Black Isle Studios), expanding on the open-world RPG freedom of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion to deliver a sprawling, dizzyingly rich post-apocalyptic jaunt through The Capital Wasteland.


An "embarrassment of riches" is what Eurogamer called Fallout 3 in 2008, describing it as a "thrilling, all-consuming experience that will absorb you for weeks... as you fall in love with the relentless excitement, incredible atmosphere, sense of place and sheer choice." The Game of the Year Edition being given away on Epic includes the base game and all its DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Insomniac Games' formerly PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be coming to PC on 18th November - and ahead of its release, Sony has detailed the PC port's system-specific features and requirements.


In case it somehow wasn't immediately obvious, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the Miles-Morales-starring follow-up to Insomniac's original Marvel's Spider-Man, taking the first game's acclaimed web-swinging open-world action and infusing it with a new hero and a bit of snowy, seasonal jollity thanks to its year-end setting.


"Insomniac's second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original," said Eurogamer's Martin Robinson in his Recommended review, "but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It's a game that's full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The growing popularity of digital purchases has had the unintended effect of breaking down regional pricing barriers designed to keep games affordable all over the world. 


This is due to "region-hopping" - a tactic used by those seeking to take advantage of lower prices in other countries, as publishers adjust the price of games in each region based on median incomes. 


The trouble with this is it means customers from richer economies can also loophole themselves into grabbing a game for significantly cheaper than their own local pricing.

As part of the deal, Nintendo must also display a notice informing employees (in block capital letters) they "WILL NOT" be fired or stopped from discussing unionisation.

The duo can regularily be seen getting into all sorts of exploits that often result in them losing girls, getting wedgies and a myriad of other such fiascos. Remember that time Bart sold his soul to Milhouse? That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. 
However, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as "The Springfield Files."

This episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer's conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out. But that is not what we are here to talk about. Rather, I want to remind you all of the arcade game Milhouse plays in this episode - Kevin Costner's Waterworld.

Signs were good that FIFA 23 had performed well at launch this year. Launched on 30th September, the game's first week of UK boxed game sales slightly beat those of FIFA 22 - despite the overall trend of declining physical game sales in favour of digital.

Howard began the chat by detailing a few of Starfield's inspirations - 1984 space sim SunDog: Frozen Legacy and pen-and-paper RPG Traveller, if you're wondering - before moving on to tackle the "hard sci-fi" question. This, he said, was a little tricky to answer insofar as different people will likely have different definitions of "hard sci-fi", but for Bethesda, "It is more hard to us, where you can draw that line from, okay, here's how man explored space, and [then] look at our ships and say, alright that has some visual identity back to that".


However, he also called the question a bit of a trap, "because it's a video game. Like, a hard science-fiction video game would be, you die in space cold."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has finally revamped its decidedly decrepit Steam mobile app for iOS and Android, introducing a fresh look, a new interface, and a range of new features.


The original version of Valve's Steam mobile app launched over a decade ago, and it's felt exceedingly outdated for a very long time. As of today, though, iOS and Android users can download a completely refreshed version via their device's respective app stores.


It's most immediately obvious change is a considerably more streamlined interface - which gives quick access to the store, personalised news, Steam Guard, and notifications, as well as unburying the likes of wish lists and other key features - but there's plenty more besides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Torchlight: Infinite - a new free-to-play reimagining of the dungeon-crawling action-RPG series - has just launched its open beta on Android, iOS, and PC.


Torchlight, if you're unfamiliar, was originally the work of now-defunct developer Runic Games, which made two games in the series before its closure in 2017 - the sequel delivering a critically acclaimed chunk of captivating dungeon-crawling and class-based hack-and-slash action. 


Having disbanded Runic, publisher Perfect World then revived the series just nine months later, handing the reins to developer Echtra Games for 2020's Torchlight 3. Interestingly, this third outing was initially planned to be a free-to-play title before Perfect World eventually capitulated after a bit of an outcry - but now, following Torchlight 3's less-than-stellar reception, those free-to-play plans are back for Torchlight: Infinite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FIFA has launched its first video game venture since its split with EA - a vaguely football-themed Roblox "immersive experience" intended to tie-in with this year's Qatar world cup.


Following the termination of FIFA's partnership with EA earlier this year - which will result in the latter's long-running football series being rebranded as EA Sports FC from 2023 - FIFA president Gianni Infantino insisted, "I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans."


To that end, it said it had already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024, but would first be launching a number of "non-simulation games" toward the end of this year.

Overwatch 2 players can look forward to "several Double Match XP weekends" - dates for which will be announced soon. Anyone who logs in this season from 25th October onwards will also get a Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary skin and a Health Pack Weapon Charm, which is nice I guess.

<blockquote><p>We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Early backdoor attacks against machine learning set off an arms race in attack and defence development. Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Authors: Rodrigo Campos (Microsoft), Giuseppe Scrivano (Red Hat)
Kubernetes v1.25 introduces the support for user namespaces.
This is a major improvement for running secure workloads in
Kubernetes. Each pod will have access only to a limited subset of the
available UIDs and GIDs on the system, thus adding a new security
layer to protect from other pods running on the same system.
How does it work?
A process running on Linux can use up to 4294967296 different UIDs and
GIDs.
User namespaces is a Linux feature that allows mapping a set of users
in the container to different users in the host, thus restricting what
IDs a process can effectively use.
Furthermore, the capabilities granted in a new user namespace do not
apply in the host initial namespaces.
Why is it important?

Immutable fields can be found in a few places in the built-in Kubernetes types.
For example, you can't change the .metadata.name of an object. Specific objects
have fields where changes to existing objects are constrained; for example, the
.spec.selector of a Deployment.
Aside from simple immutability, there are other common design patterns such as
lists which are append-only, or a map with mutable values and immutable keys.
Until recently the best way to restrict field mutability for CustomResourceDefinitions
has been to create a validating
admission webhook:
this means a lot of complexity for the common case of making a field immutable.
Beta since Kubernetes 1.25, CEL Validation Rules allow CRD authors to express
validation constraints on their fields…]]></summary>

The Kubernetes in-tree storage plugin to Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration infrastructure has already been beta since v1.17. CSI migration was introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.14.
Since then, SIG Storage and other Kubernetes special interest groups are working to ensure feature stability and compatibility in preparation for CSI Migration feature to go GA.
SIG Storage is excited to announce that the core CSI Migration feature is generally available in Kubernetes v1.25 release!
SIG Storage wrote a blog post in v1.23 for CSI Migration status update which discussed the CSI migration status for each storage driver. It has been a while and this article is intended to give a latest status update on each storage driver for their CSI Migration status in Ku…]]></summary>
