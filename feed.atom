The user/group ID related security settings in Pod's securityContext trigger a problem when users want to
deploy containers that use accelerator devices (via Kubernetes Device Plugins) on Linux. In this blog
post I talk about the problem and describe the work done so far to address it. It's not meant to be a long story about getting the k/k issue fixed.
Instead, this post aims to raise awareness of the issue and to highlight important device use-cases too. This is needed as Kubernetes works on new related features such as support for user namespaces.

<blockquote><p>The SQUID cryptocurrency peaked at a price of $2,861 before plummeting to $0 around 5:40 a.m. ET., according to the website <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/squid-game/">CoinMarketCap</a>. This kind of theft, commonly called a &#8220;rug pull&#8221; by crypto investors, happens when the creators of the crypto quickly <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa">cash out</a> their coins for real money, draining the liquidity pool from the exchange.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why anyone would trust an investment &#8212; any investment &#8212; that you could buy but not sell.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal Crossing: New Horizons has finally been given a long-awaited - and desperately needed - shot in the arm, courtesy of Nintendo's 2.0 update which, somewhat unexpectedly, arrived earlier today. We already knew it was going to be a big one, of course, but we now have a much clearer idea of just how big it actually is, with data miners having successfully unearthed and catalogued a whopping 9,000+ new items as part of the update.
Granted, a fair few of those items - as datamined by NWPlayer123, Trundler, and VillagerDB, and shared by AnimalCrossingWorld - are colour variations, but even taking those into account, it's still a mammoth set of additions, covering clothing items, furniture, a multitude of different light fixtures, cooking apparatus, and more.

Spider-Man was originally due to arrive "early" 2021, but players began to wonder if something was seriously amiss when the character, having failed to materialise in that initial launch window, was conspicuously absent from a development roadmap stretching all the way into "summer and beyond". Crystal Dynamics eventually moved to reassure fans that Spidey was still coming but his exact arrival date remained unclear - until now.

<blockquote><p>Nobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers. We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers&#8217; IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization&#8217;s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers. We began observing this latest campaign in May 2021 and have been notifying impacted partners and customers while also developing new technical assistance and guidance for the reseller community. Since May, we have notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers that have been targeted by Nobelium. We continue to investigate, but to date we believe as many as 14 of these resellers and service providers have been compromised. Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel unveiled its 12th-gen processors today, shedding light on what promises to be the company's biggest step forward in on the desktop for years. These are finally 10nm parts - after seven brutal years and multiple 14nm iterations - and they also adopt a radically different hybrid design, with a combination of low-power 'Efficient' cores and high-power multi-threaded 'Performance' cores.
The top chip, the Core i9 12900K, includes eight of each type, for 16 cores and 24 threads in total, and promises to offer boosts of up to 30 percent depending on workload. For gaming, Intel is projecting gains of up to 20 percent, again depending on the game - and with the potential for more to come as games are optimised for the unique arrangement. These chips should also multi-task better, with the more efficient E cores taking on background tasks like streaming or virus scans while the P cores handle gaming or content creation. The new CPUs will arrive on November 4th, so we don't have long to wait!

        <updated>2021-10-21T14:48:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia has announced a raft of upgrades for its GeForce Now cloud streaming service with a new premium tier offering RTX 3080 class graphics performance, allowing for 1440p120 gameplay across a range of platforms and 4K60 HDR, limited for now to Shield Android TV devices. New latency reductions techniques are also promised, with Nvidia making bold claims about input lag up against competing cloud technologies - and even local devices.
All of this is made possible via brand new class of server blade Nvidia is bringing online, dubbed the 'SuperPod'. While you're not getting to an actual RTX 3080 as such, you are getting equivalent enterprise-class hardware based on the same GA-102 silicon, backed up by an eight-core, 16 thread AMD Threadripper processor working in combination with ultra-fast PCIe Gen 4.0 solid-state storage and an impressive 28GB of 3200MHz DDR4 memory. This gives the SuperPod top-class graphics performance (only an RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 3090 are faster in the Nvidia stack), though CPU performance would fall a little short of the latest Ryzen 5000 and Intel CPUs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Volition's first reveal of its upcoming Saints Row reboot did not, it's fair to say, seem to bare much in common with the series of old. A few gameplay snippets that followed helped bridge the divide, but a newly revealed look at some early missions has given the clearest indication yet of how Volition is looking to revitalise its ageing sandbox series.
As shared by GameInformer, the new nine-minute pre-alpha gameplay video offers a look at two early story missions: Making Rent and Idol Threat. The first of these takes place before the Saints are even officially formed, with The Boss and the game's core supporting - Kevin, Neenah, and Eli, all previously members of rival gangs - orchestrating a robbery on a loan office to raise some cash.

It turns out that the VP had approved over 10 different push-based messages for logins that he was not involved in. When the VP was asked why he approved logins for logins he was not actually doing, his response was, &#8220;They (IT) told me that I needed to click on Approve when the message appeared!&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Switch players began flagging Dying Light: Platinum Edition's unexpected absence from eShop in multiple territories, despite its 19th October release date, over on Reddit. The mystery was eventually solved by an official Techland spokesperson, who explained the issue stems from the fact Nintendo's European eShop is registered in Germany - a country where Dying Light is currently unrated and thus prohibited from sale.

And now, a new beta update for Half-Life 2 has been discovered, seemingly released to ensure the seminal FPS meets the requirements needed to earn Steam Deck's top-tier Verified compatibility badge.
Half-Life 2's new beta branch update, as spotted and detailed by Valve watcher Tyler McVicker on YouTube, reportedly covers a surprising amount of ground, not only making adjustments to the way the UI and resolution are handled in-game - primarily to ensure Half-Life 2 fits Steam Deck's aspect ratio and remains legible at the machine's relatively diminutive size - but addressing some long-standing bugs as well.

The post will show you how to create a specialized service kube-proxy

the default Kubernetes Service implementation, the "kube-proxy". An
important feature of kpng is that it can be used as a library to
create proxiers outside K8s. While this is useful for CNI-plugins that
replaces the kube-proxy it also opens the possibility for anyone to
create a proxier for a special purpose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the Analogue Pocket set for release later this year, some new details about the device and future Analogue products has surfaced with the reveal of Analogue OS. Moving away from the basic but functional menu design of prior products, Analogue OS seems to be focusing on bringing quality of life features that could greatly enhance the overall experience.
The library feature is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects. This database of information, accessible directly from the device, was seemingly curated with the goal of identifying any and all variants of a game. For games which have had dozens of revisions, including different regions, the library can provide all relevant information. This could even help identify pirate carts as simply inserting the game into the unit will provide information about that specific cartridge. Knowing how common pirated Game Boy cartridges have become, this could become a quick way to identify legit carts for collectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took mere moments for Xbox Series X to enter the pantheon of memes following its December 2019 reveal, when its less-than-delicate heft was widely and enthusiastically compared to a refrigerator. Two years on, the meme still lingers and Microsoft has announced you'll be able to pre-order your very own official Xbox Series X mini fridge starting next Tuesday.
Microsoft initially embraced the Xbox fridge meme (with considerably gusto) last October, when it sent real Xbox Series X fridges - 6-foot, 400 pound, 1:1 scale replicas of the console - out to influencers and rapper Snoop Dogg. The gag was resurrected once again this March when Microsoft produced some mini fridge variants of the full-sized design to use as prizes in a promotion for Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's new energy drink.
