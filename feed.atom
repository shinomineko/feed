On April 23, 2021, the Release Team merged a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) changing the Kubernetes release cycle from four releases a year (once a quarter) to three releases a year.
This blog post provides a high level overview about what this means for the Kubernetes community's contributors and maintainers.
What's changing and when
Starting with the Kubernetes 1.22 release, a lightweight policy will drive the creation of each release schedule. This policy states:
The first Kubernetes release of a calendar year should start at the second or third
week of January to provide people more room after coming back from the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has unveiled its previously teased "new Tom Clancy game", revealing it to be XDefiant, a 6v6 free-to-play first-person shooter that, just as leaks suggested, mashes up factions from Ghost Recon, The Division, and Splinter Cell.
In its announcement video, Ubisoft calls XDefiant a "high-octane" arena shooter - playable solo or with friends - that features an "irreverent and rebellious" take on the normally serious Clancy vibe, alongside "realistic gunplay" and personalised classes in the form of factions. 
Each faction is said to offer its own "gameplay and team dynamics", as well as unique passive traits, ultras, and abilities that will "change the moment-to-moment gameplay". Players will be able to mix and match any faction, load out, and weapon - Ubisoft promises an "arsenal of authentic weapons and attachments" - and these can all be switched at will during a respawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised, EA has shared "a little something" related to its its highly anticipated Skate revival after announcing there'd be no news on the latest instalment of its long-dormant skateboarding series during this Thursday's EA Play Live. Skate fans probably shouldn't get too excited though; beyond confirmation that the game is still in the works, there's little to see here.
Announced last June, EA's Skate revival - the fourth game in the series and the first instalment since 2010's Skate 3 - is being worked on by recently formed studio Full Circle, which counts original Skate creators Deran Chung and Cuz Parry among its number.
Given that Full Circle only formally came into existence at the start of this year, work on the new Skate game is unsurprisingly still in its early stages, and Chung said as much in EA's new teaser video. "The truth is it's still early," he explained. "We're still working on it".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn has released a new Stories from the Outlands video, and this one is all about new character Seer: a cursed legend with microdrones and a very cool hat. 
Metamorphosis tells the story of Seer's childhood, explaining that "a bad omen cast a shadow" over his birth, and that his glance "can turn a mountain to dust, a king to a beggar and an ocean to a desert". It's a stunning video, and if you're wondering why the art style looks familiar, that's because the trailer was made in collaboration with animator Robert Valley, who's known for series Love, Death and Robots.    
The Apex Legends website gives a little more detail on the upcoming season, Emergence, and some further snippets of info about Seer. Apparently Seer wields microdrones and has an "artist's eye", which allows him to "spot opportunities that other Legends might miss, and seize them in the most beautiful way he can". A new LMG called the Rampage is also being introduced next season, and it apparently has a "surprising" amount of firepower. The new season will also introduce that much-anticipated Ranked mode for Arenas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go pulled off its big annual Go Fest event at the weekend with enjoyable gameplay and some excellent storytelling flourishes. In-game and in the real world, developer Niantic dropped an array of teases for the game's future, and seemed to nimbly avoid the technical snafus seen in the past when millions of people have logged on to play simultaneously.
Go Fest 2021 was ostensibly about Meloetta, the Mythical Pokémon said to inspire music. The event's first day was spent putting together a band of Pokémon creatures via a Choose Your Own Adventure-style experience which summoned Meloetta to catch at the end.
Day two of the event, on Sunday, was supposedly just about raiding - though Niantic had some other surprises in store. As the first day wrapped up at 6pm local time, a new Mythical creature suddenly appeared on Pokémon Go's loading screen. Then, from 2am, the game's skybox suddenly changed to a galactic background, dotted by mysterious animated portals.

New World is the imminent MMO from Amazon that's based around an Age of Discovery kind of idea. You set sail for a magical island with a powerful magical secret, and try to make a home there. Its key features are territory ownership and housing, and player versus player warfare, in addition to a large fantastical world to battle with and explore.
Verfaillie was referring to the paid quality of life and experience boosters players found evidence of during New World's concluded alpha test. These suggested you might be able to pay for things like rested experience, which can help you level up faster, as well as fast travel.

It's not all doom and gloom, however: the statement said the team is "stoked to share a little something with you all tomorrow", so it seems we'll be getting some form of Skate news this week after all. Perhaps we'll finally get a name, or even a teeny tiny teaser.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has taken the unusual step of responding to a recent Bloomberg report on the upcoming Switch OLED.
Bloomberg, which led reporting earlier this year on the upcoming Switch remodel, reported last week that the OLED model was being priced higher to give Nintendo a better profit margin compared to the original Switch. Without naming Bloomberg, Nintendo issued a rare tweet to state "the claim is incorrect".
Nintendo went on to clarify that, beyond Switch OLED, it had "no plans for launching any other model at this time", pouring cold water on the suggestion a further new model might be in the works.

The developer/publisher refrained from detailing anything else other than confirming that the reveal would take place at 7pm UK time (11am PT) tomorrow, 17th July, and shared a curious three-second-long teaser that features a lot of stickers and neon. Here, take a look for yourself:
The tweet links to a YouTube video entitled "New Tom Clancy's Game Worldwide Reveal" and promises "things are going to get wild".

"Just to make sure as many people here know as possible, Take-Two have been going heavy with the DMCAs this week, first starting with GTAV map mods like GTA3 Portland, Vice City Overhaul, etc," writes Ash_735 on the official GTA Forums (thanks, PC Gamer).
As Ash puts it, an agreement to help the publisher and the modding community peacefully coexist was struck a little while back when Take-Two "tried to make modding GTA games illegal".

The news came via Twitter user Idle Sloth, who showed that if you select "Manage with Game Pass" on the the game's Xbox Store page, it'll give you the full install size: 97.2GB.
As our pals at Pure Xbox report, that's just the standard edition, too, so depending upon what flavour current-gen Xbox you're running - the X or S - and what edition you'd like to play, it may take up even more than that.

The part-business, part-memoir book - called Disrupting the Game: From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo - also shares business and "leadership lessons" from the executive, including "how to create vibrant and believable visions for your team and company [and] how to maintain relentless curiosity and know when to ask questions to shatter the status quo".
"Although he's best known as Nintendo's iconic President of the Americas-immortalised for opening Nintendo's 2004 E3 presentation with, 'My name is Reggie, I'm about kicking ass, I'm about taking names, and we're about making games'-Reggie Fils-Aimé's story is the ultimate gameplan for anyone looking to beat the odds and achieve success," the book's Amazon blurb says (thanks, VGC).

Inspired by characters from God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Shadow of the Colossus, and Bloodborne, the outfits had originally only been available for a limited time over the Christmas holidays. Now, however, they can be unlocked by completing any Legends Story or Survival mission with each class.
That's not all, though. The team also took the time to share some stats about the Ghost of Tsushima, including the revelation that since it launched a year ago, collectively there have been 679.2 million standoffs, 333.1 million duels, 68.5 Haikus written, and together we've taken 61 million in-game photos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some more speedrunning to watch following this year's Summer Games Done Quick? There's plenty more where that came from, as all-women speedrunning event Flame Fatales is taking place next month. 
The online event is taking place between 15th-21st August, and will be broadcast on the Games Done Quick Twitch channel. There's a real variety of games listed in the lineup, with everything from Warframe to a 15-card run of Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories. There are speedrunning favourites like Celeste and Super Metroid, along with some stranger entries like Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue. Oh, and I'm also glad to see there's also a Fire Emblem: Three Houses run in there. 
The event is being held in support of Malala Fund - a non-profit organisation founded by Malala and Ziauddin Yousafzai in 2013, which works to "champion every girl's right to 12 years of free, safe, quality education". Flame Fatales raised $80k (£63.8k) for Malala Fund last year, and since 2010, Games Done Quick events have raised over $34m (£24.6m) for charity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a year of research, Pokémon Go fans have uncovered a hidden mechanic involved in catching creatures from raid battles.
The research, published today by fan resource The Silph Road, appears to show a secret modifier that boosts the likelihood of catching a raid boss over the course of an encounter.
Simply put, the longer it takes you to catch a boss, the more likely it becomes that your next Premier Ball throw will actually do so. Or, as The Silph Road reports: "You are more likely to catch the raid boss on the 10th throw of the encounter than on your first."

The developer plans to update the High Alert perk to let players hear Dead Silent footsteps. Currently, all High Alert does is make your vision pulse whenever enemies outside of your view see you. By then, of course, it's often too late.
This change to High Alert is important for anyone who plays Warzone - a game in which your ability to hear your enemy coming can make the difference between winning and losing a gunfight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Summer Games Done Quick is all wrapped up, but if you're looking for another exciting speedrun to watch, this world record-breaking blindfolded Super Mario Bros. run seems like a good place to start. 
Speedrunner Crescendo posted a video of the world record run last night, with the timer showing that he managed to beat the game in 11 minutes and 55 seconds. It appears the previous record was held by speedrunner dodai, who achieved a time of 14 minutes and 46 seconds back in 2016. 
This all sounds impressive on paper, but the run itself makes for remarkable viewing: at one point Crescendo has to accurately count down the seconds needed to run a sufficient distance before making a series of perfect jumps. He uses fireballs as an echolocation device, and is able to figure out his surroundings from the noise they make when hitting a wall. He also seems to break bricks to figure out his position.

Raven has talked about making it so it takes longer to kill an enemy in Warzone for some time now.
This morning, a sweeping weapon balance pass, which Raven called "the biggest balance update in the history of Warzone", has seen some weapons heavily nerfed. Guns such as the SCAR, Oden, both AK-47s and the FAL all took a hit, with a particular focus on reducing torso multipliers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Re:Verse, the multiplayer component for this year's Resident Evil Village, will now launch in 2022. 
Re:Verse had been given a vague July launch window, after previously being delayed from launching alongside Village back in May.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft maker Mojang has released a new Caves and Cliffs test live for PC, and fans are seriously impressed by the changes it makes.
The 1.18 experimental snapshot allows for some truly spectacular world generation, including realistic-looking mountain peaks and Mines of Moria-like cave structures. 
The only thing which disappointed me was these "cheese", "spaghetti" and "noodle" caves were not actually places you could mine out Italian foodstuffs. (Those names simply reflect the holey or elongated shapes created by the snapshot's cave generation algorithm.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTube is getting several new live-streaming features today, and they may seem rather familiar, as all three of them have been popular features on Twitch for some time. 
As spotted by The Verge, YouTube streamers will now be able to create polls inside their chats, and limit the chats to subscribers-only. Viewers will now also be able to create clips of streams. 
Although the features are hardly the most original, they should give YouTube streamers a little more control over their communities. The subscribers-only chat option is a useful way to moderate discussion and discourage any unwelcome drive-by comments from new viewers. Polls provide another way for viewers to stay engaged with the action - and are a handy tool for streamers looking to find out what their community wants to watch next.

The streaming giant has now hired former EA, Oculus and Zynga exec Mike Verdu as vice president of game development, Bloomberg has reported, and is set to add its first games to its subscription offering within the year.
There's no detail yet on what the mix of games will look like, to what extent Netflix will make its own original games, or whether any big franchises you've already heard of will be part of the plans.

Introduction
Are you interested in learning about what SIG Usability does and how you can get involved? Well, you're at the right place. SIG Usability is all about making Kubernetes more accessible to new folks, and its main activity is conducting user research for the community.

PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners will all be able to play together, with the option to opt-out of mixing PC and console groups if you so choose.
Separately, PS4 and Xbox One console players can also play together, but separate from other platforms. This makes sense, considering last-gen platforms feature 64 instead of 128-player matches.

I can accept that anti-piracy measures are a necessity, and I can equally accept that their sophistication these days may have a certain level of CPU overhead. However, putting out a game that has performance issues because of the DRM crosses a red line - it's something that a developer or publisher absolutely should not do.

For individual games, there's a new 85 percent revenue split for titles sold after 1st October up until the end of 2023, and up until the first $3m earned. This is similar to both Google and Apple's app store policies, which also take just 15 percent of the revenue cut compared to the industry standard 30 percent, up to a certain threshold.

Well, the team has provided us with another update video to show their progress, and they've now managed to recreate an entire PSone-style boss fight in Unreal Engine 4. 
Developer Lilith Walther, who's an Unreal Engine 4 tech artist and also lead programmer on indie JRPG Witch, shared a video of the boss fight on Twitter. It shows the player taking on Father Gascoigne, and features cutscenes, destructible gravestones and music produced on a Roland SC-88 for "maximum authenticity". You can take a look at the full video below:  
It's seriously impressive work, and personally I think the atmosphere in the "PSone" version feels even spookier than in the original game. The comparison video showing the same cutscene in Bloodborne and the demake is also well worth a watch:

This isn't just any old 3D model seen from a distance, however - the mod team is trying to make "one of the most detailed and accurate free 3D recreations of the Titanic ever made". Players will be able to explore the ship in freeroam mode, and the work done so far really does look stunning:
On top of all that, the mod even comes with its own storyline. It promises fully voice-acted missions, complete with cutscenes and a new soundtrack.

We want to make sure you're aware of some upcoming removals. These are

A raft of popular Warzone streamers were shocked to see their accounts hit the maximum level 1000 while playing last night, and all Black Ops Cold War weapons in the game hit maximum level, complete with all camos unlocked.
Yes, even the incredibly difficult to obtain Dark Matter camos for these weapons were unlocked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG Mobile really has been through the wringer in India: its popularity in the country led to concerns that children were spending too long playing the game, and several Indian cities placed bans on the game in 2019 after blaming it for promoting violent behaviour. Then, in 2020, PUBG Mobile was banned across the entire country following increased tensions between China and India. As the game was published by Chinese company Tencent, PUBG Mobile was included in the list of 118 apps banned in India over security concerns. 
But it seems PUBG Corp wasn't quite ready to give up, and a new version of the game is already seeing massive success. 
Battlegrounds Mobile India is the new (but still not particularly catchy) name of PUBG Mobile in India, and it's off to a roaring start. The game launched on 2nd July, and now has 34 million registered players, 16m daily active users, and a peak concurrent player count of 2.4 million. And apparently it's not even on the Apple App Store yet (via Times of India).

In a post on the Frontier forum, chief David Braben said the studio accepts the "frustration" players have had with the Odyssey expansion since it came out in May.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched, quickly accruing a 'Mostly Negative' rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.

Square Enix's role-playing adventure, which launched on PC in December 2015, received an update to fix an issue with Lightning's voice not being played in some scenes, according to a note on Steam.
How random! Or is it? As many fans have already speculated, this update may be more about tidying up the game ahead of a launch into Xbox Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn has been battling hackers in its online games for some time, but the situation escalated recently when hackers blocked players from accessing Apex Legends in order to complain about hacking in Titanfall. And unfortunately it seems the saga is having an impact on Respawn's development plans, with work on at least one highly-anticipated feature for Apex Legends, cross-progression, slowed by the recent spate of attacks.  
Earlier this week Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier responded to a question about cross-progression on Twitter, explaining that "recent hacks on Apex and TF have slowed down the progress of it". He added that the studio needed to "context switch to solving live game issues". 
Although cross-platform play was implemented in Apex Legends last year, players have so far been unable to transfer progress between accounts on different platforms (aside from moving between Steam and Origin). It's a feature the team seems eager to introduce, with Grenier explaining via Reddit that implementing it will be "much harder post-launch since users may have multiple accounts to merge or use". Given the ongoing problems with hacking in Apex Legends and the Titanfall games, it sounds like it could be a little while longer before we see this feature implemented.

In a series of tweets this morning, Kojima compared the typical use of the term Director's Cut in the movie business, and what had happened here. 
Kojima's reasoning is the PlayStation 5 version's new features were all developed after the original Death Stranding released, rather than it being a new version of the game assembled from cut content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a week of weird and wonderful speedruns, this year's Summer Games Done Quick event came to an end on Sunday - with a total of $2.8m (£2m) raised for charity. 
This year the online speedrunning event was raising money for Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières), a charity that provides medical assistance to those affected by conflict, disasters, epidemics or exclusion from healthcare. The donations from the latest event mean that Games Done Quick has now raised over $34m (£24.5m) for charity in total. 
As you may have noticed from Twitter, one of the highlights of this year's Summer Games Done Quick was a GeoGuessr speedrun, in which player Havrd managed to figure out his locations with remarkable accuracy. The Pokémon Black and White any percentage race between PulseEffects and Swiftalu, meanwhile, came down to the last five seconds. You can check out both of these highly entertaining speed runs below - or check out the full catalogue of runs on GDQ's YouTube channel.

Still, interest in rare or vintage video games is on the rise. The previous record was set only last week, for an unopened NES copy of the original Legend of Zelda. That went for $878k (£633k).

"All in-game shutters like the one from when you kill a zombie are fixed because Capcom DRM's entry points are patched out so most of their functions are never executed anymore," explained hacker Empress, who claims playing a pirated version of the game without Capcom's anti-tamper V3 and Denuvo V11 "results in [a] much smoother game experience".
DSO Gaming tested the theory for themselves and played a two-hour snippet of a cracked version. Despite killing numerous enemies, they said they "did not get a single stutter during these two hours".

As reported by Politico (thanks, TheGamer), the lawsuit - which was filed on Wednesday, 7th July 2021 in California and led by Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah - reportedly challenges the megacorp's control of the Android app store.
The filing takes umbrage with Google's plans to take a 30 per cent cut of all digital goods and services sold via its Play Store from September and is just one of several ongoing litigation battles taken out against the company over Google's perceived search engine and advertising monopolies.

Dallas, Texas-based Heritage Auctions said this cart is an early production copy of the first game in the Zelda series, and "is no doubt the apotheosis of rarity, cultural significance, and collection centerpieces".

And here it is now!
As part of tonight's WitcherCon, a livestream collaboration between CD Projekt and Netflix, the streaming service has announced that the long-awaited second season of its live-action Witcher TV series will arrive on 17th December this year.
That means fans will have been waiting almost exactly two years by the time Season 2 arrives (its predecessor debuted in December 2019), with the long gap between seasons largely the result of coronavirus-related filming delays. With filming wrapped and post-production now well underway, though, Netflix is finally ready to talk specifics and has confirmed Season 2 will once again consist of eight episodes, all of which have now had their official names revealed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's animated Witcher movie, Nightmare of the Wolf, will officially arrive on 23rd August, and there's a first look at its action in a new teaser trailer to celebrate the news.
Announced back at the start of last year, Nightmare of the Wolf focusses on Geralt of Rivia's friend and mentor Vesemir, and is set "long before" the two meet. In fact, previous word from Netflix suggests it'll wind the action all the way back to the start of Vesemir's journey as a Witcher, "after the mysterious Deglan claims him through the Law of Surprise".
And if that's left you sufficiently intrigued, you can see Netflix's first teaser trailer for Nightmare of the Wolf below. Animation is being handled by Studio Mir - the team behind Legend of Korra - while Lauren S. Hissrich and Beau DeMayo, respectively showrunner and writer on the main live-action Witcher series, are both involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video game collector has come across what is believed to be evidence of the "SNK Millennium" console - 20 years after it was rumoured to be in the works.
Anthony Bacon, from Chicago (who we've featured multiple times on Eurogamer before), was sent a mystery SNK motherboard earlier this year and asked to investigate by its owner.
This board had a long journey to Bacon's desk. His friend, Brian Hargrove, bought a lot of SNK motherboards from Yahoo Auctions Japan 15 years ago, not having any idea what they were. He sold the board in question to a friend of his called Max, who five months ago contacted Bacon to ask if he could work out what it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snowman and Land & Sea has announced that Alto's Odyssey, the endless sand-surfing game from 2018, is getting a special edition. Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City comes to Apple Arcade on 16th July.
The Lost City is a sort of revisiting of the original game, allowing players to "venture deeper into the endless desert to uncover its best-kept secret." The game adds a new biome - the Lost city - and expands upon the original design with new secrets and challenges. The idea is to give returning players something fresh to tease at, while allowing new players to see what the game's all about in the first place.
The teaser trailer promises lavish mystery and paper lanterns - always a lovely mix. If you have played the original game, your save data will carry across too, which is pretty great. Can't wait for this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane Studios, the developer behind the likes of Dishonored and Prey, has been teasing Deathloop for quite some time now, and the wonderfully stylish recursive stealth shooter has looked captivating at every turn. And the tantalising glimpses continued tonight with nine new minutes of gameplay footage, as shown during Sony's latest PlayStation State of Play.
First, the basic premise for those unfamiliar; in Deathloop, players take on the role of Colt, an assassin who finds himself trapped in an endless time loop on the mysterious Blackreef island. In order to escape, he'll need to take out eight targets known as the Visionaries before the day ends - but if he fails (or dies) time rewinds and he'll need to start over.
All isn't lost, however; by exploring further in each successive loop, players can gain valuable clues they'll be able to use next time around to locate and eliminate their targets before the day ends - and Arkane's latest gameplay footage focusses on an attempt to bring down the Visionary known as Aleksis "The Wolf" Dorsey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Megagon Industries' wonderfully serene (and deliciously infuriating) mountain bike adventure Lonely Mountains: Downhill is a brilliant thing, but given that it's also a year and a half old now, fans may be hoping for a bit of a shake-up. And what do you know? Megagon's newest update is here to do just that, wafting away the threat of encroaching staleness with a range of new Daily Ride challenge modifiers.
Daily Rides, if you've not yet checked them out, are daily cross-platform leaderboards that challenge players to do their best in a randomly selected trial, with participants able to unlock various cosmetic rewards, refreshed each season, along the way. Today's update marks the start of Lonely Mountains' seventh season, Summer Strolls, and introduces those aforementioned modifiers to freshen things up for players.
Today's Daily Ride, for instance, rolls out the new Changed Checkpoints modifier - which, as its name suggests, changes and adds new checkpoints to the trail - but future modifiers for the season have also been revealed (and you can see a few of them in the trailer below).

This Time It's Virtual (Sam & Max's first entirely new video game outing since Telltale Games' The Devil's Playhouse in 2010) is the work of developer HappyGiant, which promisingly includes Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell and a number of ex-LucasArts alumni who all worked on the studio's seminal 1993 point-and-click adventure Sam & Max: Hit the Road - writer/designer Mike Stemmle, creative director Mike Levine, and concept artist Peter Chan.
Additionally, David Nowlin and Dave Boat, who've voiced Sam and Max previously in a number of Telltale titles, are reprising their roles as the dubious dog and bunny duo.

<blockquote><p>This weekend&#8217;s attack was carried out with almost surgical precision. According to Cybereason, the REvil affiliates first gained access to targeted environments and then used the zero-day in the Kaseya Agent Monitor to gain administrative control over the target&#8217;s network. After writing a base-64-encoded payload to a file named agent.crt the dropper executed it.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The ransomware dropper Agent.exe is signed with a Windows-trusted certificate that uses the registrant name &#8220;PB03 TRANSPORT LTD.&#8221; By digitally signing their malware, attackers are able to suppress many security warnings that would otherwise appear when it&#8217;s being installed. Cybereason said that the certificate appears to have been used exclusively by REvil malware that was deployed during this attack...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-07-08T01:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Souls 3 has just received a new lease of life on Xbox Series consoles, thanks to the transformative powers of FPS Boost. The From Software classic now targets 60 frames per second on the new wave of Microsoft consoles, replacing the somewhat wobbly 30fps of the Xbox One rendition of the game. We had early access to the FPS Boosted rendition of the game and it certainly does the job, delivering nigh-on flawless performance on Xbox Series consoles.
This is a much-requested upgrade for Xbox Series X and S owners, bringing the game closer into line with its performance profile on PS5. Dark Souls 3 released on last-gen systems in 2016 with a firm 30fps cap, but many months later, a PlayStation 4 Pro patch removed the limit, offering frame-rates up to 60fps. Unfortunately, the value of the upgrade was questionable at the time, owing to a highly variable level of performance on Sony's enhanced machine. However, in the long run, it worked out - PlayStation 5's backwards compatibility horsepower locks the game to 1080p60.
Unfortunately, From Software never went back to the Xbox One version of Dark Souls 3 to add One X support, meaning that 900p30 has been the upper limit of performance on Xbox consoles since the game's original launch. Not only that, in common with From's other 30fps console offerings, inconsistent frame-pacing added a certain degree of judder to the game, something baked into the engine that extra back-compat horsepower could not address. Today's FPS Boost upgrade overrides the frame-rate cap to give Xbox Series X and S the same, smooth experience 60fps as PS5, with no judder, hitches or stuttering.

Frostpunk launched on consoles toward the end of 2019, introducing its narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder - in which players must overcome gruelling conditions to keep their fledgling community alive in a desolate sub-zero world - to a legion of new fans.
Since then, three distinctive expansions have released on PC, building upon Frostpunk's punishing but wonderfully compelling core in interesting new ways, and it's these that will finally debut on consoles later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch owners with a taste for cracking yarns, urban fantasy, and a smattering of demonic possession have a bit of a treat in store; developer Wadjet Eye's superb point-and-click adventure Unavowed is available on Nintendo's platform from today.
Unavowed - which is the work of Dave Gilbert, the designer behind Wadjet Eye's renowned Blackwell series - was enormously well-received when it released on PC back in 2018, receiving much acclaim for its ambitious structure and wonderfully compelling storyline.
It sees players taking on the role of a (somewhat definable) character who's spent the last year terrorising New York City in a demonically possessed frenzy - and who now, after intervention from a crack team of supernatural specialists, finds themselves in the employ of an ancient, evil-battling secret society and ready to put their recent mistakes right.

Warzone Tracker was one of a number of overlay apps on the Overwolf network that were disabled earlier this year following an update to the battle royale.
This update, issued in response to an Activision API terms of service breach by a separate app on the Overwolf framework, had the knock-on effect of blocking Overwolf entirely, preventing its use while the PC version of Warzone was in use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nacon has delayed the release of Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong. Originally scheduled to arrive this year, the narrative RPG is now due to launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and PC in February 2022.
Swansong, which was announced back in 2019, is the work of Big Bad Wolf, the studio behind episodic adventure game The Council, and places players into the shoes of three different vampires, each belonging to a different clan within the vampire sect of The Camarilla.
"Weaving between their intertwined tales," Nacon explained at the time of Swansong's reveal, "the player has to confront the different points of view of his characters to unravel fact from fiction. With whispers of conspiracy, murder and power struggles, the player must protect his clan, discover the truth and above all enforce the Masquerade, the vampire law designed to conceal the existence of creatures of the night from humans."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiders - the French studio behind the scrappy but lovable RPG likes of GreedFall and The Technomacer - has shared first gameplay footage of its offbeat new action-RPG, Steelrising.
Steelrising, if you're unfamiliar, features a deliciously high-concept premise, unfolding in a heavily reimagined version of 18th century Paris, where players are cast as Aegis, one of Marie Antoinette's automaton bodyguards, and charged with tracking down their maker in a bid to stop Louis XVI's army of rogue robots.
Steelrising got its big reveal last summer, when Spiders shared a wonderfully atmospheric teaser trailer offering a glimpse of Paris' battle-ravaged streets and glorious automaton creations. And now, following a second cinematic trailer in June, the developer has provided a first look at Steelrising's gameplay, predominantly focussing on its flashy third-person combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been quite some time since iconic 80s action-movie antihero RoboCop had a video game to call his own (he last appeared on PC and consoles over 18 years ago, re-emerging with a free-to-play mobile offering in 2014), but it's been revealed everybody's favourite cyborg security professional will be making a long-awaited gaming comeback in RoboCop: Rogue City.
RoboCop: Rogue City, which is set for release on PC and currently unannounced consoles some time in 2023, is the work of developer Teyon (the studio responsible for the critically savaged Terminator: Resistance and Rambo: The Video Game), and will feature an "original story" based on the events of the first three RoboCop films.
Beyond the fact that players will take on the role of  RoboCop himself - "Become the iconic hero whose [sic] part man, part machine, all cop as you attempt to bring justice to the dangerous, crime-ridden streets of Old Detroit in RoboCop: Rogue City," teases publisher Nacon in its press release - specifics are currently a little scarce.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known for a while that Kylotonn Racing is working on an all-new Test Drive Unlimited, and now we finally know where it'll be set, with Hong Kong set to be the backdrop for the open world racer. 
The location was revealed in today's Nacon Connect with another CGI trailer which teased some further details including a doubling down on the bling-obsessed lifestyle elements. We also got to see what the backdrop of Hong Kong will offer, from its muddy shores to its hyper-colourful streets through to its glorious hills. 
Hong Kong has been a popular destination for previous video games, of course, from Shenmue 2 to the beloved Sleeping Dogs. It follows on from Test Drive Unlimited's Oahu setting, while its sequel headed to Ibiza (and missed out on the opportunity for a Wayne Lineker cameo - for shame).

The Witcher: Blood Origin is a new six-part series set 1,200 years before Netflix's Henry-Cavill-starring main Witcher show and will chart the creation of the prototype Witcher, as well as the events leading to the "pivotal" Conjunction of the Spheres - in which a collision of different realms brought monsters into the world. 
Lauren S. Hissrich, showrunner on Netflix's mainline Witcher series, will executive produce Blood Origin, and Declan de Barra - who penned The Witcher Season 1's "Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials" episode - will serve as writer and showrunner on the prequel.

There's a new dock, too, with a wired LAN port.  White and neon red/blue colours will be available. Officially, it's called the Nintendo Switch (OLED model) console. In the US it costs $350. In the UK, we're yet to see local pricing.
We and others had expected Nintendo to push the button (flip the Switch?) and reveal its new model before E3. Nintendo really doesn't like leaks! Anyway, on time or not, here we are:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, has announced a second paid expansion, titled Ideology, which'll be arriving in the next few weeks alongside a substantial free content update for all players.
Following on from last year's Royalty DLC, Ideology aims to enhance RimWorld's celebrated core by providing the tools needed to fashion a specific belief system for your colony. "You can play as tree-worshipping cannibals who carve skulls into every piece of furniture," explains developer Tynan Sylvester on Steam, "or blind tunnelers who shun the light, or transhumanists obsessed with perfecting the human form using exotic technology. Or be nudists, or drug-stupor mystics, or piratical raiders, or charity-focused givers, or pain-loving animal sacrificers, or dance-party techno ravers, or rustic ranching cowboys, or many many more."
Sylvester says it'll be possible to mix and match different core elements of a colony's belief system in Ideology, and that customisation can be taken even further if desired, with the expansion enabling players to individually adjust preferences in the following categories: precept, ritual, special social role, venerated animal and weapon, culture and style, unique building, tattoo, clothing, background narrative, god, and, perhaps most importantly of all, beard (more on those shortly!).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streaming service PlayStation Now offers a huge library of games for PlayStation users giving hundreds of PS4 titles to download and play instantly. 
The biggest and arguably best game coming this month is Red Dead Redemption 2, which follows the story of outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang. It is full of shootouts, heists, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with NCPs, and maintaining Arthur's honour through the choices you choose. The action-adventure game will be available on Tuesday, 6th June.
Judgment, from the same team that created the Yakuza series, is a spin off series that follows a detective investigating a string of murders. The game will be available for three months, from 6th June until the 4th October 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series will not release anytime soon, according to reports. 
Grand Theft Auto 6 is still at least three or four years away, according to Battlefield insider Tom Henderson, who last week suggested GTA6 would not see a release until at least 2024 or 2025. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has now said he has heard similar.
The long wait, Henderson said, was due to a push within developer Rockstar to improve staff welfare and avoid the levels of crunch which have plagued the company over past releases. It is also, Henderson continued, because Rockstar wants to launch GTA6 at a time when the install base for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has grown considerably.

Might & Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for the game - leaving some unable to access significant portions of its single-player content and its DLC.
And, as Emma reported last month, despite these issues, the game and its DLC were left on sale. No more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new mod for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition has fixed the series' infamous save bug involving Conrad Verner - the infamous Shepard fan who loves to bug you.
The glitch caused Mass Effect 2 to incorrectly remember how you had treated Verner in Mass Effect 1, if you were nice to him. Catching up with Verner a second time, he would always react like you had put a gun in his face to get him to desist from acting like a trained N7 recruit for his own good. 
BioWare likely left this bug unpatched in the Legendary Edition as it later retconned Verner's glitched response in Mass Effect 3, where Verner apologises if he had misremembered Shepard's earlier actions.

Affected players are seemingly unable to access other game modes, essentially blocking them from playing at all.

The new record - which coincided with a 40 per cent off Steam sale and the recent release of a bunch of Resident Evil-themed goodies, including new skins and a new killer - saw 105,093 players jump on Steam at the same time, according to SteamDB.
The milestone also comes at the same time the asymmetric horror game, developed by Behaviour Interactive, is running an time-limited event from now until 15th July, during which there's a load of new content up for grabs, including anniversary crowns, community challenges, and enough Iridescent Shards for all players to purchase an "entire original character" of their choice.

This lot, called a "NES R" variant, is particularly significant because this version was "only produced for a few months in late 1987". Rev-A replaced it in early 1988.
The only version considered more valuable than this one is a "NES TM", and there's reportedly only one sealed copy in existence "and there is no telling whether or not that copy will ever come to market". Therefore, this cartridge is likely "the earliest sealed copy one could realistically hope to obtain" and sits at a grading - or wata rating - of 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios has published seven minutes of gameplay of its System Shock remake.
The System Shock video, below, includes plenty of skulking about in the Research level of Citadel Station.
I think it looks pretty impressive - the visuals are appropriately atmospheric, with plenty of sparky visual effects. There's a sense of foreboding, which System Shock should have. We see enemies who lurch towards the player once they're disturbed. The video ends with a quite terrifying fight against a large robot who takes an age to go down.

The headline announcement is the End of Dragons expansion has been delayed from late 2021 to early 2022. In a post on the Guild Wars 2 website, ArenaNet director John Taylor explained the delay:
"As expansion development has progressed and the real-world challenges of the past year and a half have changed the way we live and work, it's become clear that we need a little more time to deliver our creative vision for Cantha. As a result, we're delaying the release of Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons from late 2021 to early 2022.

The Dungeons & Dragons action role-playing game launched on 22nd June and was met with a mixed reception, so there are a lot of eyeballs on this first patch to see if it remedies some of the game's more immediate issues.
Unfortunately, developer Tuque Games' patch notes for Dark Alliance v1.16 are so vague, players are struggling to work out what the update actually does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom Eternal will no longer receive its previously announced PvP-focussed Invasions mode, with id Software having made the decision to pivot development toward a new single-player horde mode instead, due to coronavirus-related development challenges.
Invasions Mode, announced back at QuakeCon 2018, was intended to deliver a vaguely Dark-Souls-esque multiplayer spin on Doom Eternal's single-player campaign, enabling other humans to manifest as demons throughout the story and do battle with the host player for some added challenge.
Well over 12 months after Doom Eternal's March 2020 launch, however, Invasions Mode is still yet to materialise, leaving fans to ponder its fate. And now, in a newly released statement, id Software executive producer Marty Stratton has provided an answer, confirming Invasions Mode is officially dead due to the impact "the unforeseen consequences of the pandemic and remote working" have had on development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, the second game in Capcom's RPG spin-off series, comes to Switch and PC next Friday, 9th July, and, much like its mainline sibling, will enjoy a healthy dose of post-launch support. And now, with its arrival in sight, Capcom has shared a roadmap outlining those post-release content plans.
One week after Monster Hunter Stories 2's launch, Capcom will deploy its first (and previously detailed) post-launch update, introducing introducing Monster Hunter Rise's dog-like Palamute companion as a rideable Monstie.
That'll be followed by a second update on 5th August introducing Hellblade Glavenus and Boltreaver Astalos as new Monsties, alongside a new co-op quest - featuring the gilded Elder Dragon Kulve Taroth - that Monster Riders can tackle together. Capcom notes that while the Elder Dragon won't be rideable, materials gained from the quest can be used to craft "powerful" new equipment.

The news was announced via a blog post, where the company explained that the change was necessary for the implementation of its collections system. From now on, mod files will be archived instead of deleted, which will make them "inaccessible unless directly requested eg. via the API."
"It is our core belief that making modding easier is a noble goal, so more people can enjoy our joint hobby," Nexus Mods said. "We are convinced that our collections system, a project we have spent almost two years and many work-hours on, is the way to achieve this goal."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humble Bundle faced criticism earlier this year when it tried to remove charity sliders from its bundle pages, a decision that would have severely limited the amount players could donate to charity for their purchases. Following significant backlash, Humble Bundle decided to reverse this decision and reinstate the sliders - but it's once again placing limits on how much can be donated to charity. 
In a blog post, Humble Bundle announced it will be rolling out a "new iteration" of sliders in mid-July. "While splits on each bundle will vary, on average there will be a minimum amount for Humble Bundle between 15-30 percent," the post said. This means users will no longer be able to donate the entire amount to charity, although the company said there will continue to be some "100 percent to charity bundles". 
The company explained that the "PC storefront landscape has changed significantly" since the bundles began in 2010, and it had to "continue to evolve with it to stay on mission.

Monster Slayer is set long before the main Witcher games, meaning you need to step up and take on the fantasy world's many beasties yourself. 
CD Projekt first announced Monster Slayer in August last year, and said that its mobile studio Spokko was on development duties. It promised "rich, story-driven quests" and first-person monster battles impacted by your local time of day and weather. So, rain.

Venturebeat - which first reported on potential plans for a deal between the two back in April - say discussions have now progressed to the stage that a letter of intent has been signed while legal teams hash out the finer details. 
This leaves development work to continue (and Xbox boss Phil Spencer to continue displaying a Kojima Productions figurine on his shelf) in the meantime.

The new expansion, titled Legacy of the Sith, was announced in a livestream last night. It's due to add a mixture of additional story content, player rewards and new gameplay features.  
"The war between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire spreads to new worlds," the announcement post explains. "Dangerous fringe groups rise in the dark corners of the galaxy ​and Darth Malgus pursues an unknown plan... Unravel these mysteries and more as your choices continue to shape the galaxy."

PlayStation confirmed the situation in an update to its support page for discontinued apps and services this week, first noticed by ResetEra, and then confirmed by Kotaku.
So, while the PSP will still lose its purchasing functionality as planned, PSP games will still be available to play - a key concern among fans worried over Sony's perceived lack of care for game preservation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the many highlights of Satoru Iwata's reign at Nintendo was his series of Iwata Asks interviews - intimate, insightful and always entertaining chats between the president and the developers that started in the Wii era and carried on until Iwata's untimely death in 2015, they're some of the finest pieces of games journalism online. 
After an understandable hiatus, Nintendo has introduced a new similarly-themed series simply called 'Ask the Developer', with the first installment focussing on the recently released Game Builder Garage. It's a gentle, informative and enlightening read, even if it's short on any major revelations (although it's opened my eyes to the stylish lab coats all Nintendo developers seem to wear at the moment). 
The interview comes as Game Builder Garage gets a free demo on Nintendo Switch, with the first of its seven lessons now available to download from the eShop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mario Kart Live Home Circuit, the curious and enjoyable AR-offshoot for Nintendo's much-loved racing series that first released in October last year, has just got a substantial new update that introduces a whole new cup and various other elements. 
The 1.1.0 update, which went live yesterday, introduces the all-new Mario Cup, and upon its completion you're given access to new environments and gates to use in your course creations. There's also new kart elements, with 'Super Yoshi' and 'Yoshi Horn' up for grabs. 
Mario Kart Live Home Circuit was the work of Velan Studios, who've gone on to find further success with this year's Knockout City. Home Circuit wasn't without its limitations, but it was still a fascinating and frequently charming thing.  "A neatly crafted gizmo, and a fresh reminder that Nintendo remains a toymaker at heart," we wrote in our Mario Kart Live Home Circuit review.

Asobo offered a look the huge performance improvements coming to Microsoft Flight Simulator on PC during its latest developer livestream, with CEO Sebastian Wloch explaining the team has rewritten "a lot of the parts of the engine...in order to get the maximum performance out of the sim", as part of its work on the upcoming console version.
To illustrate just how effective Asobo's engine tweaks have been, Wloch demoed a before-and-after gameplay video featuring a flyover of Manhattan, captured from a PC equipped with an i7-9700K CPU and Nvidia 2060 Super graphics card - and running Flight Simulator at Ultra settings in 4K with a 40% render scale (jump to the 8-minute mark below to see the footage).

The Sims 4: Cottage Living, which arrives on 22nd July, is the tenth full-scale Expansion Pack (and 42nd bit of paid DLC) to launch for life sim since its release in 2014, and - as its name very much implies - is all about cosy cottages and rustic charm.
Unsurprisingly, top of the list of features coming in Cottage Living is the ability to settle down in a charmingly rustic new abode. Here, players can befriend the likes of wild rabbits, foxes, and birds, while also raising their own animals - including llamas, chickens, and cows for wool, eggs, and milk respectively - in order to start their journey to self-sufficiency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having spent some time percolating in the rumour pool (and occasionally leaking onto various ratings boards around the world), developer Sucker Punch's "director's cut" of its acclaimed open-world stealth-action game Ghost of Tsushima is now official, and coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 20th August.
Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, as the new edition is formally known, features all the content from the original release, alongside a new chapter in protagonist Jin's story, which will see him travel to Tsushima's neighbouring island of Iki.
"In this new story," Sucker Punch explains on the PlayStation Blog, "Jin travels to the island to investigate rumours of a Mongol presence. But soon, he finds himself caught up in events with deeply personal stakes that will force him to relive some traumatic moments from his past."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that Team Fortress 2 has a bit of a bot problem, but the game also has a community that really enjoys mid-match shenanigans - and the two combined today in one of the funniest posts about TF2 bots I've seen so far. 
Reddit user 2Noel posted footage of an Attack/Defend match in which Blu team was pitted against a bunch of bots - normally not great news for those wanting to keep their heads on their shoulders. Yet the team decided to try a different tactic to just charging into battle, instead choosing to conga their way out of spawn and onto the control points. And surprisingly, it worked. Stay tuned for the satisfying bot slaughter at the end of the match:  
The question you're probably asking right now is: why didn't the bots shoot the Blu team members? The answer, it seems, is that the bots are programmed to avoid shooting players who are using taunts and emotes. If you look closely at the video, you'll notice that players not engaged in the conga line (such as poor old atomdotdat) are instantly sniped by the bots, while the dancers remain unharmed.

But it is those horns which are causing a problem for some fans, who have said the mischievous god's headpiece simply blocks too much of their view.
I've played a few games now as Loki and haven't seen as much of an issue as the images being shared on reddit, such as the one below. I think this is probably angled to make the problem look as bad as possible, although yes, Loki's enormous helmet is certainly quite distracting.

Here&#8217;s one more contribution to that issue: a <a href="https://static.rusi.org/247-op-cyber-insurance-v2.pdf">research paper</a> that the insurance industry is hurting more than it&#8217;s helping.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, the most pressing challenge currently facing the industry is ransomware. Although it is a societal problem, cyber insurers have received considerable criticism for facilitating ransom payments to cybercriminals. These add fuel to the fire by incentivising cybercriminals&#8217; engagement in ransomware operations and enabling existing operators to invest in and expand their capabilities. Growing losses from ransomware attacks have also emphasised that the current reality is not sustainable for insurers either...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Iron Gate recently made a change to enemy AI that made monsters much more aggressive towards buildings, and players started to complain the monsters had become a bit too rowdy. Enemies were seen running past players to destroy their buildings instead, while some monsters became so confused about what they should be attacking that they essentially froze in place. I checked the patch out for myself and discovered local greydwarfs had stripped our village walls of decorations, while a run-in with a troll ended in disaster when it became a bit too interested in my friend's treehouse:
In any case, it seems Iron Gate noticed the AI change was causing a fair bit of chaos, and the AI has been tweaked once again to solve the problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week we heard that several fan-made GoldenEye levels in Far Cry 5 had been pulled by Ubisoft following a copyright claim, but it seems the author has now reuploaded the levels under a new name - which will hopefully be enough to ensure the levels stay up in future. 
After confirming the levels had been pulled, creator Krollywood said a few days ago he intended to "change some details like names and re-upload them as soon as possible," and it seems that's now happened. Krollywood confirmed in a Reddit comment that the levels have been reuploaded to Far Cry 5's arcade mode under the name "Golden Cry". To find them on PS4 you'll need to search for the creator name "Perfect-Dark1982", and on PC the creator name is "Graslu00".
Krollywood spent two and a half years recreating the 18 GoldenEye 007 levels in Far Cry 5's level editor, and you can hear a little about how he did it in the video below:

In recent months players have reported increased DDoS attacks on Ranked games, with Respawn pledging to take "huge steps" to fix the problem. And we now have another update on what the studio is doing to combat cheaters, with Respawn hiring more people and developing new tools to keep them at bay. 
As explained on Twitter, Respawn said it's hiring "more people to focus on manual bans", and is also investigating new ways to catch and remove cheaters from games - presumably through automated tools. Respawn also specifically addressed the DDoS problem, saying it was "developing more tools to automatically detect and stop DDoS attacks". 
"Playing against cheaters sucks," said Respawn's Twitter account. "We'll keep you updated as we ship the above changes and pursue new ones."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG's much-teased Taego map has finally arrived on PC test servers, bringing with it some new features including self-revives and a special "second chance" mechanic. Well... new to PUBG, at least. 
The freshly-released patch notes explain that Taego is an 8x8 map set in 1980s South Korea, with landscapes "ranging from wide-open reed fields to the close quarters of Hosan Prison". It's also got some wildlife, with flocks of birds that react to player movement and gunfire, so take your binoculars with you - those birds might just help you track down another squad. If you stream yourself doing that, you're a twitcher in two senses of the word. 
The map also has a new feature called Comeback BR, which gives players who die before the first Blue Zone the ability to get themselves back into the game. All you have to do is stay alive in a separate "Comeback Arena" for a certain amount of time. It sounds pretty similar to Call of Duty: Warzone's Gulag, except it's more like another mini battle royale rather than a one-on-one battle to the death. Players who survive are reintroduced to the main game in phase three of the match, complete with all their items and gear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember those Call of Duty: Modern Warfare maps that were surprise-added (and then removed) earlier this year? Well, they're back once again, and hopefully they're going to stick around a bit longer this time. 
The returning multiplayer maps are Al-Raab Airbase (6v6) and Drainage (Gunfight), with the former being reintroduced as a 24/7 playlist, and the latter now available in the Gunfight and Gunfight - Snipers Only playlists. 
The maps were originally added to the game in an update back in March, a move that surprised players given Activision was expected to have switched focus to supporting Black Ops Cold War and Warzone. Al-Raab Airbase and Drainage were briefly available to play in private matches, but in April Activision removed the two maps, later explaining they needed more time in the oven. Anyway, they have now returned, and should help mix things up for those still playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever felt bad about keeping all your old files in a mess, here's something to make you feel better, as a much sought-after early version of Minecraft has finally been found - thanks to one player who made backups of her old laptop. Oh, and I guess this also means that tweeting everything is useful after all. 
As spotted by Kotaku, Twitter user @lunasorcery explained in a thread that she'd helped a group of Minecraft historians find a long-lost early version of the game. Build Alpha 1.1.1 was apparently a "long-running meme" and "holy grail" for Minecraft archivist group Omniarchive, as the historians had never been able to track the elusive build down. It was an exceedingly rare version of the game that was released on 18th September 2010, and was only available for three hours and 25 minutes due to a bug that would turn the player's screen grey. 
Luckily, someone spotted a 2010 tweet by Luna in which she discussed the Minecraft update, and messaged her to ask if she had a copy of the build. She initially ignored the message, thinking there was "no chance in hell" that she would still have a copy, but last Friday another person contacted her about the tweet - and this prompted her to take a closer look.

Given the growth and scale of the Kubernetes project, the existing reporting mechanisms were proving to be inadequate and challenging.
Kubernetes is a large open source project. With over 100000 commits just to the main k/kubernetes repository, hundreds of other code
repositories in the project, and thousands of contributors, there's a lot going on. In fact, there are 37 contributor groups at the time of
writing. We also value all forms of contribution and not just code changes.
With that context in mind, the challenge of reporting on all this activity was a call to action for exploring better options. Therefore

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Valheim developer Iron Gate rolled out a patch that was intended to provide players with an extra level of challenge: enemies were tweaked to be more aggressive towards structures, meaning players would have to be more proactive about defending their homes. But some players feel Iron Gate went overboard with these changes, highlighting that the patch has resulted in some strange enemy behaviour - along with the wanton destruction of property. 
Over on the Valheim subreddit, players have argued that Valheim's monsters are now too eager to attack buildings, sometimes opting to destroy structures even when standing directly next to the player. This has led to some "immersion-shattering" enemy behaviour, with monsters looking uncertain about who they should be attacking. Some players, meanwhile, are simply exasperated at the amount of damage now being caused in monster raids. 
"Earlier today I had a troll invasion and I had three trolls attacking my base non-stop," said Reddit user Squatch11. "I literally couldn't get them to attack me. Half of my base was destroyed before I managed to kill them."

The fan-created source code for both games was made available on GitHub, offering a raft of eye-catching improvements over the original games officially available to play today on PC. (For more, check out our feature on how re3 came to be.)

In an AMA on Reddit, spotted by TheGamer, the team dutifully answered a bunch of questions about the sequel, including one from a fan self-described as a "solely Switch player" who asked how the improved graphics and performance seen in recent reveals will translate to Nintendo's hardware.
The reply came from technical director, John Lafleur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mass Effect Legendary Edition has certainly done the trick: it's rekindled a love of BioWare's original trilogy years after the games came out. But it's not just Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3 that are being judged once again. Fans are reappraising Mass Effect Andromeda, too.
2017's Mass Effect Andromeda endured a torrid time upon release, with clips of dialogue scenes descending into meme status. There were other areas of the game that came under fire, including its limited character creator, bugs and animation quirks.
Beyond that, though, Andromeda's missions, storyline and characters failed to set the world on fire. Without Commander Shepard, the Normandy and the original trilogy's cast of much-loved characters, Andromeda set out for a new galaxy, a new premise and new party members. I think it's fair to say it didn't stick the landing. Some thought the game was just okay, others considered it outright awful. Either way, Andromeda flopped and BioWare soon moved on, leaving it sequel-less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has defeated WWE wrestler Booker T in a Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 likeness lawsuit.
Booker T. Huffman claimed unlicensed use of his character 'G.I. Bro' with the character 'Prophet' from Treyarch's Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 in a lawsuit filed in February 2019.
The lawsuit revolved around a poster Booker T commissioned and used to promote his 2015 comic, G.I. Bro and the Dragon of Death. The comic stars a "special operations hero called G.I. Bro". Prophet, from 2018's Black Ops 4, is a "cybernetically enhanced soldier". The image below compares the two characters:

Redditor Elpinko made this video after first creating a test version using just Family Guy characters. "I can say that I have spent the last three days perfecting and tweaking but honestly I got carried away," he said. 
The video was made by putting together different clips from the famous TV shows, using exclusively cartoon characters, to create a battle royale match. Elpinko took action scenes out of the shows and paired them against each other with Apex maps as the setting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news everyone, Konami's working on a brand new game - other than New Football Game Online Performance Test - and this one certainly looks intriguing. It's a "mystery simulation game" called Crimesight, where players must deduce "not only the culprit, but the victim as well". What, were you expecting Silent Hill? 
The social deduction game is set in a futuristic version of London where crimes can be predicted using an "analytical programme developed using data harvested online". This has led to reduced crime rates across the world, but the system predicts a crime that could "plunge the world into chaos", prompting the system's architects to create an AI called Sherlock to investigate and prevent this crime.
Sherlock must prevent the criminal mastermind AI (named Moriarty, of course) from committing simulated murder, while Moriarty will try to predict the perfect moment to murder an NPC avatar. The trailer explains that Crimesight allows for 2-4 person multiplayer, and that the game takes place on what looks like a virtual tabletop board.

In the video below, developer Massive Entertainment discusses how the team has improved its Snowdrop game engine - the one it used to build The Division - to make use of the more powerful hardware.
There's a lot of talk about ray tracing and object detail, which is great. And Avatar does look like quite the tech powerhouse - a game that will actually push those next-gen consoles. But my ears were pricked by something Alice Rendell, lead narrative realisation designer, mentioned too: Massive has created a system where NPCs understand the state of the world. For example, they're aware of the weather, player progression and time of day. That sounds pretty cool, and I'm already imagining NPCs complaining about the rain. It rains on Pandora, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft unveiled Windows 11 last night, and in doing so mentioned new gaming-focused features.
Windows 11 automatically adds high dynamic range (HDR) enhancements to games built on DirectX 11 or higher that previously only used standard dynamic range (SDR). HDR allows a supported game to render a much wider range of brightness values and colours. It's a tech already in the Xbox Series X and S. Microsoft mentioned over 1000 games will support auto HDR, including Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, Rocket League, DayZ, and even Doom 64.
Microsoft said Windows 11 will load new games faster via tech called DirectStorage. Again, this was a part of Xbox Series X and S tech. DirectStorage means games quickly load assets to the graphics card without bogging down the CPU. Microsoft  said to expect incredibly detailed game worlds rendered at "lightning speeds" and without long load times. "DirectStorage Optimised" Windows 11 PCs are configured with the hardware and drivers needed to enable this.

But it seems the studio has plans to work on a multiplayer project - although exactly what this could be is anyone's guess. 
A job advert posted by Insomniac on Twitter mentions the developer has "five new job openings for a multiplayer project". Insomniac is looking for a creative director, systems designer, story lead, art director and VFX artist. 
That doesn't give much away, but the systems designer job description does mention having a "thorough understanding of melee combat systems, enemy design and boss design" would be useful experience. The designer would help develop "combat, navigation, progression, and economy" for a multiplayer environment. Make of that what you will.

YouTuber Krollywood spent two-and-a-half years recreating Rare's seminal N64 first-person shooter inside the level editor provided within Far Cry 5, but this week Ubisoft removed the levels from the game's arcade mode after a copyright infringement claim reportedly issued by MGM.
All 18 GoldenEye campaign levels were remade and made available to play by anyone in Far Cry 5's arcade mode, even with the odd additional Easter egg. You can check out the Dam remake level in the video below:

2017's Sonic Mania, if it somehow managed to pass you by, sees developer Christian Whitehead and team serving up a sumptuous smorgasbord of classic side-scrolling platforming, meticulously designed to evoke the breathless left-right thrills of Sonic's 16-bit heyday. 
Brand-new stages sit alongside beloved classics taken from Sonic 1 through Sonic & Knuckles - all thoroughly, expertly remixed to form playful new challenges - and the package is topped off with vibrant visuals and a flawless soundtrack, both managing to perfectly capture the spirit of Sonic's original Mega Drive adventures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following various not-so-subtle teases from the Apex Legends Twitter account, Respawn has announced that the original Kings Canyon map is returning in an upcoming Collection Event. Oh, and everyone's favourite murder site, Skull Town, is being introduced as an Arenas map. 
The Genesis Collection Event kicks off on 29th June and lasts until 13th July, offering a bunch of new paid cosmetics (and what looks like an extremely cool Revenant scythe heirloom). As usual, you can acquire these by purchasing event packs or buying them directly with Apex Coins or Crafting Materials. You'll need to purchase all 24 items to unlock the Revenant heirloom - paying for all of that would certainly be the death of me. 
There are some freebies, however: players will be able to earn 1600 points per day in daily challenges as part of the event's rewards track. This includes legendary Charge Rifle and EVA-8 skins, along with a variety of charms. On top of this, there are some stretch challenges with special event badges as rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cowering in terror used to be one of my absolute favourite strategies during my early Valheim days, but from now on it seems that will be a less viable tactic. Developer Iron Gate is introducing some enemy AI tweaks to make monsters more aggressive, which should encourage them to start barging into your base. How rude.
The latest Valheim patch notes explain that the new update will fix several AI issues, with monsters made "slightly more aggressive". They will now "attack your buildings etc. when they are not able to attack you", meaning you'll probably have to be more proactive in taking out enemies before they destroy your beautiful wooden structures. "It's fun for the whole family," Iron Gate said in the patch notes. (Is it, though?)
If you're strolling through the Black Forest, you may also want to watch your head, as the Greydwarfs have had their aim improved - meaning they now have half a chance of actually getting a shot on target. A "long forgotten Blob event" has also been enabled, while bosses will no longer run from you. All in all, it sounds like the world of Valheim is getting a little more dangerous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's time for the latest chapter in Valve's ongoing battle with Team Fortress 2 bots: this week sees a new update that should, in theory, make bot behaviour slightly less annoying.
As detailed on the Team Fortress 2 updates page, TF2 was patched on Tuesday with a number of measures that should limit what bots get up to when in-game. There's now a tool to control how many times players can change their name in a match, for instance, and for public matchmaking it seems this has been set to zero - thus preventing bots from frequently changing their names or mimicking real players. 
The update also introduces a grace period at the start of matches to prevent players immediately calling votes, which should put the brakes on bots that are trying to deliberately clog up the vote-kick system. Similarly, players joining an in-progress game will face a cooldown before they can call a vote. Kick votes will also "end early and automatically pass if the vote target leaves the match during the vote".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might & Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for Might & Magic 10: Legacy - leaving some players unable to access significant portions of the game's single-player content and its DLC. And despite these issues, the game and its DLC are still on sale.
The server shutdown began on 1st June, after which players began to report problems accessing DLC areas from the game's The Falcon & The Unicorn expansion. Players who owned the DLC also found they were unable to play past Act 1 of the main game with the expansion installed. Some who bought the deluxe version reported they could no longer access the special in-game items included with that version (via PC Gamer). 
Players have been creating their own workarounds for the problems, with some editing NPC dialogue to do so, but so far there hasn't been an official fix. Ubisoft told Eurogamer it is "aware and investigating the reported issues with our internal teams".

According to a new post on Xbox Wire, Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game, developed by Digital Eclipse, was inspired by a number of fan-submitted idea picked as part of a competition held late last year. That ultimately led to the creation of a 90s-inspired arcade beat-'em-up in which Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, and LeBron James engage in some basketball-imbued brawling to defeat a virtual army controlled by a nefarious AI.

Sonic himself is actually a couple of years older. Like the Nintendo mascot he was engineered to replicate, Sonic first popped up elsewhere - in 1991 Sega arcade racer Rad Mobile - before getting his own game.

Using GameGAN, Kinsley collaborated with developer Daniel Kukieła on this two-month project, which followed a similar idea last year that recreated Pac-Man by watching another AI play through the game.
Neither of the two collaborators came in with much knowledge of GANs, Kinsley told Eurogamer. "It was a lot of trial and error and just small tweaks and seeing if and how they improved. We didn't have much knowledge, so we had a lot of learning to do, and still do."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After more than a year of gameplay bonuses designed to make Pokémon Go easier to play during the pandemic, developer Niantic has laid out a detailed roadmap for how it will remove, replace and adopt these changes in the future.
Some changes will be made permanent, though others - most notably the ability to interact with PokéStops and gyms at an increased distance - will be removed. 
But changes will be made on a country-by-country basis, Niantic has said, and in the short term there will be new temporary "exploration bonuses" for countries which lose the pandemic changes soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard shareholders have voted to approve boss Bobby Kotick's $155m pay packet after a controversial delay.
GamesIndustry.biz reports the say-on-pay vote, which had been delayed to this week in what was seen by some as an effort by Activision Blizzard to avoid an embarrassing slapdown, won approval from 54 percent of shareholders - down from the 56.8 percent approval seen last year, which itself was down from the 58 percent approval of 2019.
The decision comes following significant pressure from CtW, an investment company that "holds directors accountable for irresponsible and unethical corporate behaviour and excessive executive pay".

Speaking on his YouTube series Harada's Bar, Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada discussed the ill-fated project, which was announced 11 years ago in July 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Tekken X Street Fighter was a much-hyped crossover fighting game in development at Bandai Namco in collaboration with Street Fighter maker Capcom. It was meant to follow 2D fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken by mashing together characters from both series, this time in the 3D Tekken style.

<ul>
<li>Machine learning can help defenders more accurately detect and triage potential attacks. However, in many cases these technologies are elaborations on long-standing methods &#8212; not fundamentally new approaches &#8212; that bring new attack surfaces of their own.
<li>A wide range of specific tasks could be fully or partially automated with the use of machine learning, including some forms of vulnerability discovery, deception, and attack disruption. But many of the most transformative of these possibilities still require significant machine learning breakthroughs.

Well, while holding VR controllers, I guess. 
VHVR is a community-made VR mod for Valheim that was first released back in April, and did a pretty good job of translating Valehim's Viking world into VR (even if players could only move using a standard gamepad or mouse and keyboard). Here's our own Ian Higton trying it out at the time:
Work on the mod continued post-launch, and now VHVR has been given a game-changing update that adds motion control support. Thanks to the work of modder Maddy25 (who apparently almost single-handedly implemented many of the motion control systems), you can now interact with items in Valheim more directly. There's upper-body and finger tracking using VRIK, melee combat, bow and arrow controls, fishing, point and click building, and you can use your hands to interact with the environment. There are also custom VR controls for interacting with menus, along with switching and equipping items.
