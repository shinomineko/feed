Given the growth and scale of the Kubernetes project, the existing reporting mechanisms were proving to be inadequate and challenging.
Kubernetes is a large open source project. With over 100000 commits just to the main k/kubernetes repository, hundreds of other code
repositories in the project, and thousands of contributors, there's a lot going on. In fact, there are 37 contributor groups at the time of
writing. We also value all forms of contribution and not just code changes.
With that context in mind, the challenge of reporting on all this activity was a call to action for exploring better options. Therefore

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Valheim developer Iron Gate rolled out a patch that was intended to provide players with an extra level of challenge: enemies were tweaked to be more aggressive towards structures, meaning players would have to be more proactive about defending their homes. But some players feel Iron Gate went overboard with these changes, highlighting that the patch has resulted in some strange enemy behaviour - along with the wanton destruction of property. 
Over on the Valheim subreddit, players have argued that Valheim's monsters are now too eager to attack buildings, sometimes opting to destroy structures even when standing directly next to the player. This has led to some "immersion-shattering" enemy behaviour, with monsters looking uncertain about who they should be attacking. Some players, meanwhile, are simply exasperated at the amount of damage now being caused in monster raids. 
"Earlier today I had a troll invasion and I had three trolls attacking my base non-stop," said Reddit user Squatch11. "I literally couldn't get them to attack me. Half of my base was destroyed before I managed to kill them."

The fan-created source code for both games was made available on GitHub, offering a raft of eye-catching improvements over the original games officially available to play today on PC. (For more, check out our feature on how re3 came to be.)

In an AMA on Reddit, spotted by TheGamer, the team dutifully answered a bunch of questions about the sequel, including one from a fan self-described as a "solely Switch player" who asked how the improved graphics and performance seen in recent reveals will translate to Nintendo's hardware.
The reply came from technical director, John Lafleur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rating for the unannounced Castlevania Advance Collection has popped up again - this time in Korea.
It solidifies a leak that came to light last week, when the same title similarly popped up in Australia.
This time, H2 Interactive Co. Ltd submitted the game to the panel - in Australia, it was publisher and IP holder Konami itself - which has been awarded an ages 12 and up rating (thanks, VG24/7).

It's not the first time players have been able to double up as their favourite Avengers - it was first introduced via time-limited mode, The Tachyon Anomaly - but the feature proved so popular amongst the community that developer Crystal Dynamics is now introducing it permanently in a big update slated to come next month. 
"Due to your feedback, we're permanently turning on the ability to play multiple of the same Hero during matchmaking and when forming Strike Teams," the development team confirmed in a blog post, (thanks, TheGamer).

And then there's this, a Greggs in Far Cry 5.
Edinburgh-based artist Mojo Swoptops recreated our nation's sandwich shop in fine detail. It's got a Greggs-looking counter flanked not by fridges stuffed with sparsely-filled sandwiches but shelving units packed with fruit. The Greggs sign is pretty close, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mass Effect Legendary Edition has certainly done the trick: it's rekindled a love of BioWare's original trilogy years after the games came out. But it's not just Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3 that are being judged once again. Fans are reappraising Mass Effect Andromeda, too.
2017's Mass Effect Andromeda endured a torrid time upon release, with clips of dialogue scenes descending into meme status. There were other areas of the game that came under fire, including its limited character creator, bugs and animation quirks.
Beyond that, though, Andromeda's missions, storyline and characters failed to set the world on fire. Without Commander Shepard, the Normandy and the original trilogy's cast of much-loved characters, Andromeda set out for a new galaxy, a new premise and new party members. I think it's fair to say it didn't stick the landing. Some thought the game was just okay, others considered it outright awful. Either way, Andromeda flopped and BioWare soon moved on, leaving it sequel-less.

Variety reports lead showrunner Steven Kane will not return, should the show get picked up for a second season. Variety suggests a second season "seems likely... given the high-profile nature of the underlying IP and the high level of investment on ViacomCBS' part".
Kane has been in Budapest, where production of the Halo TV show is ongoing, for the past two years and wants to return to the states for "personal reasons".

In 2010 EA sold off the film rights to Legendary Pictures, with then BioWare bosses Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk set to work as executive producers alongside former Mass Effect chief Casey Hudson.

In a recent interview with Business Insider, BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained what happened.
"It felt like we were always fighting the IP," he said. "What story are we going to tell in 90 to 120 minutes? Are we going to do it justice?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fan has made a video imagining a battle royale with cartoon characters set in Apex Legends maps.
Redditor Elpinko made this video after first creating a test version using just Family Guy characters. "I can say that I have spent the last three days perfecting and tweaking but honestly I got carried away," he said. 
The video was made by putting together different clips from the famous TV shows, using exclusively cartoon characters, to create a battle royale match. Elpinko took action scenes out of the shows and paired them against each other with Apex maps as the setting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news everyone, Konami's working on a brand new game - other than New Football Game Online Performance Test - and this one certainly looks intriguing. It's a "mystery simulation game" called Crimesight, where players must deduce "not only the culprit, but the victim as well". What, were you expecting Silent Hill? 
The social deduction game is set in a futuristic version of London where crimes can be predicted using an "analytical programme developed using data harvested online". This has led to reduced crime rates across the world, but the system predicts a crime that could "plunge the world into chaos", prompting the system's architects to create an AI called Sherlock to investigate and prevent this crime.
Sherlock must prevent the criminal mastermind AI (named Moriarty, of course) from committing simulated murder, while Moriarty will try to predict the perfect moment to murder an NPC avatar. The trailer explains that Crimesight allows for 2-4 person multiplayer, and that the game takes place on what looks like a virtual tabletop board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a next-gen exclusive game - it's due out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and Stadia at some point in 2022 (assuming it doesn't get delayed). But what does being next-gen exclusive actually mean?
In the video below, developer Massive Entertainment discusses how the team has improved its Snowdrop game engine - the one it used to build The Division - to make use of the more powerful hardware.
There's a lot of talk about ray tracing and object detail, which is great. And Avatar does look like quite the tech powerhouse - a game that will actually push those next-gen consoles. But my ears were pricked by something Alice Rendell, lead narrative realisation designer, mentioned too: Massive has created a system where NPCs understand the state of the world. For example, they're aware of the weather, player progression and time of day. That sounds pretty cool, and I'm already imagining NPCs complaining about the rain. It rains on Pandora, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft unveiled Windows 11 last night, and in doing so mentioned new gaming-focused features.
Windows 11 automatically adds high dynamic range (HDR) enhancements to games built on DirectX 11 or higher that previously only used standard dynamic range (SDR). HDR allows a supported game to render a much wider range of brightness values and colours. It's a tech already in the Xbox Series X and S. Microsoft mentioned over 1000 games will support auto HDR, including Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, Rocket League, DayZ, and even Doom 64.
Microsoft said Windows 11 will load new games faster via tech called DirectStorage. Again, this was a part of Xbox Series X and S tech. DirectStorage means games quickly load assets to the graphics card without bogging down the CPU. Microsoft  said to expect incredibly detailed game worlds rendered at "lightning speeds" and without long load times. "DirectStorage Optimised" Windows 11 PCs are configured with the hardware and drivers needed to enable this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insomniac Games has largely focused on single-player titles over the last few years, producing big hits Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Marvel's Spider-Man for the PlayStation. But it seems the studio has plans to work on a multiplayer project - although exactly what this could be is anyone's guess. 
A job advert posted by Insomniac on Twitter mentions the developer has "five new job openings for a multiplayer project". Insomniac is looking for a creative director, systems designer, story lead, art director and VFX artist. 
That doesn't give much away, but the systems designer job description does mention having a "thorough understanding of melee combat systems, enemy design and boss design" would be useful experience. The designer would help develop "combat, navigation, progression, and economy" for a multiplayer environment. Make of that what you will.

Infinite's seasons will each last three months, which, according to Paradis, "gives players a good amount of time to experience and explore the seasonal content, without it getting tiresome and without constantly pulling the rug from under players."

YouTuber Krollywood spent two-and-a-half years recreating Rare's seminal N64 first-person shooter inside the level editor provided within Far Cry 5, but this week Ubisoft removed the levels from the game's arcade mode after a copyright infringement claim reportedly issued by MGM.
All 18 GoldenEye campaign levels were remade and made available to play by anyone in Far Cry 5's arcade mode, even with the odd additional Easter egg. You can check out the Dam remake level in the video below:

2017's Sonic Mania, if it somehow managed to pass you by, sees developer Christian Whitehead and team serving up a sumptuous smorgasbord of classic side-scrolling platforming, meticulously designed to evoke the breathless left-right thrills of Sonic's 16-bit heyday. 
Brand-new stages sit alongside beloved classics taken from Sonic 1 through Sonic & Knuckles - all thoroughly, expertly remixed to form playful new challenges - and the package is topped off with vibrant visuals and a flawless soundtrack, both managing to perfectly capture the spirit of Sonic's original Mega Drive adventures.

Oh, and everyone's favourite murder site, Skull Town, is being introduced as an Arenas map. 
The Genesis Collection Event kicks off on 29th June and lasts until 13th July, offering a bunch of new paid cosmetics (and what looks like an extremely cool Revenant scythe heirloom). As usual, you can acquire these by purchasing event packs or buying them directly with Apex Coins or Crafting Materials. You'll need to purchase all 24 items to unlock the Revenant heirloom - paying for all of that would certainly be the death of me. 
There are some freebies, however: players will be able to earn 1600 points per day in daily challenges as part of the event's rewards track. This includes legendary Charge Rifle and EVA-8 skins, along with a variety of charms. On top of this, there are some stretch challenges with special event badges as rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cowering in terror used to be one of my absolute favourite strategies during my early Valheim days, but from now on it seems that will be a less viable tactic. Developer Iron Gate is introducing some enemy AI tweaks to make monsters more aggressive, which should encourage them to start barging into your base. How rude.
The latest Valheim patch notes explain that the new update will fix several AI issues, with monsters made "slightly more aggressive". They will now "attack your buildings etc. when they are not able to attack you", meaning you'll probably have to be more proactive in taking out enemies before they destroy your beautiful wooden structures. "It's fun for the whole family," Iron Gate said in the patch notes. (Is it, though?)
If you're strolling through the Black Forest, you may also want to watch your head, as the Greydwarfs have had their aim improved - meaning they now have half a chance of actually getting a shot on target. A "long forgotten Blob event" has also been enabled, while bosses will no longer run from you. All in all, it sounds like the world of Valheim is getting a little more dangerous.

<blockquote><p>The challenges caused and entrenched by surveillance-based advertising include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>privacy and data protection infringements
<li>opaque business models
<li>manipulation and discrimination at scale
<li>fraud and other criminal activity
<li>serious security risks</ul>
<p>In the following chapters, we describe various aspects of these challenges and point out how today&#8217;s dominant model of online advertising is a threat to consumers, democratic societies, the media, and even to advertisers themselves. These issues are significant and serious enough that we believe that it is time to ban these detrimental practices...</p></li></li></li></li></li></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's time for the latest chapter in Valve's ongoing battle with Team Fortress 2 bots: this week sees a new update that should, in theory, make bot behaviour slightly less annoying.
As detailed on the Team Fortress 2 updates page, TF2 was patched on Tuesday with a number of measures that should limit what bots get up to when in-game. There's now a tool to control how many times players can change their name in a match, for instance, and for public matchmaking it seems this has been set to zero - thus preventing bots from frequently changing their names or mimicking real players. 
The update also introduces a grace period at the start of matches to prevent players immediately calling votes, which should put the brakes on bots that are trying to deliberately clog up the vote-kick system. Similarly, players joining an in-progress game will face a cooldown before they can call a vote. Kick votes will also "end early and automatically pass if the vote target leaves the match during the vote".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might & Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for Might & Magic 10: Legacy - leaving some players unable to access significant portions of the game's single-player content and its DLC. And despite these issues, the game and its DLC are still on sale.
The server shutdown began on 1st June, after which players began to report problems accessing DLC areas from the game's The Falcon & The Unicorn expansion. Players who owned the DLC also found they were unable to play past Act 1 of the main game with the expansion installed. Some who bought the deluxe version reported they could no longer access the special in-game items included with that version (via PC Gamer). 
Players have been creating their own workarounds for the problems, with some editing NPC dialogue to do so, but so far there hasn't been an official fix. Ubisoft told Eurogamer it is "aware and investigating the reported issues with our internal teams".

According to a new post on Xbox Wire, Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game, developed by Digital Eclipse, was inspired by a number of fan-submitted idea picked as part of a competition held late last year. That ultimately led to the creation of a 90s-inspired arcade beat-'em-up in which Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, and LeBron James engage in some basketball-imbued brawling to defeat a virtual army controlled by a nefarious AI.
"Fortunately," explains Microsoft, "our heroes have access to a variety of moves, including a special basketball, and some rather unique Space Jam cards, to help them out."

One of the defendants was discovered to have been employed at LSC Communications, the company which had printed the Pokémon Sword and Shield strategy guide. The other defendant was identified as the individual who had then received photos of the guide via a group chat and posted them onto Discord, making them public.

Tencent first acquired a small stake in the company back in February 2020. At the time, Yager said it would put the funds towards its free-to-play multiplayer game The Cycle, and then unnamed future projects.
Today's news was revealed in an interview with Yager boss Timo Ullmann by German site gameswirtschaft.de, and picked up by Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad. In it, Ullmann says the move comes ahead of a relaunch for The Cycle based on early access feedback.

Developer Raven made a change to the skin for the start of Season 4, and it has brightened up what was a very dark outfit for operator Roze.
Activision's battle royale has for months come under fire for a particular skin for Roze, which many considered "pay-to-win".

Get beamed up and you'll find yourself in a mini dungeon filled with locations from the past to hop around in low-gravity. (I am delighted to see the return of the much-missed Butter Barn, home of Fortnite's brilliant pancake song.)
With 90 seconds on the clock, the aim of the game is to collect alien orbs which boost the amount of loot you'll get upon leaving. You can also extend your time in the mothership by picking up timer orbs.

Some changes will be made permanent, though others - most notably the ability to interact with PokéStops and gyms at an increased distance - will be removed. 
But changes will be made on a country-by-country basis, Niantic has said, and in the short term there will be new temporary "exploration bonuses" for countries which lose the pandemic changes soon.

GamesIndustry.biz reports the say-on-pay vote, which had been delayed to this week in what was seen by some as an effort by Activision Blizzard to avoid an embarrassing slapdown, won approval from 54 percent of shareholders - down from the 56.8 percent approval seen last year, which itself was down from the 58 percent approval of 2019.
The decision comes following significant pressure from CtW, an investment company that "holds directors accountable for irresponsible and unethical corporate behaviour and excessive executive pay".

Speaking on his YouTube series Harada's Bar, Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada discussed the ill-fated project, which was announced 11 years ago in July 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Tekken X Street Fighter was a much-hyped crossover fighting game in development at Bandai Namco in collaboration with Street Fighter maker Capcom. It was meant to follow 2D fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken by mashing together characters from both series, this time in the 3D Tekken style.

<li>Machine learning can help defenders more accurately detect and triage potential attacks. However, in many cases these technologies are elaborations on long-standing methods &#8212; not fundamentally new approaches &#8212; that bring new attack surfaces of their own.
<li>A wide range of specific tasks could be fully or partially automated with the use of machine learning, including some forms of vulnerability discovery, deception, and attack disruption.

Well, while holding VR controllers, I guess. 
VHVR is a community-made VR mod for Valheim that was first released back in April, and did a pretty good job of translating Valehim's Viking world into VR (even if players could only move using a standard gamepad or mouse and keyboard). Here's our own Ian Higton trying it out at the time:
Work on the mod continued post-launch, and now VHVR has been given a game-changing update that adds motion control support. Thanks to the work of modder Maddy25 (who apparently almost single-handedly implemented many of the motion control systems), you can now interact with items in Valheim more directly. There's upper-body and finger tracking using VRIK, melee combat, bow and arrow controls, fishing, point and click building, and you can use your hands to interact with the environment. There are also custom VR controls for interacting with menus, along with switching and equipping items.

Operators are proving to be an excellent solution to
running stateful distributed applications in Kubernetes. Open source tools like
the Operator SDK provide ways to build reliable and maintainable
operators, making it easier to extend Kubernetes and implement custom
scheduling.
Kubernetes operators run complex software inside your cluster. The open source
community has already built many operators for distributed
applications like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, or Argo CD. Even outside of
open source, operators can help to bring new functionality to your Kubernetes
cluster.
An operator is a set of custom resources and a
set of controllers. A controller watches for changes to specific

Xbox teased the shooter was coming to Xbox Game Pass just a couple of weeks before release, and swiftly became one of the service's most high-profile Game Pass offerings. Now, a few months on, Square Enix says that despite the "slight issues" with bugs and server instability, it has "gotten off to a good start as a new IP".
"In regards to the response to Outriders, while there were slight issues with bugs and the like on launch, we believe it has gotten off to a good start as a new IP," Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda told investors at a financial briefing back in May, the English translation of which was published today (thanks, VGC).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Massive Entertainment head, David Polfeldt, is stepping down as managing director to "pursue other challenges".
Polfeldt, who was heading the Ubisoft team responsible for the upcoming Avatar game as well as leading on titles like The Division, is taking "a long break" before "embark[ing] on a new adventure in Ubisoft". Polfeldt has worked at Massive for 17 years, and served as managing director for 12 of those.
"When we signed Star Wars, and finally completed our beautiful building Eden in 2020, I felt an overwhelming sense of completion, as if I had achieved everything I once dreamt of," the director said on the Ubisoft blog (thanks, VGC).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The team behind Among Us, Innersloth, has opened up about feeling "overwhelmed" and "burnt out" after the success of their cult classic multiplayer detective game during lockdown.
"Among Us going viral, it was just like, 'OK, this is my life,'" said artist Amy Liu. "The pressure to get things done quickly was really high. September to December, we're talking to Xbox, PlayStation. They were gonna try to get Among Us on these platforms, which usually takes many months - like, half a year to a year. We were like, 'Three months! We're gonna try that.'"
"I definitely burnt out," Liu told Anthony Padilla (thanks, Kotaku). "It was tough because during all of this, we weren't able to see friends and family. Being so tired from working, I couldn't even go visit my family during covid and had to spend holidays alone... that was definitely the hardest time."

The MG 82, added to the game as a tier 15 unlock from the Season 4 battle pass on Thursday, was soon found to shred enemies extremely quickly - at a time when developer Raven wants to increase Warzone's 'time-to-kill'.
One of the other issues with the gun is it is available out in the field as ground loot. This means players have early access to an extremely strong gun, simply from looting. Sometimes you'll pick up the MG 82 with decent attachments, too.

That's what Tourism Ireland is banking on, as the organisation has teamed up with Ubisoft to use Assassin's Creed Valhalla in a promotional campaign. 
Assassin's Creed Valhalla's first expansion, Wrath of the Druids, brings Viking protagonist Eivor across the seas to embark on new adventures in Ireland. Locations such as Dublin, Benbulben, the Giant's Causeway and the Hill of Tara are all visitable in-game, and Tourism Ireland has collaborated with Ubisoft to create a comparison video showing the game versions and their real-life counterparts: 
The campaign doesn't end there, however, as streamers in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Scandinavia will help showcase Irish landscapes in Wrath of the Druids as part of the collaboration. This is the first time that Tourism Ireland has worked with gaming content creators.

The Mastery Challenge questline begins with a bang, as a meteor hits Eivor's Ravensthorpe. The impact reveals a door, apparently concealed within the cliffside all this time, and a mysterious woman, Hildiran, who's now investigating what's going on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What if you were a tiny little semi-sentient program running through a mainframe? Well, that's basically what's going on in Recompile - a Metroidvania-inspired 3D platformer that's due to release later this year. 
Recompile was originally planned for release in 2020, but as announced during Gamespot's Play for All showcase, it's now set to launch this August. Players take on the role of a computer virus that's trying to escape deletion. It's got snappy combat, generous amounts of mobility and plenty of hacking-themed puzzles - as I discovered when I tried it out at EGX Rezzed in 2019. 
Oh, also there are some pretty spectacular visual effects going on, as you can see from the latest trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone on PlayStation 4 received a surprise update this week to enable 120fps on PlayStation 5 via backwards compatibility, but it can be tricky to actually make work.
Fans soon discovered that in order to get 120fps on the battle royale, you have to turn off HDR (high-dynamic-range imaging) on the PS5.
I had a chat with Rich from Digital Foundry and he verified this is the case. Disabling HDR is the only way to get Warzone working at 120fps on PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring finally stepped out of the shadows with a proper trailer and several chunky interviews during E3 week, but one person we hadn't heard from on the subject was, of course, George R.R. Martin. The Game of Thrones author has been involved in some of the writing for Elden Ring, and now we've finally heard a little more about his contributions from the man himself. 
Martin recently visited Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism (where he studied in the '70s) to receive an honorary doctorate, and during the visit spoke to local news station WWTW about his career... including Elden Ring. He didn't exactly provide any shocking revelations, but confirmed he'd mainly been involved in the early stages of development and creating the game's fantasy world. 
"The game is called the Elden Ring and it's a sequel to a video game that came out a few years ago called Dark Souls," Martin said. "My work on it was actually done years ago. These games, they're like movies, they take a long time to develop.

Bowser's Airship is one of the largest Super Mario sets we've seen so far. Clocking in at over 14 inches, this 1152-piece addition provides one of the best-looking builds of the entire range.
There's no official launch date yet, and Amazon's product listing page has now been deleted. Still, we'd expect it to arrive in August alongside the upcoming Super Luigi Starter Kit and the third wave of blind bag add-ons announced officially earlier this week.

Season 4 added a new armored cargo truck to the game - itself a controversial addition due to how strong the vehicle is, particularly in solo battle royale. But it got a lot worse when it soon emerged the truck could be used to turn invisible.
To be fair to developer Raven, it moved quickly to pull the truck from the game, thus eradicating the invisibility glitch.

Developer Asobo is promising pilots the chance to explore "vast fjords, riveting urban vistas, domineering peaks, and centuries-old iconic castles" in its new Nordic countries update, which also brings landscape enhancements, improved regional architecture, five new airports, improved data for 100 airports, and over 78 new points of interest.
Once the World Update is downloaded (first update the sim, then grab the World Update from the in-game Marketplace) players will also have the opportunity to tackle five new bush trips - one for each of the new Nordic countries - plus five new landing challenges, focussed on Denmark's Bornholm, Iceland's Ísafjörður, Sweden's Stockholm Arlanda, Norway's Svalbard, and Finland's Vaasa Airports.

The relaunch was announced during Xbox's E3 follow-up showcase this evening, and the Xbox Design Lab website is now up and running. The customisation program allows you to pick colours for most external parts of the controller, including the "body, back case, D-pad, bumpers, triggers, thumbsticks, ABXY, View, Menu and Share buttons." The Xbox Wire blog post says there are 18 colours to choose from, including the colours of existing Xbox Series X/S controllers like Shock Blue and Pulse Red.   
If you want to make it extra personal, you can also get your controller engraved with a Gamertag or custom message of up to 16 characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves' next major free update is packing in one hell of a crossover, bringing the world of Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean into Rare's swashbuckling multiplayer adventure. And if the arrival of Captain Jack Sparrow wasn't enough to be excited about, it's also finally giving the formidable kraken a face - which makes an appearance in a brand-new trailer.
The centrepiece of Sea of Thieves' Pirates of the Caribbean crossover - officially known as A Pirate's Life - takes the form of a brand-new cinematic story campaign. It features five new Tall Tales episodes (the first since March 2020's Heart of Flame), charting Jack Sparrow's arrival in the Sea of Thieves and the events that ensue.
There are tantalising snatches of those adventures in Rare's second crossover trailer below, including the appearance of Davy Jones and his formidable vessel the Flying Dutchman, battles against gargantuan mermaid statues, and even a portable talking skull that should stir fond memories for Monkey Island aficionados.

The video, below, does not include any gameplay or any new footage of the game save some hard to make out snippets. It begins instead with a message from Ninja Theory chief Tameem Antoniades, who discusses the work that's being done to make Hellblade 2 at the Microsoft-owned studio's new digs in Cambridge. The video then goes on to present a rather disturbing montage that sets the scene.
I get the impression Hellblade 2 is still a long way off. In the video, Antoniades says Ninja Theory is currently building "a good chunky slice of the game before we then move into full production to build out the rest".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were wondering just how popular PUBG is on mobile, the answer is: very, as 17 million people have now signed up for upcoming mobile title PUBG: New State. 
PUBG: New State was announced back in February and described as the "only mobile successor to the original PC version of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds". It's a futuristic version of PUBG set after the events of the original game, in the year 2051. It's supposed to have "ultra-realistic graphics" that will surpass "what was previously possible in mobile gaming graphics", along with some new game mechanics like dodging, drone calls and support requests. 
Pre-registration was opened up following the game's announcement, with players able to register their interest via Google Play and the App Store. And it seems to have received a lot of attention, judging by the numbers announced by PUBG Corp today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, another Cyberpunk 2077 patch has arrived, and although this one doesn't bring any spectacular gameplay additions it does promise further bug fixes and stability improvements.
Patch 1.23 is now live on all platforms, and sorts out a number of quest-specific bugs and general performance issues. The patch itself is apparently rather chunky, with console users reporting a download size of 30GB (my Steam download was a rather more modest 3.45GB).  
Of note is the paragraph on stability and performance, which says the patch will provide "numerous crash fixes in animations, UI, scene, physics and gameplay systems". The patch also promises a reduction in the number of crashes through "memory optimisations and memory management improvements in various systems". There's also a vague mention of "various console CPU optimisations".

Facebook initially started testing adverts on the Oculus mobile app last month, but it's now taking things a step further by trialling adverts inside the Oculus Quest VR headset. The adverts are first being tested in a game called Blaston by Resolution Games, and will roll out to a couple of other apps "over the coming weeks". 
Judging by a gif on the Oculus blog showing an in-headset advert, it looks like players can point at an advert to click on a link or save it for later. There's also a drop-down menu to report and hide ads, and an option to tweak user preferences.

In a thread on Twitter about Link's appendage, freelance writer and Eurogamer contributor

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While there was plenty to get excited about in Nintendo's busy E3 showcase, one notable absence came in the form of No More Heroes 3 - the latest entry in developer Grasshopper Manufacture's cult-classic action-adventure series - which is coming to Switch in just a few short months. However, Nintendo has now made up for that no-show, sharing 20 minutes of new gameplay in a special Nintendo Treehouse livestream.
Announced back in 2019, No More Heroes 3 - which is set nine years after the events of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle and two years after Travis Strikes Again - once again casts players as otaku and sometime-assassin Travis Touchdown. However, while previous games saw Travis murdering his way to the top of the United Assassins Association league, this third series entry ushers in a new threat, with players now charged with eliminating extraterrestrial enemies in order to reach number one in the Galactic Superhero Rankings.
As seen in Nintendo's new "early look" at No More Heroes 3, the series' wonderfully satisfying hack-and-slash action - built around Travis' lightsaber-like Beam Katana - makes a return, with no obvious surprises where core mechanics are concerned. Players will again need to combine the likes of basic moves, heavy moves, kicks, blocks, and rolls to defeat enemies (motion controls are optional) with the likes of finishers and jackpot bonuses also returning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You've thought it, I've thought it, but the question of what London would look like in the Fallout universe has never truly been answered... until now. 
A Fallout mod team is working on a huge project called Fallout: London, which is described as a "DLC-sized mod for Bethesda's Fallout 4". Although the team has been issuing updates on progress for some time, yesterday the group released a full reveal trailer, and the work done so far looks extremely impressive. Many of London's most iconic landmarks have been given a Fallout makeover - including Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, St. Paul's Cathedral and even the BT Tower. Oh, and there's some extremely hammy commentary over the whole thing. 
There are some really nice touches throughout the trailer: you can spot plenty of London buses, murky tube stations and even a classic London pub. I'm also a big fan of the Beefeater who's embraced a more Raider-inspired look. It feels like there are some nods to Britain's involvement in WWI and WWII, with barrage balloons seen in the sky and soldiers camping out in trenches.

Microsoft confirmed it will use Xbox Cloud Gaming to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator, for example, to Xbox One.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Koei Tecmo is resurrecting its celebrated picture-snapping survival horror series, Project Zero, bringing its most recent instalment - Wii U's Maiden of Black Water - to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC later this year.
Released back in 2015, Maiden of Black Water is the fifth main entry in the Project Zero series (known as Fatal Frame in the US) and once again arms players with a magic camera - used to battle spirits by taking their picture, which is considerably more unnerving than it sounds.
Unfortunately, while Project Zero's first three entries are brilliant (and genuinely terrifying) survival horror offerings, Maiden of Black Water - set on the fictional Mount Hikami, known for its suicides and ghostly goings-on - is a bit of a dud.

The game was announced as part of today's Nintendo E3 Direct, and promises a whirlwind ride through some classic Mario Party games. It's somewhere between a new Mario Party title and remake, essentially mixing elements of previous games into a new collection. This includes five classic Mario Party boards from the N64 era, with boards such as Peach's Birthday Cake and Space Land making a reappearance. 
Mario Party Superstars also promises a bunch of minigames from the series' catalogue - 100 in total, in fact - along with the usual mix of zany board events. All the minigames support button controls.

The ability to visit floating islands is reminiscent of Skyward Sword, the Wii Zelda entry which is getting a re-release this summer. This time, the islands look larger, and Link will be able to glide through the sky between them.

Although obviously not quite as happy as if it had been a brand-new game.
Advance Wars 1+2: Re-boot Camp is coming to Switch later this year on 3rd December.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WarioWare is back, with WarioWare: Get it Together hitting Switch on the 10th of September.
The announcement was part of Nintendo's E3 Direct. The gimmick? Get It Together sees players controlling the WarioWare characters inside the mini-games. So we see Wario squeezing toothpaste out of a giant tube and peeling off a facemask and dodging bird poo, for example. Elsewhere, other WarioWare characters have new talents - 9Volt uses a yo-yo to turn the blades of a windmill in one game - and different characters will be able to use their own specific abilities to complete each challenge.
This idea comes into its own in a new two-player mode which sees players competing or collaborating on a single screen. The micro-games shown throughout the reveal were very classical Wario type experiences, with a lovely swipe-file mix of styles and production values. I can't wait.

Footage revealed during today's E3 Direct showed Samus being chased by a robot through various side-scrolling 2D environments. (Of course, both Samus and the robot, EMMI, are also being turned into new amiibo.)

The announcement video includes a cutscene showing Kazuya chucking existing Smash characters off a cliff - that's a reference to the famous Tekken cutscene in which Kazuya's dad, Heihachi, chucks Kazuya off a cliff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, we've already had shows and big game announcements as part of this year's all-online E3 week, but how about actually playing some upcoming games? If you've got an Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S, you're in luck. 
ID@Xbox's Summer Game Fest demo event kicks off today, and we now have the full list of 40 game demos available for players to try. Gorgeous sci-fi adventure Sable is in the mix (which I'd thoroughly recommend trying out based on my own hands-on time with the game). There's also Tunic, a Zelda-like game with a fox as the main protagonist. 
Elsewhere on the list, you can also find Black Book - a dark RPG adventure based on slavic myths in which you play as a young sorceress and fight in card-based battles. Arietta of Spirits is a retro-inspired adventure telling an emotional story of a girl and her family who visit her grandmother's cabin for the first time since she passed away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, it looks like the front of Xbox game cases are getting a very slight refresh, as box art images spotted on BestBuy appear to show a newly re-designed version of the standard Xbox Series X game case. 
As you can see from these Halo Infinite and Flight Simulator listings, more of the box is taken up with game art rather than additional Xbox logos at the top, and the console banner has become a little shorter and wider. The banner has also changed colour from black to white - as if someone's flipped a switch to put it in light mode. 
Social media account Xbox News also managed to spot a version for Forza Horizon 5, which you can see below. It's worth noting that the big "optimised for Series X" badge was removed from cases last year following negative feedback from fans.

Everwild, alongside various other far-off Microsoft exclusives, was absent from this year's Bethesda-dominated Xbox E3 showcase. That is because its development has undergone a reboot, and its launch window pushed back, according to a VGC report.
But while we won't see Everwild for some time, there's reason to be optimistic for the project. Rare veteran Gregg Mayles, who has served at the studio for more than 30 years, was recently brought on as its creative director.

The images in question, shared by freelance journalist Nils Ahrensmeier on Twitter earlier today, purportedly show PlayStation 5 and Switch box art for Banana Mania, alongside four typically cheery screenshots from the game.
One of these shots teases a return for Monkey Ball's much-loved party game Monkey Target, while the others are a little harder to pin down. However, a few well-versed Monkey Ball fans are currently doing some deductive work and speculating that the images could well be pointing to a remake of 2005's Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, which melded the first two Monkey Ball games along with brand-new content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Okomotive has revealed Far: Changing Tides, the follow-up to its acclaimed post-apocalyptic vehicle adventure Far: Lone Sails, which is out on PC and consoles later this year.
Changing Tides sends players on a fresh bout of genteel side-scrolling vehicular management. This time, however, instead of embarking on a tank-y trundle across a dried-out ocean, they'll be following the horizon for some boat-based adventure above and beneath the waves.
"Set sail and discover the wonders of a flooded world filled with mystery," explains Okomotive. "Traverse the ruins of a once great society and use the pieces from its past to build a brighter future. Dive into unknown depths on the hunt for precious fuel and salvage, devise innovative solutions to overcome intricate obstacles, and unearth forgotten relics lost to time."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yesterday's release date reveal for Flight Simulator on Xbox Series X/S, Microsoft has shared a few additional details - including confirmation that it'll run at 30fps on console - via the time-honoured mediums of FAQ and Twitter.
Those frame rate details come via the official Microsoft Flight Simulator Twitter feed, which, in response to queries from a number of curious punters, confirmed that Xbox Series X/S players can expect a base frame rate of 30fps. It noted, however, that frame rates above 30fps are possible on TVs supporting variable refresh rates (VRR).
Over on the official Flight Simulator's FAQ, meanwhile, most additional details provided aim to clarify questions around how the console edition will interact with the version already released on PC, and confirm, for instance, that those who own the Windows Store version on PC won't need to purchase the console edition again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, we finally got a proper look at Elden Ring during Summer Games Fest last week, and all of a sudden we now have a flood of information about what to expect in the upcoming game. In an interview with IGN, legendary director Hidetaka Miyazaki gave plenty of information on the background lore, along with some discussion of abilities, multiplayer and the game's structure.
One of the first topics discussed was Elden Ring's setting, The Lands Between, which has been deliberately designed to give "an enormous sense of scale and this broadness and openness". It's split into six major areas, each of which is the domain of a demigod. These are lined up to suggest a specific order in which to tackle them, but the player can make their own decisions about which to do first. "You won't be able to access everything from the start, but there are a lot of different ways you can approach each area," Miyazaki explained. "And there's a lot of freedom as to which order you tackle different areas as well."
Players will be able to access a hub area a little later in the game, which you can "branch out from", and also the six main areas of The Lands Between. "These will be the domains or the areas of the main demigod bosses," Miyazaki explained. "From here, you're able to explore not only these mainline dungeon areas, but also a wide variety of catacombs, castles, and fortresses, which are interspersed throughout the map. These have a range of scale and scope, but the main dungeons are these six - these are the ones that you're going to be heading to on your adventures throughout the main world. "

As with previous waves, there are 10 additional enemies and items to collect, and you'll need a bit of luck to obtain the full set with no duplicates. (Or to swap with a friend. Or eBay.)
There's no release date or price yet for Series 3, but we'd expect these to cost the same as the last two waves (£3.49/$4.99/€3.99 each) and arrive alongside the upcoming Super Luigi Starter Course on 1st August.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember that brightly-coloured alien exploration game In Other Waters? Well, the developer is back with another sci-fi offering, although this time it's all taking place on a run-down space station. 
Titled Citizen Sleeper, the game was previously teased under the name Project Sidereal, but developer Jump Over The Age revealed the new name and trailer during last night's PC Gaming Show. It's described as "roleplaying in the ruins of interplanetary capitalism," with the player taking the role of a "sleeper" - in other words, a digitised human consciousness. The bad news is that you're also owned by a huge corporation that wants you back, and your body will deteriorate as part of "planned obsolescence" for escapees. This what happens when billionaires start jetting themselves into space, I guess. 
"Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle," the Steam description explains. "Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somerville has been teased with a number of trailers over the past few years, but during yesterday's Xbox-Bethesda showcase we got another look at the game - and now have some idea of what the main characters will look like.  
The sci-fi adventure is being made by Jumpship, an independent studio founded by animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Playdead co-founder and former CEO Dino Patti. (Playdead created Limbo and its spiritual successor Inside, two very unsettling puzzle-platformers.) 
As you can see from the trailer, Somerville set in a sci-fi world and focuses on the struggles of a family trying to survive a major disaster. "In the wake of catastrophe you must find the means to make your family whole again," says the official description. "Somerville is a sci-fi adventure grounded in the intimate repercussions of large-scale conflict.

Microsoft is really going to release this dinky desk-sized refrigerator later this year. Like Halo Infinite, it has a vague "holiday 2021" launch date. 
If you stuck around after Microsoft's big Xbox and Bethesda Showcase event yesterday, you'll have seen the following trailer pop up, showing off how it'll look:

This dinky puzzle platformer has you controlling a miniature alien astronaut as he explores our world. He's aided in his travels by a swarm of mini creatures, named tinykin. 
Sound familiar? While clearly inspired by Nintendo's Pikmin, what impressed me here was how snappy and fluid the movement and exploration looks, with tinykin used to create ladders or skate around.

But perhaps it plays better? It's impossible to say right now, as the game's instantly-dropped PlayStation 5 demo remains broken, and unable to play.
Curious Final Fantasy fans first reported an inability to load the demo after downloading it last night. This morning, our Aoife told me it's still not working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in May, rumours began circulating that Square Enix was collaborating with Nioh developer Team Ninja on an action-focussed Final Fantasy spin-off titled Final Fantasy Origin. Well, it turns out those rumours weren't far off at all! Square has now officially unveiled Team Ninja's action-RPG Final Fantasy spin-off, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins.
Stranger of Paradise follows a band of adventurers who, as the trailer repeatedly reminds us, want to kill chaos. Or at least stab it in the face a few times until its head pops off. "Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine," Square elaborates in its announcement, "Yet doubts remain-are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?".
May's rumours suggested the game would slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja's Nioh games and From Software's Souls series, albeit with a more accessible focus, and today's reveal appears to support that. Square is promising "exhilarating, action-packed battles" against iconic Final Fantasy monsters in a "world of dark fantasy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platinum Games' long-awaited Square Enix title Babylon's Fall is now coming to PS5 as well as PS4 and PC. This was announced during Square Enix's E3 showcase this evening.
The game's also going live-service. The publisher treated audiences to a fairly brief trailer, featuring in-game footage of a frantic 3D action game with lots of armour and magical lightning and some decent operatic music. A follow-up developer interview revealed a game in which teams of players enjoy hack-and-slash combat and explore dungeons in groups of four. These dungeons are located on different floors of a giant tower, and end with a boss.
Regular updates will allow for new moves that can be equipped as skills. There's a focus on character customisation and crafting, and a massive emphasis on builds, due to a "Gideon coffin" the characters wear that allows them to equip two additional weapons alongside the weapons they hold in their hands, and, I think, swing them about independently, a la Astral Chain. The game will ship with five weapon types, and there will be a website that allows players to tweak their builds while they're away from the game.

While we don't yet know exactly what the gameplay will look like, it will feature co-op with up to four players. "Redfall blends single and multiplayer options seamlessly, allowing the player to venture into the darkness alone or to squad-up with up to three friends for four-player co-op", a Bethesda press release explained. "Teammates can try different hero loadouts and combine their strengths to overcome the vampire legion and their brood of maniacal followers."

Microsoft Flight Simulator received much praise when it launched on PC at the end of last year, in large part thanks to its utterly staggering rendition of the entire world - one that Asobo has continued to build on with regular free sim updates and visual overhauls for the likes of Japan, the United States, France, Benelux, the UK, and Ireland.
"From light planes to wide-body jets," explains Microsoft of its flight sim, "you'll test your piloting skills against the challenges of real-time weather, including accurate worldwide cloud cover and cloud layers, wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, rain, and lightning - all in a dynamic and living world. With the power of satellite data and cloud-based AI, you'll travel the entire planet in amazing detail with over 37,000 airports, 2 million cities, 1.5 billion buildings, real mountain ranges, roads, trees, rivers, animals, traffic, and more."

There was also plenty of siege and town-based action, and lots of people in armour running at each other on nice grassy hills, which is exactly what we want.

The third-person platformer has seen a series of delays, with developer Double Fine previously explaining that it needed more time to bring it up to standard, and that the studio needed time to adjust to its acquisition by Microsoft. It looks like we'll finally see the results of all this hard work soon, however, and Double Fine provided a fresh peek at Psychonauts 2 with a gameplay trailer shown during the showcase livestream:  
"Psychonauts 2 is an exciting journey through the mind filled with the signature Double Fine humor and heart, and a touch of next-level platforming," says the official blog post. "You play as Razputin Aquato, a trained acrobat and powerful young psychic, who has realized his lifelong dream of joining the international psychic espionage organization known as the Psychonauts. But these psychic super spies are in trouble. Raz must use his powers to bring the murderous psychic villain, Maligula, back from the dead! Check out the video above and get psyched!"

It's all in-game captured footage from an Xbox Series X, showing off the chaos of the game's new 128-person battles and a range of new toys.
The highlights include a tank being air-dropped into battle via parachute, a grappling hook that should open up some new opportunities for the more ingenuitive campers (and anti-campers), some cross-skyscraper ziplines, a desert cyclone, and a rocket launching into the atmosphere. There's a nice tone to it all, too - clearly DICE is aware of the more ridiculous stunts the Battlefield community has become known for pulling off.

Davy Jones, inevitably, isn't far behind, and the adventure will see players setting sail to visit new locations from both universes - including some from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park rides that didn't quite make it into the movies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five Nights at Freddy's creator Scott Cawthon has said he "won't apologise for" funding US Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, but acknowledged that "with so many people from the LGBT community in the fanbase that I love", it was "not an option" to ignore fan backlash about his political beliefs.
While many of the candidates Cawthon backed are conservative and sit within America's right-leaning Republican party, Cawthon insists that "for those who took the time to look", they'd see that the candidates he supported "included men, women, white people, black people, republicans, and democrats". 
Directly addressing his community on Reddit, Cawthon also took the time to discuss why he supports Republicans despite their broadly anti-LGBTQIA+ stance, stating "even if there were candidates who had better things to say to the LGBT community directly, and bigger promises to make, I believed that their stances on other issues would have ended up doing much greater harm to those communities than good".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Town of Light developer LKA has dropped a new video teaser for its upcoming psychological thriller, Martha Is Dead.
The trailer doesn't give away much, but it does touch upon the Tale of the White Lady, "the spirit of a murdered, tortured soul whose one goal is to seek a moment's relief by dragging others into the water to suffer the same fate".
The "savage story" told in the video is reportedly based upon a real-life Italian legend, which is purportedly passed down through from generation to generation much as it's done in this trailer, with the young Giulia badgering her grandmother to tell her the spooky story of "a drowned maiden, murdered in a fit of jealousy by her lover who now stalks the shores of the lake where she suffered in her final moments".

It is perhaps surprising to see the visually-impressive role-player getting ported to last-gen - not that we saw much of what that PS4 version might look like today. But this move will, obviously, open up the game to a wider audience.
Today also brought word of Fire & Darkness, a new expansion for Godfall which adds in a new realm, new story, and a hoard of new loot.

There was some eye-catching stuff shown during the show, which was one big piss-take of subscriptions, games as a service and video game monetisation. The video of the entire "Devolver MaxPass+ Showcase | Monetization as a Service" is below, and below that are trailers for all the games.
Let's start with Trek to Yomi, a "cinematic tour-de-force" inspired by classic samurai films from director Leonard Menchiari and Flying Wild Hog, the Polish studio behind the 2013 reboot of Shadow Warrior and its 2016 sequel, Shadow Warrior 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to 2017, and you might recall Ubisoft announcing it was working on a new video game adaptation of James Cameron's Avatar movie. Five years of almost complete silence around the project followed, but all that's now changed, with Ubisoft showing the first footage of its Avatar game, now titled Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, during its E3 livestream.
"In this new, standalone story," explains Ubisoft, "play as a Na'vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by unique creatures and new characters, and push back the formidable RDA forces that threaten it."
Ubisoft is calling Frontiers of Pandora a first-person action-adventure and a "immersive, open world experience", and its trailer - running on the latest version of Ubisoft's Snowdrop Engine, according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot - offers a jaunt through a gorgeous rendition of the planet Pandora, complete with all the exotic flora and fauna you could possible hope for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humankind, Amplitude's upcoming, history-spanning 4X game, gets a new closed beta soon, and it'll let you play through five of the game's six eras. There's also a snazzy new trailer to come with the announcement, which you can watch here:
Amplitude's done plenty of other betas like this in the past - which the studio refers to as OpenDevs - but this is the furthest into a game of Humankind you'll have been able to get, by some way.
You can play either 200 turns or up to the end of the Industrial Era, whichever comes first. Industrial era features include resources like coal and oil, railways, and artillery and air battles - we actually had a chance to explore some more of this ourselves during our latest preview but barely got halfway there, despite playing a good 10 to 15-odd hours, which should give you an idea of just how long you get with this beta.

This is the first time any game in the Assassin's Creed series has received this level of post-launch support, but this news isn't surprising. Firstly, Valhalla has gone down very well. Secondly, as we reported last month, datamining has pointed to the mythical realm of Muspelheim coming down the line. And, indeed, Ubisoft teased Muspelheim tonight.
Before all that, Valhalla has its previously-announced Siege of Paris expansion coming this summer. No release date for that was shared, but we got a good look at footage. Ubisoft also confirmed the fan-favourite "black box" missions from the series' past will return here. These are assassination target opportunities where you have a set location and multiple methods to take down a target.

Redditor JohnTLH spotted the news in the YouTube description for the upcoming Back 4 Blood PvP video reveal, which is set for 10pm UK time on Sunday 13th June.
That reveal follows Microsoft's E3 press conference, which kicks off at 6pm the same day. I suspect the announcement will be made - officially! - during Microsoft's press conference.

Speaking in the latest Axios Gaming newsletter, Ryan was asked about a 2017 interview with Time in which he recalled seeing different versions of Gran Turismo running side-by-side on PSone, PS2, PS3 and PS4.
"The PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?" he said at the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been almost a year and a half since our coins were well and truly tossed by Netflix's inaugural season of The Witcher, so anticipation is understandably high for news on Season Two. As part of its Geeked Week of reveals, Netflix teased a first look at things to come, and it's delivered exactly that - albeit limiting itself to just 12 seconds of footage.
Even before the conclusion of The Witcher's well-received first season, Netflix confirmed an eventual return for Geralt, Jennefer, Ciri, and Jaskier (as played by Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, Freya Allan, and Joey Batey respectively).
Since then, we've learned that the second season - which promises to dial back on the time-hopping antics of its predecessor - will usher in new cast members including Simon Callow as the Dorian detective Codringher, Silent Witness' Liz Carr as business partner Fenn, Bridgerton's Adjoa Andoh as priestess Nenneke, and Brave New World's Cassie Clare as Phillippa Eilhart, sorceress and advisor to King Vizimir.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's animated adaptation of legendary video game series Castlevania is now at the end of its acclaimed four-season run, and fans have been wondering what comes next. Today brings answer: more Castlevania, but different.
Castlevania's future on Netflix was left in doubt when the streaming service opted to wind up the series in its current guise after showrunner Warren Ellis departed from the show following allegations of sexual misconduct. However, subsequent rumours suggested a spin-off was in the works, and Netflix has now made that official.
With Castlevania's current run now concluded, Netflix is working on a brand-new series that will take Richter Belmont (son of original series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - both familiar characters to game fans - to 1792 France for an adventure that unfolds against the backdrop of the French Revolution.

A Splinter Cell animated adaptation was first rumoured last July, but Ubisoft and Netflix have now made the show official. It'll follows the adventures of iconic video game series protagonist Sam Fisher after he's recruited to work for the NSA's mysterious Echelon Division.
Expect black ops missions, stealth, and military tactics in a series that's being written by John Wick scribe Derek Kolstad. That's pretty much all Netflix has shared right now, other than this appropriately shadowy glimpse of Sam as he'll appear in the show:

It promises to be a busy one - debuting footage from the likes of The Witcher Season 2 and Cuphead - but first there are the opening three minutes of the streaming service's CGI Resident Evil series ahead of its release in July. 
Known as Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, this animated adaption takes place several years after the events of Resident Evil 4, with Leon S. Kennedy once again serving as the US president's bodyguard - which would probably seem like a walk in the park compared to his usual adventures if it wasn't for the threat of an imminent zombie outbreak.
Claire Redfield also plays a role in Leon's latest adventure, embarking on her own investigation as (the supposedly canon) events unfold, and if you're curious to see how proceedings kick off, you can do that via the first three minutes of the show below.

Last Stop is described as a game about "secret lives, the ties that bind, and how magic can be found in the mundane", and follows the interweaving, supernaturally tinged tales of three separate characters in modern day London.
There's Donna, a "spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life"; John, an "overworked middle-aged single dad" who's "burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent"; plus Meera, a "ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work."

Axiom Verge 2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midway through this evening's Summer Game Fest, CD Projekt released a statement discussing the circulation of stolen data from a ransomware attack - and the company is concerned it may contain employee and contractor data.
Earlier this year CD Projekt announced it had been hit by a ransomware attack, and last week we began to hear reports this stolen data was being actively shared online. Several developer-made bug montages emerged from this, but source code for several CD Projekt games (including The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077) is also reported to have been shared, and CD Projekt is concerned employee and contractor data is caught up in this.
"... We have learned new information regarding the breach, and now have reason to believe that internal data illegally obtained during the attack is currently being circulated on the internet," the statement says. "We are not able to confirm the exact contents of the data in question, though we believe it may include current/former employee and contractor details in addition to data related to our games. Furthermore, we cannot confirm whether or not the data involved may have been manipulated or tampered with following the breach."

Only a handful of the titles have been revealed so far. Thankfully, one of them is Sable, the gorgeous-looking desert sci-fi game which we'll have a write-up on very soon. Another is Tunic, the adorably cute, Zelda-like adventure game. Both of these were glimpsed in the Summer Games Fest broadcast this evening.
The other games on the list are The Riftbreaker, which I've tried on PC (and really liked), and Echo Generation and Lake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sky: Children of the Light, the acclaimed "social adventure" from Journey and Flower developer ThatGameCompany, will be making its way to Switch on 29th June.
Sky, which debuted on iOS in 2019 before heading to Android, unfolds across the seven realms of a beautiful kingdom of billowing clouds, which players can explore as their whims take them.
There are puzzley-platformy elements alongside delicate story vignettes, and it's all build around a gently collaborative multiplayer aspect, where co-operation is integral to progression, designed to encourage "compassion, friendship, and altruism".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One indie game which caught my eye during tonight's Summer Game Fest stream was Planet of Lana, a beautiful side-scrolling platformer coming in 2022. 
It's the work of new outfit Wishfully, and has a Limbo-esque vibe to it. While more colourful, there's definitely something eerie about watching Planet of Lana's protagonist and her little friend see rockets falling from the sky.
"Planet of Lana is a cinematic puzzle adventure framed by an epic sci-fi saga that stretches across centuries and galaxies," Wishfully describes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Bombay, the studio formed by Left 4 Dead and Portal writer Chet Faliszek, and Riot Games designer Kimberley Voll, has revealed its new game The Anacrusis.
It's - like Left 4 Dead - a co-operative shooter for four people, and it takes place on an abandoned starship on the edge of explored space. There you'll fight seemingly endless hordes of aliens in an "infinitely replayable fight", according to Summer Games Fest host Geoff Keighley, who announced the game. You'll unlock perks and weapons and "new ways to play you can share with your team", said Keighley.
Despite the theme, Anacrusis looks like a very bright and upbeat game. It's not dissimilar to the Portal series, actually, with brightly lit, clean sci-fi scenery, and some arty splashes of turquoise and orangey-red here and there. Very pleasant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems there's a whole lot of content on the horizon for social deduction game Among Us, as developer InnerSloth has detailed its upcoming plans for 2021 - and it's looking like a busy schedule. 
The big news revealed during Summer Game Fest is that a new mode is on the way, called Hide and Seek. It seems seekers will be given a very small radius in which they can see other players, leaving it up to those hiding to out-manoeuvre their pursuers. 
And that's not the only major gameplay change - after modders started doing it themselves, some new roles are officially being added to the mix, including Sheriff and Scientist roles. As of yet there's no details on how these work (even on the roadmap explainer page), so I imagine this will be explained at a later date.

Salt and Sacrifice, much like its predecessor, sports side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat. This time, however, players, in the role of a Marked Inquisitor, can choose from one of eight classes - Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage - as they battle their way through the world of Alterstone Kingdom.
"Track down over 20 types of Mages in abandoned villages, dungeons, tomb-temples, and more," explains Ska in its announcement. "Ransack their remains to forge new weapons and armour with Runic Arts and become even stronger for the battles ahead."

The game was first announced back at E3 2018, but a series of delays saw its release date pushed back to 2021. Players take on the role of Sable, and embark on a rite of passage that sees her leave her tribe to explore the world on her hoverbike. It's got a gorgeous art style that's inspired by French artist Mobieus, and a sci-fi open world that feels very reminiscent of some of the wrecks seen in Star Wars. Oh, and it's set to launch on PC and Xbox. 
Sable is being developed by a small team in the UK called Shedworks, who - you guessed it - work out of a garden shed. I visited Shedworks back in 2018 to learn about Sable's story - and also check out the shed for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, developer Iron Gate released a pretty ambitious roadmap for Valheim that included several major updates and a host of smaller improvements: but as the months passed, it began to seem less and less likely that Iron Gate would meet all these targets. Sure enough, the Iron Gate team has confirmed that it's had to revise its roadmap for 2021 - and that includes a trimmed-down version of its update schedule. 
"As we're sure lots of you suspected, we won't be able to deliver four updates this year," Iron Gate explained in an update post on Steam. "Instead, we're now planning to launch Hearth and Home in Q3 2021, and we're temporarily taking down the roadmap whilst we make some changes. We are sorry it's taken us so long to update you."
Iron Gate went on to explain that it hadn't been prepared for "such a large influx of players", and the game's popularity highlighted plenty of bugs that needed urgent fixes. "Our priority has been to make the current experience as stable as possible and this has meant new content has taken a backseat. To put it clearly; we haven't been able to focus all of our resources on Hearth and Home until May.

Speaking at part of a pre-E3, "What's Next for Gaming" virtual briefing shown to press this week, Spencer took aim at Sony's strategy of releasing its PlayStation-exclusives on PC years after they come out on console.

Liz Hamren, CVP of Gaming Experiences & Platforms, said Microsoft was already working on new hardware, "some of which won't come to light for years."
"Cloud is key to our hardware and Game Pass roadmaps, but no one should think we're slowing down on our core console engineering. In fact, we're accelerating it," Hamren said in a video briefing shown to press this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG's bots have never been particularly popular with the community ever since they were introduced to public matchmaking, but a recent update transformed the bumbling bots into something far worse: horrifyingly accurate aimbots. 
Patch 12.1 brought with it some changes to bot AI, which were - in theory - supposed to improve their behaviour, but it seems PUBG Corp made them a little too good. Players took to Reddit to document these machines of terror, pointing out that they were behaving like cheaters. Those who spectated the bots or replayed death cams discovered they effectively had wall hacks and aimbot enabled, with the bots spinning around to obliterate players with unnerving speed and accuracy. 
"They're 'aim bots' now and that's no joke," said appropriately-named Reddit user Morbidly Tortured. "I got taken out by a bot from 200 meters out. It auto locked on to me and hit every shot. I almost reported it until I spectated for about three minutes and noticed it was a bot with how it was running, stopping, going prone."

The PC version of this action game collection is bare bones, with severely limited customisation and graphics options.
It does not support mouse and keyboard, forcing PC users to play with a controller. A controller is perhaps preferable for Ninja Gaiden, but to not provide the option of mouse and keyboard is shocking.

Game director Aaron Keller announced the feature during Blizzard's latest developer update, working through some of the special matchmaking rules that'll be introduced once cross-play arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
Essentially, while parties of console-only players will continue to be placed with other consoles players during matchmaking, and those on PC will continue to be placed with other PC players, mixed teams will be placed in the PC matchmaking pool. The one exception to this is Competitive Play mode, which will not permit mixed groups at all.

The current 1984 version of Verdansk map launched in April - half a year after Treyarch's Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War came out.

With the vaccine rollout now in progress, it seems some companies are making plans for what their workplace structure will look like in the future - and that includes Ubisoft. 
Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier earlier this week tweeted that Ubisoft had emailed employees about a new "hybrid" work structure, and Ubisoft has now published this email on its official website.
"In summary the future will be hybrid, offering the majority of Ubisoft team members the opportunity to balance home and office work," the post explains. "This has been designed based on our learnings from the past year and from your feedback; this 'test and learn' approach is one we will continue to adopt moving forward."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a string of rumours, whispers and leaks EA has finally lifted the veil of the latest Battlefield, seeing the flagship first-person shooter moving away from the historical setting of recent entries to a near-future backdrop - with this year's model subsequently called Battlefield 2042. In a break from other recent traditions, it'll also do away with a single-player campaign, and there are no plans for an accompanying battle royale mode.
Battlefield 2042 will instead focus on its multiplayer offering, supporting 128 players on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game support 64 players. There will also be the option of playing against AI bots, either solo or with a squad of friends. 
"I think that's just something that enables us to really lean into what we are best at," Battlefield 2042 design director Daniel Berlin told Eurogamer about the lack of a single-player campaign - something that's been a series mainstay since Battlefield 3. "If you look at the DNA of the studio, what we've been doing for so long, we just said you know what, we're not going to have a traditional single-player campaign this time around, but we're going to put all that emphasis and all those resources into building depth into the multiplayer. Because that is what we do best."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has released an update for the PlayStation 5 and the DualSense controller.
The update, which brings the PS5 up to version 21.01-03.20.00 (just rolls off the tongue!) makes a short list of changes, as detailed on the PlayStation website:
Of note is the update to the DualSense controller. Sony said it improves stability, which isn't particularly helpful. Redditor Heymodspleasehelp noticed a controller battery indicator bug was now fixed. "It was at zero percent before I updated now it's at two bars," they said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's laid back Team Rumble mode has been quietly revamped as part of the game's new extraterrestrial season - and fans aren't best pleased with the changes. 
Tweaks to Team Rumble's relaxed formula had felt overdue, as things had begun to feel a little too relaxed in recent months and it had become common for matches to peter out towards the end. 
But Epic's unexplained changes - apparently designed to speed up the mode's pacing and match length - have gone overboard, fans say, and ruin the ability to use Team Rumble to check off in-game challenges.

Instead, it would recognize that the status quo was less stable than it seemed, and a major source of the tensions that have started to unravel it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just in time for the launch of Marvel's new Disney+ show Loki, the Disney+ 30-day trial has returned to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving members a free month of access to the streaming service. 
As explained on Xbox Wire, the free trial can be claimed through Xbox Game Pass Perks, and can be activated any time from now until 30th September. If you claimed the previous Disney+ Perk, you should still be able to claim this one - but it can only be activated on a new Disney+ subscriber account. 
If you're thinking of only using the trial for that 30-day period, remember that like most subscription trials you'll need to manually cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period if you don't want to get charged for the next month. So if you're planning on tuning in just for Loki, you might want to wait a bit before activating your trial: the first episode releases today, but the finale airs on 14th July. Or for Clone Wars spin-off series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, you'll want to make sure your trial period includes the finale airing on 30th July.

This is the first of Ubisoft's upcoming big budget free-to-play experiments with its core franchises. A few bits and pieces have leaked out from closed testing, despite Ubisoft's wishes.

        <updated>2021-06-09T10:18:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're still waiting for that big Heath and Home update, but in the meantime developer Iron Gate has rolled out another small patch to fix some of Valheim's bugs. This patch makes two previously-bugged raid events actually trigger in-game, and provides a number of other handy fixes to make your time in the 10th world slightly easier. Slightly. 
The two events fixed in this update are "you are being hunted" and "the horde is attacking", which were previously in the game files but didn't trigger as expected. According to the Valheim wiki, the hunt event is supposed to spawn a bunch of wolves, while the horde event should summon a goblin army of Fulings (including Berserkers and Shamans). 
The exact conditions for triggering these events are currently unknown, but the pattern established by previous events suggests the hunt event could require killing one wolf and Moder, while the horde raid should occur in-between killing Moder and the final boss. So if you're currently in the late-game, things are about to get a bit spicier.

Descenders, if you're unfamiliar, serves up an exhilarating freeriding experience as players - either solo or competitively - race, trick, and flip their way across a procedurally generated world. It was warmly received at launch, but really made its mark - and found a significant audience - once it released on Xbox Game Pass.
Following the game's well-deserved, and continuing, success on Microsoft's subscription service, RageSquid announced it was working on a next-gen enhancements upgrade for Xbox Series X/S - and that update is now finally here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have already seen some mutterings about this on social media, but E3's online portal opened up to press this week - and to nobody's surprise, it's a real mess. This year's E3 is all-online thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and the portal is supposed to be some sort of substitute for the physical show, featuring virtual booths for exhibitors, online events, and a variety of articles and bits of content about games.
The portal goes a little further than you might expect, however, with old-school internet forums, an avatar system and a gamified rewards system. The latter is what really caught my attention, as not only can you earn points from nosing around the portal, but you can also compete in online leaderboards  to see who is The Biggest E3 Fan. Naturally, this appealed to my competitive side and I set out to land myself a spot at the top of the virtual podium. "With a limited pool of games media, this will be a cinch," I thought. But alas, my attempts to do so were foiled by an unexpected enemy: the E3 portal itself. 
Things started off pretty well. After doing some strange password reset shenanigans to actually get into my account, the E3 website presented me with an avatar creator (if you've ever heard of a picrew, it's basically that). I don't know why the avatar creator exists, but I think it might also be the best part of the E3 website. It's surprisingly lenient with what it will allow you to do - there are colour wheels for your hair and eyes, and you can even move your facial features around. Don't expect the sort of silliness you can get from something like Nintendo's Mii Maker, but the E3 avatar creator isn't afraid to get a little weird:

Expect updates on what's next for Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Rise, as well as a look ahead to July's Monster Hunter Stories 2 and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.
So, what do we expect for Resident Evil Village? Well, Capcom is yet to talk about post-launch single-player support for the game, if there is any. More likely, perhaps, we may get a glimpse of new bits and pieces coming to its PVE Mercenaries mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is your Russian feeling a little rusty? Not to worry, as an English translation for Fallout 2 mod Olympus 2207 has finally been released - so you can put the Russian dictionary down for now. 
Olympus 2207 is a huge total conversion mod for Fallout 2 that was released back in December 2014, and at long last, it now has an official English translation. The developers used Fallout 2's engine and basic mechanics to create a new story that's unconnected to the Fallout series: it adapts features like Fallout 2's skills and perks system, but adds new graphics, additional gameplay mechanics, and - of course - a bunch of new stories and quests. There's even a crafting system, a mini-game for hacking electronic panels, and a flexible structure with no main quest. "Do you want to become the tyrant of Radius, or do you want to improve the lives of everyone in it?," the official mod page explains. "The choice is yours!"
As explained in the lore section of the mod's website, the game takes place in the year 2207 in the Silicon Valley region of the US. The Great War of 2013 created an irradiated wasteland, and while some managed to escape into improvised shelters (or a luxurious vault called Livos), many had to "adapt to the new conditions on the evolutionary, genetic level". Sounds rough. Anyway, some lucky survivors found themselves inside a skyscraper called Olympus when this all went down. The game centres on this skyscraper, which everyone in the wasteland seems desperate to enter: it promises energy with its solar panels and protection from the horrors outside. If you can get past the guards at the bottom, however.

There's also a revamped battle pass system which has done away with the traditional levels 1-100 grind. Instead, levelling will give you "Stars" to spend on specific rewards you want, laid out over pages. Some items will require you to have finished off the rest of the page first, tempting you to level up further, but this should make nabbing individual items easier.
In the story trailer, we see the Fortnite island's inhabitants react to the arrival of an Independence Day-sized UFO, which hovers over the island and then appears to suck up its Zero Point energy source, destroying last season's Spire and primal ruins in the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has been delayed twice since its initial unveiling last September, now won't arrival until some time next year.
Originally, the Sands of Time remake - which is being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai - was due to launch this January, but the publisher postponed its release to March at the end of last year. When February arrived, however, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the game once more, this time indefinitely, while it worked on delivering "a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original".
All's been quite on the news front since then, but in a new statement posted to Twitter - ostensibly confirming that the remake will be absent from this year's Ubisoft Forward livestream - the publisher has shared a revised release window of 2022 for the remake.

Yes, those deafening mass relay jumps are now quieter - something many fans had called on BioWare to fix for years.
Mass Effect's intergalactic jump points have always been noisy, though the otherwise excellent Legendary Edition has surprised some newer players (or those yet to experience hearing loss) when they find out how loud mass relays are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Royal Games, an online games portal owned by Candy Crush maker King, has come under fire from paying customers who have been unable to cash out their funds. 
The freeze on withdrawals was a consequence of King being investigated by PayPal over how Royal Games operates in specific countries. 
After a lengthy investigation by Eurogamer, the site's withdrawal page has now become available again, though the site continues to no longer accept real-world money deposits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the start of the weekend we heard that CD Projekt's stolen data was being shared online, and it seems the floodgates are now well and truly open. A bunch of dev-made bug compilation videos are now circulating on social media and file-sharing sites, showing some rarely-seen work-in-progress builds and rather spectacular bugs.  
As Eurogamer reported on Friday, some dev videos had already started to leak alongside the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 and Thronebreaker, and it appears many of these are now being shared on 4chan, Reddit and YouTube. Most of the videos are being shared using video hosting platform Streamable, but many are now being pulled offline (they are, after all, the result of an illegal ransomware hack). 
Some are short clips showing the player-character being ricocheted into the sky to the sound of Shooting Stars, or being knocked out only to wake up to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim opening. Others are more complex - one compilation shows several bugs with an off-tune recorder version of Spoiler (the track by DJ Hyper used in Cyberpunk's 2018 E3 trailer). Another lengthy edit called "CyberElBuggado2020" shows hotdog motorbikes, NPCs T-posing to the sound of Thriller, and Johnny Silverhand saying "this is going to be a disaster" in Spanish.

In a tweet, Naka said he left Square Enix at the end of April. Balan Wonderworld, which Naka directed and Square Enix published on multiple platforms in March, flopped at retail. It sold less than 2100 copies in its opening week in Japan, and failed to make the top 40 in the UK physical chart.
On his departure from Square Enix, Naka said: "I can't talk about the reason now, but I hope I can talk about it when the time comes. As for future activities, I'm 55 years old, so I may retire."

As reported by Polygon, designer Judy A. Juracek filed a lawsuit in a Connecticut court on Friday that alleges Capcom used unlicensed copyrighted photos for the creation of some of its games - and even for the Resident Evil 4 logo.
At the heart of this lawsuit is Juracek's book, Surfaces, a visual research for artists, architects and designers that includes 1200 photographs of textures she took herself. Surfaces, which was originally published in 1996, includes a CD-ROM of the images, which require a licence for commercial use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvelous and Grasshopper Manufacture's cult-hack-and-slash adventures No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle are heading to Steam next Wednesday, 9th June.
First released on Wii in 2007, No More Heroes follows the stylish, frequently ludicrous, and dependably ultra-violent adventures of Travis Touchdown, an ordinary game and anime geek who inadvertently becomes embroiled with the United Assassins Association.
What follows is a third-person hack-and-slash romp, replete with a phenomenal soundtrack, that sees Travis - lightsaber-like beam Katana in hand - murdering his way through the Association's top-ranked assassins in order to stay alive. If you've never played the game before, expect geysers of blood, a winningly weird sense of humour, and (rather barren) bike-based open-world interludes in amongst the spirited and largely entertaining action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its surprise appearance during a fiscal year financial presentation last week, publisher 505 Games has confirmed that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the acclaimed 2019 Castlevania spiritual successor from Koji Igarashi and developer ArtPlay, is getting a sequel.
Word of a sequel originally surfaced after keen-eyed internet sorts spotted a bullet point inserted into 505 Games' latest fiscal year financial results, stating a "second version" of  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was in development.
Although the term "second version" left a certain ambiguity as to whether this was referring to a sequel or something else, 505 has now offered clarity in a development update on Reddit. "Regarding recent reports," it wrote, "[505 Games and Artplay] are in very early planning stages for a Bloodstained sequel".

2021 marks the second year running that Summer Games Done Quick is going online-only - traditionally, shows have been ticketed real-world events, with all speedrunning showcases being streamed online - and the precautions established last year will remain in place to "ensure the continued safety of our attendees, runners, volunteers, and staff", according to organisers.
Even without the live-event element, there's still plenty to look forward to, with this year's show offering a full seven days of speedrunning, from Sunday, 4th July, to 11th July.

        <updated>2021-06-04T15:50:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, CD Projekt confirmed it had been hit by a "targeted cyber attack" that saw its internal systems compromised and sensitive information held to ransom. After CD Projekt said it would not comply with the group's demands, the hackers announced that source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent and an unreleased version of The Witcher 3 would be auctioned to the highest bidder, and source code for Gwent was publicly leaked. 
At the time, the hackers claimed they had received a satisfying offer for the information, and the auction was then closed with a condition of "no further distribution" agreed with the buyer. But that stolen data now appears to have resurfaced, with source code, assets and software development kits for platforms including the PlayStation 5 seemingly being shared online. Eurogamer has also seen internal development videos showing work-in-progress builds of Cyberpunk 2077. 
According to security blog DataBreaches.net, earlier this week a threat actor group decided to release CD Projekt's information in order to promote its new leaks platform. A note from the hackers was also discovered by security software provider Emsisoft back in March (via IT Pro), and an uncensored version of this was shared on 4chan yesterday (the link provided in the note no longer works, but the data is now being shared elsewhere). The note claims the release of the stolen information is part of a "charity fundraising" effort - although as the group is asking for payment in cryptocurrency, there's no way to guarantee that's actually going to a good cause.

The mobile version of NetherRealm's fighting game was accused of being "tone deaf" after an in-game challenge designed to celebrate Pride Month tasked players with defeating canonically bisexual character Poison Ivy hundreds of thousands of times.
Rewards for completing the community challenge included Harley Quinn tokens - a nod to Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn's romantic relationship in DC Comics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has once again turned its attention to virtual reality of the PlayStation kind, with another of its PSVR showcases - and if you missed its various announcements, you can catch up below.
First up, Sniper Elite VR - unsurprisingly a virtual reality spin on developer Rebellion's long-range FPS series - will be launching on 8th July. The studio is promising a "powerful World War 2 story" told through the eyes of an Italian Partisan, said to deliver a "new perspective" on the franchise's acclaimed stealth and sniping action.
Next up is a reveal for new game Wanderer, created by M Theory and Oddboy. This one's an immersive time travel adventure - melding narrative-driven exploration, puzzling, and mini-games - in which you're able to embody some of history's most famous explorers, inventors, and conquerors as you hop back and forth between ancient civilisations, war time, the hippie-hued 60s, even the far flung, post-apocalyptic future. Wanderer is due to arrive this summer.

        <updated>2021-06-03T19:04:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust is infamous for having a pretty hostile player base - something I learned the hard way when I first started playing - but a change arriving this month could make it easier to avoid your worst neighbours. A new "contact system" is being rolled out as part of Rust's June update, and it will highlight those who have done bad things to you. 
"Upon meeting a new player they'll be logged into your contacts and the contact system will now keep a history of all interactions (good, bad, indifferent, rage-inducing etc)," Facepunch explained in a press release. "To help quickly identify friend from foe, players' nameplates will now display blue for friendly and red for hostile. Waving at players will reveal your name (it doesn't always pay to be nice...) and using binoculars will reveal if a player is unknown, hostile or friendly from large distances."
On the surface, it sounds similar to the way hostile players are marked in Red Dead Online with a red dot or star depending on their recent actions. With Rust, however, it seems like it will be up to the individual to categorise other players: you can designate someone as an enemy, for instance, and make notes on each player you meet. Seems like a handy way to keep track of all those nakeds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontier has released a second major update for space sim Elite Dangerous' poorly received Odyssey expansion, bringing a raft of much-needed improvements, ranging from UI enhancements and graphics optimisations to AI tweaks and many, many bug fixes.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched last month, quickly accruing a 'Mostly Negative' rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.
As the negative reviews continued, Frontier Developments boss David Braben stepped in, releasing a statement apologising "to those who have been suffering from these problems" and insisting that addressing Odyssey's myriad reported issues was the studio's "priority and focus."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been casting a curious eye at developer 11 Bit Studios' celebrated post-apocalyptic city builder Frostpunk but have yet to experience its brutal survival charms, now's the perfect time to do so, as it's currently free on the Epic Games Store.
Frostpunk, which launched to much acclaim in 2018, is a fascinating, if decidedly gruelling, experience. It's a sort of narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder, challenging players to stay alive and, as much as is possible in Frostpunk's desolate sub-zero world, thrive.
That's done by establishing a settlement with a vast generator at its centre, a precariously fuel-hungry device intended to provide some degree of warmth for your population as, at your command, they set about scavenging the land for supplies needed to expand their new home.

It's an MMO I've been following since it Kickstarted in 2015 (after which it raised more money via player investment and in-game property sales), and one I've played a bit of recently. It's a slightly tricky one to explain.
In general, it's an online fantasy game about fighting other players. That is the point. There's a bit of monster fighting, but only really to serve as a tutorial while you quickly level up. There's a level-cap of 30 which you can get quite close to in a few hours if you're speedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few months, Apex Legends players have increasingly reported problems with DDoS attacks in their games: one moment they've been sliding their way around World's Edge, the next, their game has frozen and they've been booted out. It's become a particular issue in Ranked games, where miscreants have used DDoS attacks to artificially boost themselves up the leaderboards. Hoovering up a bunch of disconnected opponents is easier than actually playing the game, after all. 
Respawn has already indicated it's taking the situation seriously - banning some behind high-profile cases, and mentioning that it's even considering legal action against those carrying out the attacks. But it seems progress is being made towards a more permanent solution, with security analyst Conor "Hideouts" Ford explaining on Twitter that significant progress has been made on a fix. 
"The DDoS situation is being addressed as we speak by our very own @ricklesauceur [lead software engineer Samy Duc]," Ford said. "It isn't the easiest fix in the world but huge steps are being made to take care of this."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bend Studio, perhaps best known as the developer behind 2019's post-apocalyptic bikes-and-zombies adventure Days Gone, has revealed it's working on a new IP.
Days Gone - which initially launched on PS4 before making it way to PC earlier this year - was the studio's first crack at a new IP since its acquisition by Sony in 2000; prior to that game, the developer was largely known for adapting the likes of Uncharted and Resistance for Sony's handheld consoles, the PSP and Vita.
Announcing its next project in a statement on Twitter,  Bend wrote, "We are beyond grateful for your support with Days Gone and are truly honoured by the amount of passion our community has shared with us for our world and characters. Your enthusiasm motivates us to continue to improve and create experiences that will last a lifetime."

Prisms, No Man's Sky's 17th named update since its release back in 2016, touches up the game's visual presentation pretty much across the board. Planets, for instance, get enhanced weather effects - Hello Games highlights rain, which now refracts the light and causes surfaces to become slick and wet - while underground caves become more detailed, with improved lighting and volumetric fog.
Planetary fauna, meanwhile, has been overhauled with proper fur effects and, as a bonus, flying creatures - which were sadly neglected in No Man's Sky's taming-based Companions update - can now be adopted and ridden through the sky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Biomutant developer Experiment 101 has, as promised, released an update for the game that makes significant changes.
Chief among them is the ability to shut the annoying narrator up. Biomutant's incorporeal narrator is certainly pretty chatty, commenting on pretty much everything you do and translating everything anyone says. Prior to the release of this patch, while you were able to tone the narrator down, you couldn't shut him up completely. Now you can.
Here are the relevant patch notes:

The cut footage was found back in 2019 via an old VHS tape, but was in poor quality. Since then, a group has worked on restoring the long-lost version, which is now available to watch in full via the Internet Archive.
As officially released, Super Mario Bros. was 104 minutes. This new version - dubbed the Morton Jankel Cut in honour of its husband and wife director team - runs 125 minutes, with most scenes extended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis, the standalone-expansion-style next instalment in Sega's long-running free-to-play online action-RPG series, will - following its beta last month - be making its way to Xbox and PC next Wednesday, 9th June.
Announced last summer, New Genesis is described as the "next-generation" of Phantasy Star Online 2, and catapults the action forward 1,000 years after the Oracle's battle in PSO2.
Bundled alongside the base game, it includes a new graphics engine, enhanced character models, a new multi-weapon system, and, most notably, a "wide-open battlefield" with changing time and weather, traversable using new abilities like the Photon Dash and Photon Glide. There's also cross-platform play, plus fully localised text and character voices in English.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All three episodes of Life is Strange developer Dontnod's well-received supernatural mystery adventure Tell Me Why are currently free on PC and Xbox.
Tell Me Why, if you're unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the picturesque Alaskan town of Delos Crossing - a task that ultimately forces them to confront their traumatic past.
What follows is a deft blend of supernatural mystery thriller and earnest, character-driven homecoming drama - there's real beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists - that's arguably Dontnod's most assured, consistently enjoyable outing yet, even if its perhaps not quite as devastatingly memorable as its Life is Strange forebears.
