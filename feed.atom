<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eavesdropping from the user&#8217;s smartphone is a well-known threat to the user&#8217;s safety and privacy. Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.26 includes significant advancements in network traffic engineering with the graduation of
two features (Service internal traffic policy support, and EndpointSlice terminating conditions) to GA,
and a third feature (Proxy terminating endpoints) to beta. The combination of these enhancements aims
to address short-comings in traffic engineering that people face today, and unlock new capabilities for the future.
Traffic Loss from Load Balancers During Rolling Updates
Prior to Kubernetes v1.26, clusters could experience loss of traffic
from Service load balancers during rolling updates when setting the externalTrafficPolicy field to Local.

The Kubernetes 1.26 release includes a stable implementation of the Job
controller that can reliably track a large amount of Jobs with high levels of
parallelism. SIG Apps
and WG Batch
have worked on this foundational improvement since Kubernetes 1.22. After
multiple iterations and scale verifications, this is now the default
implementation of the Job controller.
Paired with the Indexed completion mode,
the Job controller can handle massively parallel batch Jobs, supporting up to
100k concurrent Pods.
The new implementation also made possible the development of Pod failure policy,
which is in beta in the 1.26 release.
How do I use this feature?
To use Job tracking with finalizers, upgrade to Kubernetes 1.25 or newer and
create new Jobs. You can also use …]]></summary>

Remember when Nintendo released its first update for Mario Kart 7 in 10 years? Well, it turns out that was to address a critical exploit that "could allow an attacker to achieve full console takeover".

Whilst the issue was reportedly first noted back in 2021, PabloMK7, Rambo6Glaz, Fishguy6564 have been credited with the discovery of "ENLBufferPwn", an exploit so serious, it was given a critical score of 9.8/10 in the CVSS 3.1 calculator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka says that 2022 was "the biggest year in Sonic history" for fans of the blue blur.

But as well as referencing the game's movie sequel, Netflix show, and Sonic Origins and Sonic Frontiers - all of which dropped in 2022, of course - Iizuka teased that there was "a lot more outside of that" still to come, too.

"This past year was the biggest year in Sonic history, including the release of the movie sequel, new titles Sonic Origins and Sonic Frontiers, and the Netflix animation Sonic Prime," Sonic Team's Iizuka told Famitsu (thanks, Gematsu and Nintendo Life).

As well as the games developed by studios outside of China, 84 domestic games have also been given the green light in China, which Reuters calls "the world's largest gaming market".

Chinese megacorps like Tencent and NetEase are amongst those receiving approval, with the former reportedly securing licences for six of its games in December.

According to the Instagram account of PromoBricks - a Lego site that's successfully revealed unconfirmed Lego sets ahead of time before - the sets vary in size and complexity and will cost between $30 and $100 (that's £25 to £82, although the final localised price may differ).

Beyond that, however, not much else is known, but you can get a sneaky peek at what the sets may entail in the image shared by PromoBricks (thanks, VGC).

According to NHK and spotted by VGC, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office's Special Investigation Department have indicted Naka and Taisuke Sasaki for investing millions of yen in a company based on insider information that had yet to be made public.

The prosecutors allege that neither Naka nor Saskai would have invested the ¥144.7m if they hadn't known Square Enix was about to announce a partnership with a mobile developer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve's new Steam Replay feature is here with a handy summary of your 2022 PC playtime.

Just like PlayStation's annual Wrap-Up feature, Steam Replay tots up "all of your playtime between the first second of January 1 and the last second of December 14 (GMT)" - albeit only the games you've played whilst online; offline play and time spent "running tools" is not included - and presents it as a convenient infographic.

As well as a highlight panel that shows how much time you've spent on the games that have kept you busiest over the last 12 months (for me, it's been indie ghosthunting hit Phasmophobia), you also get a summary of your achievements - including the "rare" ones - and your longest streak, as well as data that lets you know how you compare with the rest of Steam's community.

In an interview with the New Yorker (thanks, Comicbook), Druckmann said he hoped that the show will "put that video-game curse to bed", although screenwriter Craig Mazin acknowledged that it's "not the highest bar in the world" to become a great adaptation given some games, like Assassin's Creed, have "impenetrable" storylines.

"I love the ability to wander, to do nothing, in Skyrim," Mazin said, before adding that "that is not translatable!" By contrast, however, he said that "The Last of Us was always a story where the story comes first".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has hit back at Sony's objection to its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard by revealing that third-party games like Bloodborne, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Final Fantasy 16, and Silent Hill 2 Remake are party to "exclusion" agreements that will prevent those games from coming to Xbox consoles.

The news comes as part of Microsoft's response to the FTC's lawsuit against its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In the filing, Microsoft defends its position by turning the spotlight back onto Sony, detailing a handful of "prominent" games the company alleges have been barred from release on Xbox.

Whilst the filing acknowledges that "exclusivity strategies are not uncommon in the games industry", Microsoft seems to take issue with Sony's partnerships with third-party publishers, namely From Software, Square Enix, and Konami.

Like many artists, senior artist Frank Aliberti - who currently works as a senior character artist at 2K but formerly worked for PlayStation Studios Visual Arts - has his credits listed on ArtStation. 

It's Aliberti's work with PlayStation Studios Visual Arts that's caught our collective attention, however, as Aliberti's most recent credit indicated that they had worked as a senior artist on Death Stranding 2.

The CPU Manager is a part of the kubelet, the Kubernetes node agent, which enables the user to allocate exclusive CPUs to containers.
Since Kubernetes v1.10, where it graduated to Beta, the CPU Manager proved itself reliable and
fulfilled its role of allocating exclusive CPUs to containers, so adoption has steadily grown making it a staple component of performance-critical
and low-latency setups. Over time, most changes were about bugfixes or internal refactoring, with the following noteworthy user-visible changes:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author: Wei Huang (Apple), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google)
Kubernetes 1.26 introduced a new Pod feature: scheduling gates. In Kubernetes, scheduling gates
are keys that tell the scheduler when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.
What problem does it solve?
When a Pod is created, the scheduler will continuously attempt to find a node that fits it. This
infinite loop continues until the scheduler either finds a node for the Pod, or the Pod gets deleted.
Pods that remain unschedulable for long periods of time (e.g., ones that are blocked on some external event)
waste scheduling cycles. A scheduling cycle may take ≅20ms or more depending on the complexity of
the Pod's scheduling constraints. Therefore, at scale, those wasted cycles significantly impact the
scheduler's performance. See …]]></summary>

Now almost two months on, players fear the Valderas Museum will never return. Season One saw the return of fan favourite maps Shoothouse and Shipment, but players criticised the paltry number of maps released. One wonders why Infinity Ward hasn't released a map that is seemingly complete and ready to ship. 


But players have taken it upon themselves to answer this question. Some have noticed the map's striking resemblance to the real-life Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Meta Quest VR headsets, has agreed to pay $725m to settle a class-action lawsuit which accused the company of allowing Cambridge Analytica to access personal user data without consent. 


The Cambridge Analytica scandal goes all the way back to 2018, when former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie disclosed to The Guardian and The New York Times that the UK-based company had scraped extensive data from Facebook without the explicit consent of users. 


The scandal led to investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and the UK's Information Commissioner's Office issuing a £500,000 fine to Facebook (this was before the GDPR had come into force, which allows for significantly higher financial penalties) and the US' Federal Trade Commission issuing a $5bn fine.

The game's Steam page is now up and running.


The Division 2 launches on Steam nearly four years after it came out on PC and console in March 2019. Back then, Ubisoft's deal with Epic meant the PC versions of its games launched on the Epic Games Store as well as Ubisoft's own storefront, but not Steam, much to the annoyance of PC gamers.

That eye-watering figure came from Polyphony Digital CEO Kazunori Yamauchi as part of a message to fans to celebrate 25 years of the racing sim.


While Sony hasn't announced it as such, Gran Turismo is PlayStation's best-selling franchise. Much of that has to do with its longevity - there has been a Gran Turismo game on every PlayStation home console ever released.

Also of note from the update is the addition of dip switches, a throwback to arcade machines whose dip switches let operators adjust game difficult (and rinse your pocket money in the process).

The headline here is the addition of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, which came out in November 2019 and is set to get a sequel, Jedi Survivor, in March. The addition of Fallen Order to PS Plus Essential next month is well-timed in that context.


Elsewhere, Bethesda's online-focused RPG Fallout 76 joins PS Plus Essential next month (it's already in the PlayStation Plus Extra tier). Just yesterday we reported on how Fallout 76 has an impressive 13.5m players four years after its disastrous launch. I imagine joining PS Plus Essential will only fuel the player count.

Delegation of fsGroup to CSI drivers was first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes 1.22,

This diorama puzzler from developer Light Brick Studio is yours to claim until tomorrow (22nd December) at 4pm. After that, Epic will unveil its next mystery giveaway.

Previously a legacy feature of the original Warzone, a Loadout Drop let players and their squad use custom-made loadouts rather than the weapons scavenged in the battle royale. 


While Loadout Drops would randomly spawn in the game world, buying a Loadout Drop grenade from a Buy Station would let you request a drop on demand.

Speaking to Game Informer, director Stig Asmussen stated players will discover "five fully realised stances in the game" for protagonist Cal Kestis, including a dedicated dual blade option and Kylo Ren-esque crossguard-style lightsaber (both of which were glimpsed in the most recent gameplay trailer, which you can see below).


As you may already have assumed, Asmussen said it will be "advantageous to use certain types of stances against certain types of enemies". This, the director says, will require the player to "break down the enemies and figure out what the best weapon of choice is".

The two faced each other while playing for their respective national teams in the World Cup final on Sunday, with the result securing Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time. But it also brought on a headache for the young Mbappe who scored a hat-trick in the match. 


Now the two will fly back to Paris to play together once again, and some have wondered what the changing room talk might be like.

Reporting its half year results to 30th September 2022, the Paris-based company admitted any delays in the development of its four activities (gaming, hardware, licensing and blockchain), or underperformance in its initiatives may cause it to make less money than expected, and in turn spark "a liquidity shortfall and additional financing requirements".

The trailer in question (which I have seen) introduced an NPC known as Shaun. It was a playful set up that showed Shaun being interviewed about his work on Goat Simulator 3. 


Here he boasted about his impressive rag-dolling skills (he went to the "most prestigious rag-dolling school in the world", you see), and reflected that sometimes he just sits on a bench and ponders the world at large. All in all, some fairly inoffensive stuff.

In a hand-on preview, The Verge noticed that battery life was noticeably worse than the base DualSense controller, and this was later confirmed to the publication in a statement. 


"The DualSense Edge wireless controller's operating time is moderately shorter than the original DualSense wireless controller," a Sony spokesperson said. "We wanted to strike a good balance between wireless operating time and delivering robust, high-performance features."

According to the patch notes, the hotfix should "improve overall stability and performance of the game, and fix GOG & Steam overlays." 


Stability and performance improvements is of course the catch-all phrase used by developers to group a large number of small fixes, but we do know from reports of PC users that problems included framerate drops and slow texture loading.

Sundae Month and publisher Kitfox Games announced this news as part of Nintendo's House of Indies: Holiday Event yesterday, promising Switch owners that soon they will be able to use their photography skills to snap all the best shots of shibas, terriers, labs, pugs, and more. "You want 'em, WE GOT EM!" the Pupperazzi team proclaimed.


But it is not just taking pictures. Along with getting nice photos of your canine compatriots, you will also be able to play fetch with them, dress them up in a variety of outfits, have a dance party (or should that be paw-ty) with them and "terrorise them with vacuum cleaners" (but would you really want to do that?). You can even see them in action at the skatepark - in fact, Pupperazzi's entire world is populated with dogs, dogs and yet more dogs. You can see what I mean in the trailer below.

Squanch Games and Justin Roiland's effort is now the most popular game in Microsoft's subscription - in both its PC and console catalogues. 


On Xbox consoles, more people are playing High on Life through Game Pass than other popular titles such as Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, FIFA 22 and Rainbow Six Siege. Indeed, it is currently being played by more people than any first-party Microsoft release, including Minecraft, Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite and Sea of Thieves.

The research found that the Joy-Con's plastic circuit boards showed noticeable wear on the joystick slider contact points, despite only being used for months. It is this wear that ultimately results in drifting. 


In addition, dust and other contaminants were found in the Switch's internal components, despite attempts by Nintendo at dustproofing said areas.

In Kubernetes 1.26, the 1st alpha release of validating admission policies is
available!
Validating admission policies use the Common Expression
Language (CEL) to offer a declarative,
in-process alternative to validating admission
webhooks.
CEL was first introduced to Kubernetes for the Validation rules for
CustomResourceDefinitions.
This enhancement expands the use of CEL in Kubernetes to support a far wider
range of admission use cases.
Admission webhooks can be burdensome to develop and operate. Webhook developers
must implement and maintain a webhook binary to handle admission requests. Also,
admission webhooks are complex to operate. Each webhook must be deployed,
monitored and have a well defined upgrade and rollback plan. To make matte…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Federal Trade Commission has hit Fortnite maker Epic Games with a record-breaking penalty of $520m (£427m) over allegations it previously employed "lax privacy practices" for voice and text chat, and used design tricks to "dupe millions of players" into unintentional purchases. 


The eye-opening judgment includes the largest-ever settlement obtained by the FTC regarding the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, as Fortnite allowed in-game chat and user data collection by default. 


Fortnite holds a "Teen" rating by the US ratings board ESRB, but the FTC has argued Epic Games knew many of its users were likely under 13 years of age and had not obtained their parents' consent.

The entire tournament was simulated inside FIFA 23, which outputted Argentina as the ultimate winners, with Lionel Messi winning the Golden Boot and Emi Martínez winning the Golden Glove awards. The predictions were published November 8th, long before the tournament had started. 


The game's ability to predict the winner for the fourth time in a row is a testament to the accuracy of FIFA's official rankings, but of course the uncertainty of the real world means that not everything was predicted correctly.

EA's mega-successful football series is a frequent winner of the Christmas number one crown, and last week likely saw a further boost in sales due to the attention surrounding the controversial World Cup in Qatar.


FIFA games have now taken the Christmas top spot 10 times since sales records began back in 1984, making it the most popular Christmas number one franchise (versus Call of Duty's nine Christmas chart toppers).

With the recent release of Kubernetes v1.26, Device Manager is now generally

Within the kubelet, the Device Manager facilitates communication with device plugins

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark's festive Wreck the Halls update is now live.

As well as ushering in the Summoner Advanced class - which brings a "powerful variety of water, lightning, earth, and more unique attacks" to the MMORPG - we'll also meet the "cunning and ruthless" Phantom Legion Commander and get a new Guardian raid that takes on Caliligos, "the master of lightning", too. 

"Caliligos is the master of lightning, commanding blue lightning to bring his enemies to their knees," Amazon teases, confirming that he will join the gauntlet of Level 6 Guardians and an Item Level on 1490 is required to challenge him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Microsoft is considering introducing cheaper, ad-supported tiers of its Xbox Game Pass.

That's according to a survey Microsoft recently circulated to players, inviting views about the current Xbox Game Pass subscription and querying if we'd be willing to accept adverts if the subscription payment was lower.

An unsourced screenshot, written in Spanish and shared on ResetEra (via VGC), alleges that Microsoft is surveying players and exploring a tier-like system - similar to that of Ubisoft+ and Sony's PS Plus - by inviting them to "consider hypothetical subscriptions".

Ubisoft has been pretty quiet about the game so far, and even the name remains under wraps for now. But that hasn't stopped the studio from putting out a public call to players, inviting them to join the playtest team.

"Be part of something great," the studio teases on its sign-up page. "Nothing beats the feeling of being part of the creation of a completely new game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta's VR consulting CTO, John Carmack, is leaving the company after "a decade in VR", accusing the firm of "self-sabotage".

In an internal note seen by Business Insider, Carmack criticised the company's "efficiency", adding that despite Quest 2 being "almost exactly what [he] wanted to see" with its "mobile hardware, inside out tracking, optional PC streaming, 4K(ish) software", he was "offended" at seeing a "5 per cent GPU utilisation number in production".

"We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort," Carmack - who co-created the Doom and Quake franchises - said in the leaked memo. "There is no way to sugarcoat this; I think our organisation is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playtest footage reportedly taken from Assassin's Creed Jade has leaked online.

Allegedly posted to an Assassin's Creed Facebook page and then, in turn, shared with Assassin's Creed and Gaming Leaks and Rumours on Reddit, the footage - which runs for 2.40 mins - was seemingly captured on an Apple mobile device and depicts a combat-heavy sequence, which includes cut-scenes and combat tutorials. You can watch it here. 

Whilst it's not the first we've seen of Jade - Ubisoft dropped a polished teaser earlier this year - it is the first time we've seen raw footage like this (thanks, TheGamer). As always, you can't necessarily expect the final product to look and/or play this way - this is likely a very, very early version of the game - and, as always, if you're interested, you should probably check it out sooner rather than later: these things have a habit of disappearing within a day or two.

In an interview with NME, Schafer revealed that when he started making games back in the '80s, there was "a lot less sensitivity" around, but between developing 2005's Psychonauts and its 2021 sequel, he'd "learned a lot" and was "thinking about how [his] art will be interpreted by the viewer".

"I thought I'd learned a lot, and then we tested a game, and people pointed out a word and asked if we knew what this word means to certain people," the Schafer said. "I had no idea – and people will criticise that and say 'woke culture, PC police' and stuff – but for any art, I'm thinking about how my art will be interpreted by the viewer.

As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Criterion's vice president and general manager Matt Webster has left the studio after 23 years, as has head of studio development and 17-year Criterion veteran Alan McDairmant.


They're joined by senior technical director Andrei Shires, who has been with the company for 16 years, as well as executive producer Pete Lake, who first joined Criterion in 1996. Head of content Steve Uphill also leaves following his most recent 10-year stint at Criterion. All are said to have left the developer to "explore new opportunities outside of EA".

Kubernetes v1.24 introduced an alpha quality implementation of improvements
for handling a non-graceful node shutdown.
In Kubernetes v1.26, this feature moves to beta. This feature allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node after the original node is shut down or in a non-recoverable state, such as the hardware failure or broken OS.
What is a node shutdown in Kubernetes?
In a Kubernetes cluster, it is possible for a node to shut down. This could happen either in a planned way or it could happen unexpectedly. You may plan for a security patch, or a kernel upgrade and need to reboot the node, or it may shut down due to preemption of VM instances. A node may also shut down due to a hardware failure or a software problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla Games has confirmed a new co-op-focused online Horizon project is currently in the works at the studio.


Reports of a co-op component for the Horizon series first emerged in 2020, when VGC claimed the studio had initially been looking to implement the feature as part of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn before ditching it to focus on other areas. Co-op was then said to have been revived for Horizon Forbidden West, potentially as a separate mode, but again didn't make the final cut.


As confirmed by Guerilla's recruitment-focused Twitter feed, however, the studio's co-op dreams are still very much alive, with the company currently hiring for an internally developed "separate online project" in the Horizon universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spare a thought for poor old Henry Cavill: once wearer of the gangly locks as Geralt of Rivia, once bearer of the bulgy bits as Superman, now no longer either. But on the bright side, his lovely dog's now in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, courtesy of its new-gen update.


Henry Cavill's dog, an American Akita named Kal, is a bit of a star in his own right, frequently snapped alongside the actor and apparently a bit of a fixture on-set of Cavill's projects. During filming of The Witcher, for instance, Kal was said to have been on location the "entire time". 


And now Kal has been immortalised in digital form, appearing at the Devil's Pit for players that get the "good" ending in The Witcher 3's new quest In The Eternal Fire's Shadow, introduced as part of CD Projekt's long-in-the-works new-gen update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years after announcing his departure from Blizzard Entertainment, and his retirement from the games industry at large, long-serving Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen is returning to the company as creative advisor on the Warcraft franchise.


Metzen's retirement from Blizzard in 2016 came as a shock to many a fan. He'd been with the company for 23 years at that point, serving as head writer and lore guru (or, more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) and had become one of its most recognisable faces across countless BlizzCons.


"The reason I use the word 'retire'", Metzen explained in a statement at the time of his departure, "is because I'm not going to some other company or starting up new projects or anything remotely like that. It's been a long, amazing stretch of years. Now it's time to slow it down. Rest. Lay around on the couch and get fat."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima's idiosyncratic post-apocalyptic courier adventure Death Stranding is the latest in an increasingly long line of video games to get the movie treatment, courtesy of a newly announced collaboration between Kojima Productions and Barbarian executive producer Alex Lebovici's Hammerstone Studios.


Death Stranding, for those unfamiliar, stars The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier trying to make ends meet in an aggressively wet corner of rural Wales. One day, his clothes unexpectedly fall off, a baby turns into goo, ...fish?! Then, walking!!!!


Okay, so that's not exactly how it goes (although it's not not, either) but it's fair to say Death Stranding's atmospheric tale of a post-apocalyptic United States - which, yes, does look at awful lot like Wales - is not short of wonderfully outlandish ideas. There are eerily invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, a mysterious plane of existence known as the Beach, and much, much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insomniac has confirmed Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the eagerly awaited sequel to 2018's acclaimed open-world swing-em-up - will arrive on PS5 next "fall".


That's not, admittedly, anywhere close to being an actual launch date, but at least fans can now update their diaries and keep their anticipation in check. And the not particularly specific announcement may have something to do with the fact the "fall 2023" release was leaked earlier this week after a writer on the project added the date (since removed) to their online CV.


Official confirmation, however, has now arrived courtesy of a new post to the PlayStation Blog. "What a year it's been for PlayStation Studios," Spider-Man 2 creative director Bryan Intihar wrote as part of the news, "here at Insomniac Games we’ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers. Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022...and here’s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're in the mood for some entertainment that's both fun and free, you might like to point your browser in the direction of No Man's Sky studio Hello Games, which has just made the two mobile instalments of its very excellent arcade stunt racer series Joe Danger playable on the web for the grand total of zero pee.


More specifically, those with a hankering for some stuntery and a browser within arms reach can test their racing mettle in Joe Danger Touch and its follow-up Joe Danger Infinity, which were initially released on iOS in 2013 and 2014.


Both games, you might recall, unceremoniously vanished from the App Store in 2017, following Apple's decision to end support for 32-bit apps with iOS11. But in a lovely moment at the start of this year, they each received a surprise re-release. "It's always been a secret shame of ours that the success of No Man's Sky left Joe Danger unloved," Hello Games' Sean Murray explained at the time. "For the last two years we've had a hobby project of bringing Joe Danger back to life. Slowly rebuilding it piece by piece through eight years of Unity changes."

For fans looking to complete their amiibo collection, there's now an official release date for Final Fantasy 7's Sephiroth and Tekken's Kazuya Mishima.
Minecraft's Steve and Alex were the most recent amiibo to be released, after they were delayed to September earlier this year.

This free access will run until 19th December, and offers three maps and four modes to play through.


The maps in question are Shipment (a new arrival to the game - more on that in a second), Farm 18 (which is a Shoothouse inspired number) and El Asilo. Meanwhile, the four modes are Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed. These can be played in first and third-person.

In a new video, Shen revealed Starfield's faction quests will be more similar to those from Bethesda's Skyrim, in the sense that players will be able to experience each faction independently. This will not be a Fallout 4 situation, which saw players being locked out of factions after joining another (something that was a bone of contention among some members of the community).


"One of the early things we decided on was making sure that the main quest actually kind of gives you a little bit of a tour of the settled systems and all of the major players there so that we can give you a taste of what they're going to be up to," Shen explained.

<p>The idea was to bring together people from a variety of disciplines who are all thinking about different aspects of democracy, less from a &#8220;what we need to do today&#8221; perspective and more from a blue-sky future perspective. My remit to the participants was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea is to start from scratch, to pretend we’re forming a new country and don’t have any precedent to deal with. And that we don’t have any unique interests to perturb our thinking. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government mid-eighteenth century politicians technology could invent. The twenty-first century is a very different place technically, scientifically, and philosophically. What could democracy look like if it were reinvented today? Would it even be democracy­&#8212;what comes after democracy?...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Dynamic resource allocation is a new API for requesting resources. It is a
generalization of the persistent volumes API for generic resources, making it possible to:
access the same resource instance in different pods and containers,
attach arbitrary constraints to a resource request to get the exact resource
you are looking for,
initialize a resource according to parameters provided by the user.
Third-party resource drivers are responsible for interpreting these parameters
as well as tracking and allocating resources as requests come in.
Dynamic resource allocation is an alpha feature and only enabled when the
DynamicResourceAllocation feature
gate and the
resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group are enabled. For details, see the

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the show has been in development since March and will, notably, focus on Kratos' dad years in Midgard as per 2018's God of War reboot, rather than the ultra-violent Greek-mythology-inspired adventures of Kratos' earlier games.


Here's how the show's official description teases its plot: "When his beloved wife dies, Kratos sets off on a dangerous journey with his estranged son to spread her ashes from the highest peak - his wife's final wish. Kratos soon realises the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new gods and monsters for the fate of the world."

Announced as part of Private Division's fifth anniversary celebrations, the new project is said to be in "early development" for unnamed platforms. Further details are scant to the point of non-existent, but Bloober has confirmed we won't be seeing the fruits of its efforts for quite some time, with a launch not expected before 2025.


In a statement accompany today's announcement, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno referred to the unnamed project only as an "exciting new survival horror game", saying it "will help us become a leader in the horror industry at large".

Throughout the day, users have been taking to social media and to Steam's review section to make their feelings clear about the game's performance on their PC setups. Overall, the suggestion is the game is punishing on CPUs - even high-end ones - if you have ray-tracing switched on.

However, Hungarian digital artist Zsolt Kosa actually envisioned this collaboration much, much, earlier. Perhaps, even before developer CD Projekt Red did. 


Two years ago, Kosa shared two mocked up posters of Elba in Cyberpunk 2077 to his ArtStation page. The first of these shows Elba with ice blue cyber-eyes and an impressively collared coat (as shown in this article's header image). The second shows him with some rather fancy looking sunglasses, and that same very fetching coat.

Fly a helicopter past a skyscraper and you'll now see your ride reflected in its glass. Zoom along Los Santos' neon-drenched waterfront in your jet ski, and you'll be able to see its lights reflected in the waves. Neat!

The stakes are a little different when said assignment is, say, a £50 game from a best-selling, worldwide franchise. And unfortunately for someone at Square Enix, that assignment was Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion.
Shortly after the game's release yesterday, the eagle-eyed writers over at Kotaku noticed a Getty Images watermark on one of the in-game paintings.

Bypassing the launcher is not as simple as hitting uninstall - 2K clearly wants you to run its software as part of the game's startup. Still, the thread has a point-by-point list of instructions for those who do want to give it a go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Ubisoft's preferential treatment for the Epic Games Store continues to evaporate, yet another of the publisher's titles is making its way to Steam, with the reasonably well-recieved Watch Dogs Legion now pencilled in for a 23rd January release on Valve's platform.


This latest listings follows Ubisoft's announcement back in November that, having skipped Steam in favour of Epic and its own Ubisoft Connect since 2019, it would soon be bringing a select number of its games to Valve's storefront, starting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Anno 1800, and the free-to-play Roller Champions.


That initial line-up expanded by one last week with Immortals Fenyx Rising, and now Watch Dogs Legion's official January release brings Ubisoft's post-2019 Steam selection up to five.

This update will see players decking their halls with boughs of holly, thanks to a collection of new seasonal items that have been added to the game. This includes charming stockings, twinkling fairy lights, and even Santa's very own sleigh (which comes complete with its own reindeer team).


Meanwhile, thanks to the new Christmas tree additions, you could even say you will now be able to spruce your campus up a bit. After all, these decorations are tree-mendous (ok, I'll stop now).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How safe do you feel in your Valheim base? Walls secure, trenches dug out, windows sealed? Even with all these precautions in place, you may still not be safe from Valheim's new enemies. With the introduction of the Mistlands update comes a new type of raid - and this one is wreaking havoc on established player bases. Rather devastatingly, some players are losing homes that took them hundreds of hours to make. 


The new event, called "they sought you out", unleashes hordes of insects on your player base - and worse still, they can fly. Seekers and seeker soldiers are capable of hopping over ditches, then mulching stone walls like they're made of papier maché. The event can occur at any time after you've defeated the Plains boss Yagluth, so anyone who has completed Valheim's biomes is vulnerable to these attacks. And sure enough, it's taking a lot of players by surprise. 


"When we got raided we got caught off-guard and lost our three-story base which took us hundreds of hours," said one Reddit user. "It was protected with walls, trenches, and most upgraded gates - it didn't slow the seekers down at all... We all rage quit after surviving the raid, but after looking around at the aftermath, we realised any amount of rebuilding wouldn't matter because we lost seasonal item buffs for comfort level and we could not survive another raid like that."

On 7th December, Twitch announced it had added "tens of thousands" of new global charities to its charity tool for streamers. The feature was added in July in a US-only beta, and became available to all partners in August. Twitch and Paypal Giving Fund do not take a cut of donations raised through the charity tool.
"We added tens of thousands more Paypal-vetted charities from the US and dozens of different countries," Twitch stated in its blog announcement. The company came under fire from users when they discovered LGB Alliance, a UK-based hate group opposed to trans rights, was one of the new additions to Twitch's approved charities. The group was controversially granted charity status in April 2021 by the UK government.

Unlike other big PlayStation releases, it is recommended that you have a colossal 32GB of RAM available on your PC to play Returnal at its best potential. 


For comparison, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection and Horizon Zero Dawn both recommend having 16GB of RAM available - that is the minimum of what Returnal asks for. Meanwhile, God of War only asks for 8GB of RAM for the best PC experience.

<blockquote><p>As with any new technology, the development and deployment of ChatGPT is likely to have a significant impact on the field of cybersecurity. In many ways, ChatGPT and other AI technologies hold great promise for improving the ability of organizations and individuals to defend against cyber threats. At the same time, however, the use of these technologies also raises important questions and concerns about the potential risks and challenges they may pose...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The long-awaited day has arrived: HostProcess containers, the Windows equivalent to Linux privileged
containers, has finally made it to GA in Kubernetes 1.26!
What are HostProcess containers and why are they useful?
Cluster operators are often faced with the need to configure their nodes upon provisioning such as
installing Windows services, configuring registry keys, managing TLS certificates,
making network configuration changes, or even deploying monitoring tools such as a Prometheus's node-exporter.
Previously, performing these actions on Windows nodes was usually done by running PowerShell scripts

Once upon a time, this ensemble from Call of Duty eSports team LA Thieves basically allowed wearers to become one with the shadows thanks to its all-black design (bar a red embossed "LA" on the chest). However, it has now been given a colourful little update by Activision. So, yes, we will be able to see you now. 
As Ishraq reported earlier this month, this skin by LA Thieves was labelled  "Roze 2.0", which is a reference to the Roze skin that was released for the original Warzone and Modern Warfare back in 2019. This skin was notoriously famous for making its wearer hard to see. In fact, following its release, Raven Software was forced to edit the skin to make it easier for other players to see the elusive Roze skin wearers.

However, following this year's show, many couldn't help but notice that Microsoft's offerings seemed remarkably sparse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Canadian court has approved a class-action lawsuit against the creators of Fortnite, Epic Games.

We first reported that the Canadian legal firm was preparing a class-action lawsuit against Epic Games back in 2019. It accused the developer of "knowingly" creating the "very, very addictive game", Fortnite, but had been in limbo ever since as the court assessed whether or not the case could proceed.

Now, however, it seems the court agrees with the plaintiff that the claim "does not appear to be frivolous or manifestly ill-founded" and, according to CTV News, just because there's "no certainty" that Epic created an "addictive" game it "does not preclude the possibility that the game is in fact addictive and that its creator and distributor are presumed to know this".

In his acceptance speech for The 2022 Game Awards, during which Elden Ring secured the coveted Game of the Year award, Miyazaki said the win "really, really encourages" the team and thanked George R.R. Martin for his "great mythos for this game".

After thanking the "entire Elden Ring team members, everybody at From Software, our partner, Bandai Namco, all collaborators, and last but not least, Mr. George R.R. Martin", Miyazaki said:

Polygon reports that the lawsuit - filed in various countries right across the world, including the UK and Germany, due to varying copyright law - maintains free-to-play Hyper Front is "a copy of substantial parts of Valorant", including its "characters, maps, weapons, weapon skins, and charms".

Whilst player data for Hyper Front is currently unknown, Polygon points out that the Google Play Store says it has over a million downloads and almost 50,000 reviews. And whilst Hyper Front is currently unavailable in the US, where Riot is based, it is playable in many other territories where a mobile version of Valorant is currently in development and expected to release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's gradual tiptoe back onto Steam is set to continue, with the publisher's enjoyable 2020 action-adventure Immortals Fenyx Rising now confirmed as heading to Valve's platform.


Launched at the tail-end of 2020, Fenyx Rising followed the same pattern as all new Ubisoft PC releases since 2019, skipping Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12% revenue cut compared to Valve's 30%.


However, it appeared Ubisoft's position on its preferred storefronts was about to shift in November after listings for a Steam version of Assassin's Creed Valhalla were discovered, and the move was confirmed by the publisher itself in December, when Valhalla, Anno 1800, and Roller Champions were all announced to be heading to Valve's platform.

Sporting a gorgeous Ghibli-esque art style, Europa promises a "peaceful game of adventure, exploration, and meditation" on terraformed moon in Jupiter's shadow. Here, among lakes, meadows, mountains, and the remnants of a fallen civilisation, players - cast as an android called Zee - can run, glide, and fly across the landscape as they try to uncover the story of their creator.


Alongside an "intimate story about growing up and humanity's relationship with nature", Europa promises puzzles, secrets, and hidden dangers, with players able to gradually upgrade their Zephyr jetpack to boost higher and further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, it's the morning after the night before - and what a night. While The Game Awards 2022 dominated the news, Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover faced a major setback with the FTC and Diablo 4's big release date announcement was superseded by serious claims of mismanagement and crunch.  

The awards ceremony was an eventful affair, even without its climactic and rather concerning stage invasion. The typical array of trailers for games like Final Fantasy 16, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor and Street Fighter 6 came thick and fast, alongside big announcements for things such as Death Stranding 2, Hades 2, Horizon Forbidden West PS5-only DLC and Armored Core 6. 
Did Geoff Keighley keep his pledge to make this year's ceremony speedier? Not really. Somewhere, Christopher Judge is now on the second day of his acceptance speech. So, here for you today is a recap of everything we thought was really worth your time - and what we think Death Stranding 2 should actually be titled. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Wesley Yin-Poole.

Wild Hearts, a collaboration between Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series) and EA Originals, transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom's Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan.


This isn't Omega Force's first turn in the monster hunting genre, of course; it previously dabbled in its two Toukiden games, and Wild Hearts expands on those to introduce an experience where up to three players can seamlessly battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.

You can see it for yourself below.


So, yes, there is Elba in character (also, hey Keanu!). But just who exactly is that character? Let's Idris the Elba in the room...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8 got its moment in the sun at The Game Awards last night, and for fans of the long-running fighting game franchise like me, one thing stood out: Jun Kazama's return.


Jun Kazama, Jin's mother, made her debut in 1995's Tekken 2 and hasn't been a playable character in the mainline Tekken series since. 27 years later, she's back and it looks like she hasn't aged a day. Tekken time logic, I guess.


The trailer below focuses on the Tekken 8 story (Tekken has an actual real life Guinness World Record for being the longest-running video game storyline!). Once again the Mishimas are at each other's throats, with Tekken 8 picking up where Tekken 7 left off and the war between father and son Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama heating up. When all appears lost, Jin looks up and sees his mother's dramatic return. I doubt there's much interest in a family selfie.

Transformers: Reactivate was shown last night at The Game Awards 2022, with a fresh trailer you can see below. The project is being designed as an online action game for one to four players where you play as some of the franchise's most iconic characters. And yes, you can transform between a vehicle and a bot (obviously!)


The news comes alongside word that Splash Damage has acquired Bulkhead, the UK studio behind World War 2 shooter Battalion 1944, which is also working on Transformers: Reactivate.

Earlier this year, Belarusian-based developer Sad Cat Studio announced it was delaying Replaced's release into 2023 in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 


"The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families. As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced," the studio said in May.

Saber Interactive's hotly-anticipated (by me) sequel shows Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus stomp and shoot and generally smash to bits the xenos scum that is the Tyranids (they're the evil aliens, Tom).


The setup here is pretty simple: the Tyranids are devouring worlds (nom nom) and it's up to the Ultramarines to stem the tide. Cue big battles in which one man army Titus teaches the 'nids a lesson in brutality.

The online free-to-play role-player was previously announced for an early spring 2023 launch in Japan. Amazon is handling publishing duties for its wider launch, due in the second half of the year. 


Blue Protocol is described as a sci-fi fantasy adventure set on the war-torn planet of Regnas, following thousands of years of non-stop conflict. It's your job to restore balance, save the planet, and also explore its surface for side-quests and mini-games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a tease of a partnership earlier this year, Joe Madureira's Airship Syndicate studio and Warfare developer Digital Extremes have unveiled the former's new free-to-play online action-RPG, Wayfinder, coming to PC and consoles next year.


Set in the fractured fantasy world of Evenor, players take on the role of Wayfinders as they embark on a quest of "endless action and adventure" to restore their home from a foul, consuming force known as the Gloom.


Airship (which made Ruined King: A League of Legends Story and Darksiders Genesis) says each playable Wayfinder comes with its own unique story, play style, and abilities - which can be augmented by using Echoes from fallen foes - with players able to wield arcane magic, mystical tech, and "cunning" weapons as they embark on hunts and expeditions to new locations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 finally has a release date! It's only narrowed down to a month, rather than a day, but here it is: August 2023. Mark it in your calendars and take the whole month off. Say Eurogamer said it was okay.
The August 2023 release date means Baldur's Gate 3 arrives, in full, just shy of three years after it first appeared in Steam Early Access, in October 2022. A lot has happened there of course - a lot of tweaking and tuning and honing the experience of the game. Its popularity allowed Larian to breathe and make BG3 a bigger, better thing.
Just for giggles: the August 2023 date also means BG3 arrives 23 years after BG2, and 25 years after the original Baldur's Gate. I imagine you're probably not laughing if you remember those.

This news follows a tease earlier today from creator Hideo Kojima, that showed a blanked out visage with the words "How come?" written across it. Many guessed this face was that of Léa Seydoux, and they were right as she is very much front and centre of Death Stranding 2's (or DS2's) announcement trailer, which you can see below. 


Joining Seydoux are actors Norman Reedus (who previously let slip that the game was in development), Troy Baker, Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna. The game will be coming to PlayStation 5.

When a B.P.R.D. agent vanishes inside the mansion, it’s up to Hellboy and his team of agents to uncover its forbidden secrets."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new investigation into Diablo 4's development has painted a picture of chaos and mismanagement at Activision Blizzard, reportedly resulting in a dash to meet a release date - said to be 6th June next year - that staff believe is "unlikely" to be met without "many hours of overtime or cut features".


In a new report by The Washington Post, assembled after speaking with 15 current and former Blizzard employees, it's claimed Diablo 4's development was troubled from the off, with leadership at the time instilling the project with a "sense of inertia" as large parts of the game were constantly revamped and scrapped - including a planned battle royale mode.


Talking to The Washington Post, team members laid much of the early blame at director Luis Barriga and lead designer Jesse McCree, both of who left the studio in 2021, amid serious allegations of institutionalised discrimination and harassment at Activision Blizzard. Colleagues claim, for instance, McCree "would grow intrigued by different aspects of the game and then lose interest and hand it off to other people without finishing what he started."

"We continue to believe that this deal will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers," Microsoft's vice chair and president Brad Smith said in a statement. "We have been committed since Day One to addressing competition concerns, including by offering earlier this week proposed concessions to the FTC."


"While we believed in giving peace a chance," Smith concluded, "we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sifu's previously teased free autumn update is now here, adding a nifty replay editor to developer Sloclap's acclaimed martial arts adventure on PC and PlayStation.


There's more too, but the replay editor is undoubtedly the star of the show, giving players the tools to turn their favourite takedowns into cinematic mini-masterpieces. There are options to adjust camera placement, for instance, to define lens parameters, choreograph camera movement, and even add effects including slo-mo and speed-ups.


You can get a taste of the tools available in Sloclap's autumn update trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has launched a fresh legal front in its ongoing battle against the State of California, which has been suing the Call of Duty publisher over reports of workplace misconduct and sexual harassment since the summer of 2021. 


In response, Activision has now filed its own lawsuit against California's recently-renamed Civil Rights Department (CRD) - the same agency currently trying to sue Activision - over claims the department has taken too long with its own case and not been transparent over its connections with the media and labour unions (thanks, Axios). 


Activision is now asking a judge to force the CRD (previously the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, or DFEH) to produce various internal documents. These include details of the department's discussions with the Communication Workers of America, the union which has been repeatedly in the headlines this year for helping organise games industry QA staff (including several teams at Activision).

A tweet from PlayStation Japan, that has since been deleted, was spotted making the rounds earlier today. Its translation reveals that a demo for Forspoken will be announced on 9th December.


Meanwhile, over on the main PlayStation account, the team has a small reel promoting an 11-minute long Forspoken stream that promises to show off new gameplay.

We're promised a bumper show from The Game Awards tonight, with the inevitable Hideo Kojima-shaped announcement - Geoff can't let a show go by without a nod to his bessie - plus news on the likes of Street Fighter 5, Jedi Survivor and Diablo 4 and plenty more besides. And only a small amount of it has leaked ahead of time! 


The show kicks off at 12.30am, and while we're also promised a more compact running order than previous years I'd expect a runtime north of two hours. So do bring caffeine, and lots of it.

The channel, which frequently reports on trivia from a specific game or franchise, has been issued a takedown notice from Nintendo. This takedown pertains specifically to Did You Know Gaming's video on Heroes of Hyrule - a Zelda game for the Nintendo DS akin to Final Fantasy Tactics, that was pitched to Nintendo by Retro Studios.


In response to this notice, Did You Know Gaming stated it considers this move by Nintendo a "slap in the face for video game history preservation".

If you have got past this point, you'll likely remember the bizarre eight-minute scrolling text story which comes next, before the end credits begin proper. 


It's a truly odd read - structured as a conversation between two higher beings apparently observing you - the player. Perhaps even odder, it was never officially licensed to Minecraft developer Mojang, and subsequently is not owned by Microsoft.

Like his previous ones for Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna, this latest teaser shows a blanked out visage with some cryptic wording written across it (which, in this case, reads "How come?").

And Malindy wasn't alone in thinking this way. Even the powers that be at Sony reportedly didn't feel the game warranted a sequel. 


But, according to Days Gone director John Garvin, the game itself was not to blame for this tepid reception. Rather, it "failed" because of a combination of "tech issues", "reviewers who couldn't be bothered to actually play the game" and "woke reviewers who couldn't handle a gruff white biker looking at his date's ass." Errm, ok then.

No more! A new update to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch adds a custom item option and it's the best thing to happen to the game. 


Honestly I'm surprised it's taken Nintendo this long to implement. Yes, items are used to even out the skill levels of racers as well as increase the mayhem, but item customisation was included in Super Smash Bros years ago. Finally Mario Kart gets the same treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has solved its long-running supply issues for the PlayStation 5 - in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, anyway. 


The PS5 has proved hard to find ever since it arrived two years ago, with stock problems leading to shortages and scalping. 


PS5 availability has been a global issue, though one Sony now says it has solved in its home country. Speaking at the recent PlayStation Partner Awards event in Japan, company boss Jim Ryan said the console's ongoing supply problems had now finally been put to bed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lorry containing over £500k of Evercade EXP Limited Edition stock has been reported stolen, in what developer Blaze Entertainment has described as a "terrible, potentially organised attack". 


Exact details of the theft are unclear, though it's reported the incident took place as stock was being moved between warehouses. Nobody was injured, but all stock was taken.


The £130 gaming handhelds had been destined for despatch to customers in the UK and USA, and elsewhere in the world outside of Europe. A separate consignment bound for customers in mainland Europe is unaffected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is giving players the opportunity to try out the online multiplayer portion of its PlayStation Plus subscription service for free this weekend, starting on Saturday, 10th December.


That means anyone can put PlayStation 4 and 5's online multiplayer through its paces - teaming up with friends, strangers, or other non-specific entities across all multiplayer-supporting games - between 10th-11th December without needing to cough up the usual fee.


The requirements to particpate are fairly obvious: players will need to register a PSN account, will need an active internet connection, and will need access to a game that supports online play. Why not, for instance, give Elden Ring's new PvP-focused Colosseum update a try?

Resurgence (not to be confused with Heartland, Ubisoft's upcoming free-to-play Division game for PC and consoles), will, like other titles in the series, be an open-world third-person shooter RPG set in post-crisis America - specifically, Manhattan - following a deadly virus outbreak.


Ubisoft's previous chatter around Resurgence has promised a fresh story campaign offering a "new perspective on key story events" from past The Division games, with players once again being cast as agents allied to the Strategic Homeland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary game designer Jeff Minter and his Llamasoft outfit is back with another blast of psychedelic shooter action, this time in the form of Akka Arrh - a "reimagining" of an '80s arcade cabinet game that never actually released.


This, of course, is a somewhat different scenario to Minter's Polybius, which was inspired by an '80s arcade cabinet game that never actually existed. Akka Arrh, though, is very much a thing, having been designed by Atari's Mike Hally and Dave Ralston as a prototype back in 1982.


Minter's reimagining of Akka Arrh - of which only three cabinets are still said to exist - has been created in partnership with Atari, and promises "a cascade of words, colour, shapes and sound [flowing] around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Delightful VR fantasy adventure Moss and its sequel have been confirmed as PSVR2 launch titles, with both games arriving alongside Sony's new hardware on 22nd February next year.


The original Moss, if you're unfamiliar, initially launched as a PSVR exclusive back in 2018, gaining widespread acclaim for its charming tale of a tiny mouse, Quill, on a journey through a beautiful, human-sized fantasy world. Eurogamer called it "the finest PSVR game to date".


Its best trick was its hybrid first-person/-third-person perspective, giving players full control over Quill while simultaneously letting them view the action through the eyes of a spirit, able to interact with the environment to solve puzzles and help Quill on her journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to the early 90s and you may recall two aliens with a love for funk music crash landing on earth. These aliens were ToeJam and Earl, and their initial crash landing here (all via the Sega Mega Drive) resulted in their names being elevated to somewhat of a cult status in the industry. 


Now, over 30 years since their first landing, ToeJam and Earl will soon be coming to a new medium. Yes, these two aliens will be joining the likes of Lara Croft, Nathan Drake and Mario, who have all made the transition to the big screen. 


Per The Hollywood Reporter, a new feature film from Amazon based on ToeJam and Earl's video game escapades will be heading our way sometime in the future. This upcoming project will be written by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo, whose previous work includes Hotel Transylvania 4. Meanwhile, basketball player Stephen Curry will also be producing the project through his production company Unanimous Media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No blue shells? ALL BLUE SHELLS? Beautiful, perpetual chaos can now be yours whenever you desire, thanks to a free new Mario Kart 8 Deluxe update enabling players to define exactly which items they want to appear in their games.


As detailed in Nintendo's announcement tweet, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's new custom item feature works with offline VS races, as well as "certain" online modes, and gives players the ability to either randomise items that'll be available in their races or to toggle specific items on or off. And yes, that means competitions can now be entirely item-free.


That's not quite the end of it, either; in Team Races and Battles, it's even possible to allocate items to specific teams, meaning you can really pile on the pressure - perhaps all spiny shells against an increasingly sweaty palmed team armed with nothing but hooters?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Sonic the Hedgehog and Genshin Impact are fighting over various claims of foul play in relation to this year's Players' Voice fan vote at tomorrow's Game Awards.


The Players' Voice category is a 100 percent fan-voted award which this year has five possible choices as its finalists: Elden Ring, Genshin Impact, Stray, God of War Ragnarok and Sonic Frontiers. Over the past week, the vote has become mired in controversy amidst accusations of a broken poll, bots and bribery.


To be clear, there's no credible evidence of bribery, despite various fan claims foul play must be to blame for both Sonic (with a lower Metacritic score than other entrants) and Genshin Impact (whose detractors point out was first released in 2020) being way-off in the lead.

As part of this announcement, Spencer stated "Microsoft is committed to helping bring more games to more people - however they choose to play."


So, how do people choose to play Call of Duty? Well, for this current generation of consoles at least, not on a Nintendo Switch. There simply just isn't the option to do so.

<blockquote><p>The idea is simple, yet previously not clearly articulated: to ensure privacy, information should be divided architecturally and institutionally such that each entity has only the information they need to perform their relevant function. Architectural decoupling entails splitting functionality for different fundamental actions in a system, such as decoupling authentication (proving who is allowed to use the network) from connectivity (establishing session state for communicating). Institutional decoupling entails splitting what information remains between non-colluding entities, such as distinct companies or network operators, or between a user and network peers. This decoupling makes service providers individually breach-proof, as they each have little or no sensitive data that can be lost to hackers. Put simply, the Decoupling Principle suggests always separating who you are from what you do...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Japanese newspaper Asahi reported today that Naka now stands accused of violating financial laws in relation to another mobile game it is claimed he had insider knowledge of - Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier.


Specifically, Naka is accused of purchasing 144.7m yen's worth of shares in its developer ATeam (worth around £865k) before The First Soldier was officially announced.

Pickford was asked what he was getting up to during his downtime - and, amongst other things, eventually revealed he was still hooked to Fortnite. (And no wonder - its freshly-minted Chapter 4 has reinvented the game.)

Xbox boss Phil Spencer tweeted the announcement, which also confirms the company's commitment to continue to release Call of Duty games on Valve's Steam platform "simultaneously to Xbox", if the gargantuan $69 billion offer to buy Activision Blizzard is approved. Call of Duty's latest releases, Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, are already on Steam.


The announcement is a direct response to the scrutiny the acquisition has come under from a raft of organisations across the world, chief among them the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years since its initial unveiling and multiple delays later, Dead Island 2 is finally almost upon us - and ahead of its launch next April, publisher Deep Silver has shared more of its open-world, zombie-pulverising antics in a new digital showcase.


Those with itchy fast-forward fingers will be pleased to know the vast majority of Dead Island 2's 15-minute showcase is taken up by largely uninformative live-action sequences, featuring a group of zombie apocalypse survivors as they stumble across a copy of Dead Island 2 in a fancy LA mansion. It's entirely inessential fluff, but, tucked between all that, Deep Silver does manage to squeeze in a few minutes of gameplay.


Admittedly, there's little that's particularly revelatory in there - the publisher basically just used the time to reiterate the obvious fact you'll mostly be maiming various zombie types gruesomely until they're dead - but it did give us a decent new look at Dead Island 2's appealingly sun-kissed gore, as well as a taste of its weapon roster, including hammers, machetes, bear claws, a "shit-tonne of guns", and various makeshift tools of destruction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite has released its December update, bringing with it the earlier-than-anticipated arrival of a custom game browser, an updated version of Halo 3's The Pit map, and more.


Halo Infinite's new custom game browser is designed to work in tandem with the Forge Beta introduced as part of November's Winter Update. It was originally planned for release as part of next year's Season 3, but as developer 343 Industries explains in its blog post, "We fully agree with players who felt [it] should be a priority — it's a key support structure for what players create in Forge and a pillar for the community." 343 says this initial V1 release is "likely to have some rough edges" but will continue to evolve over time.


Elsewhere, today's update introduces Empyrean, a "reimagining" of Halo 3's The Pit map that's been officially rebuilt in Forge by 343. "How do Halo Infinite's toys, like its limited-use Equipment, alter some of those dynamics and affect how you traverse the combat dance floor?," the developer asks in its introduction. "Maybe the enemy team managed to grab the rockets first, but you went and acquired the Repulsor to protect yourself... We can't wait to see what new memories are forged in this proving ground!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hindsight, the acclaimed narrative adventure from developer Joel MacDonald and publisher Annapurna Interactive - in which players experience a woman's entire life, from birth to the present day - is now available on Xbox One and PlayStation. 


Hindsight is the follow-up McDonald's acclaimed iOS botanical puzzler Prune (McDonald is also a former Call of Duty designer) and tells the story of a woman revisiting her childhood home following her mother's death. As she sorts through her old belongings, she unlocks old memories that players can experience first-hand in the form of dioramas.


"Hindsight asks you to slow down and pay attention to the little things left behind," explains the game's official blurb. "Piece these things together and shift your viewpoint until you find just the right perspective to pull you deeper into the past... Linger as long as you wish, but sooner or later you must come back to the present."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors, the acclaimed minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is getting its first dollop of paid DLC next week in the form of Legacy of the Moonspell, arriving next Thursday, 15th December, on Xbox and PC.


"In eastern lands, a clan has fallen," explains Poncle in its DLC announcement post. "The Moonspell, once vigilant guardians of a sorcerous valley nestled in the mountains, have been overrun by hordes of yokai and oni. Though treacherous, this hive of spectral activity may provide some clue as to the location of a vampire. If not, at least it'll be entertaining to defeat thousands of wayward spirits in the process."


More specifically, Legacy of the Moonspell introduces eight new characters - including Miang Moonspell, Menya Moonspell, Syuuto Moonspell, and Babi-Onna - plus new monsters, six new music tracks, and a "huge" new stage incorporating the likes of an abandoned castle, yokai-infested village, and snow-covered mountain.

The concept, dubbed Metroid Tactics, was the brainchild of Metroid Prime developer Paul Tozer. The idea was one of several pitched following the conclusion of Retro's Metroid Prime trilogy - and another which was ultimately turned down. 


Tozer discussed the pitch publicly for the first time this week in a new Did You Know Gaming video which details the game's planned setting and storyline as a prequel to the entire Metroid series.

The emote, named "Tidy", allows your character to dance like Snoop Dogg in his 2004 song Drop It Like It's Hot. It's one of a handful of emotes from Fortnite's early days thought to use unlicensed dance moves - other examples of which sparked largely-unsuccessful legal threats from individuals keen to take Epic Games to court. 


Fans were surprised to see the emote return upon the Item Shop's midnight UK time refresh - though its appearance was shortlived, and it was pulled from sale just a couple of hours later.

The game's final 72 cards will release next year in three expansions, set to launch in April, July and September 2023. After this time, CD Projekt will transition from its own monthly balance changes to a system voted on by players. 


Dubbed as "Project Gwenfinity", the idea is that Gwent can be left to just a skeleton crew within CD Projekt to keep an eye on, while the game's community decides on tweaks to exisiting cards to keep up with the current meta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's big Disney Dreamlight Valley does more than add content themed around Toy Story and Lilo and Stitch - it also brings some welcome performance improvements, tweaks and bug fixes. 


Patch notes promise "optimised game stability on all platforms" but for Nintendo Switch in particular, where developer Gameloft has put a "considerable focus" this time around. 


The popular Disney life sim is now fully compatible with Steam Deck and verified by Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[300 quality assurance staff members at Zenimax, the holding company for the likes of Bethesda Softworks, Arkane Studios, and id Software, have unionised with the Communications Workers of America. 


Following a four-week election process, should the majority of workers support unionisation, Microsoft, who purchased Zenimax for $7.5bn in 2021, will recognise the union. 


The company has also pledged to remain neutral throughout this process. "We applaud Microsoft for remaining neutral through this process and letting workers decide for themselves whether they want a union," said CWA president Christopher Shelton.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has formally confirmed its offer of a 10-year contract to keep releasing Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms after its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


In an opinion article on the deal published in the Wall St Journal,  Microsoft president Brad Smith committed to making its 10-year COD contract "legally enforceable by regulators in the US, UK and European Union" - territories in which the company was previously felt to be struggling to get its acquisition agreed without making some sort of concessions.


The majority of the opinion piece repeats the same arguments for the deal we've heard from Microsoft many times before - that it would be good for both consumers and game developers, and that Microsoft is still struggling in a sector where it is "stuck behind Sony's dominant PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch".

This includes the biggest hitters from Microsoft's first-party line-up for 2023, such as Bethesda's Starfield, Arkane's Redfall and the company's own Forza Motorsport reboot.


Of course, as is standard on Xbox, all of these will continue to be made available on day one as part of Xbox Game Pass. There's no suggestion today of any other pricing being changed - such as for that subscription service, or for Xbox hardware.

Simply put, the game's rocky 2020 launch changed the studio's plans. CD Projekt Red had to prioritise fixing the single-player experience, and multiplayer suffered as a result.
"We really needed to look at what were the priorities for Cyberpunk [after it launched]," Philipp Weber told me when I visited the studio last week. Weber was senior quest designer and coordinator on Cyberpunk 2077. Today, he's acting narrative director of the new Witcher game codenamed Polaris.

Now, Netflix is doing what it can to reassure fans that, while this will clearly be a change for the series, it will also bring a "different energy" to the show that the producers are excited about.

Speaking at The Witcher: Blood Origin's UK junket, showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich addressed the series' recasting with a variety of outlets.

The announcement of Cyberpunk 2077's Game of the Year Edition package has raised some eyebrows considering the game's state in the year that it launched, though the "GOTY Edition" branding has now been so over-used it should hardly come as a surprise.

The company will now work with "outside advisors to form a temporary interim management committee" as players quit the company's events in their dozens.


It follows a week of bad press for Bunney and his company, as it emerged Nintendo was shutting down a fan-run Smash Bros. tournament and continuing to partner with Panda.

Previously, the FTC's involvement in the deal had signalled a headache for Microsoft, which is facing regulatory approval around the world, and close scrutiny here in the UK. A lawsuit looked imminent - potentially blocking the acquisition, or carving out major concessions.


However, a fresh report by the New York Post into the FTC panel set to decide the deal's fate suggests the trade body is now looking more likely to let it pass.

Forensic container checkpointing is based on Checkpoint/Restore In
Userspace (CRIU) and allows the creation of stateful copies
of a running container without the container knowing that it is being
checkpointed. The copy of the container can be analyzed and restored in a

of it. Forensic container checkpointing was introduced as an alpha feature in
Kubernetes v1.25.
How does it work?
With the help of CRIU it is possible to checkpoint and restore containers.

Last night, Fortnite ditched its third map with shocking speed, as the game's ever-changing Island was quickly consumed by the invading Chrome in a brief cutscene. Then followed an extended 30-minute event mode where players were tasked with reforging the Island anew, using a mix of familiar and fresh locales that look set to appear in Chapter 4.

Cross-play was initially announced during Digital Extremes' TennoCon fan event in July 2021, with the developer saying it hoped to launch the feature before the end of that year. It obviously missed that target and then some, but, 12 months later, cross-play is finally here.


"Warframe will always be a game best played and enjoyed with friends and that's why launching Cross Platform Play is such an incredible moment for us," Digital Extremes' chief operating officer Sheldon Carter said in a statement announcing the news. "Together with our partners, we have broken down the walls that have prevented our players from experiencing the thrill of Warframe as one united community."
