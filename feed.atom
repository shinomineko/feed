<blockquote><p>Since September 2021, officers have investigated five incidents where suspects have placed small tracking devices on high-end vehicles so they can later locate and steal them. Brand name &#8220;air tags&#8221; are placed in out-of-sight areas of the target vehicles when they are parked in public places like malls or parking lots. Thieves then track the targeted vehicles to the victim’s residence, where they are stolen from the driveway.</p>
<p>Thieves typically use tools like screwdrivers to enter the vehicles through the driver or passenger door, while ensuring not to set off alarms. Once inside, an electronic device, typically used by mechanics to reprogram the factory setting, is connected to the onboard diagnostics port below the dashboard and programs the vehicle to accept a key the thieves have brought with them. Once the new key is programmed, the vehicle will start and the thieves drive it away...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you weren't aware just yet, Gran Turismo 7 is all about delivering more of a classical Gran Turismo experience, after the more experimental multiplayer-focussed Gran Turismo Sport. Which probably explains why our best look at the game in action to date comes via the reveal of classic circuit Deep Forest, which PlayStation just served up a full in-game onboard playthrough. 
The fictional Deep Forest circuit made its debut alongside the Gran Turismo series way back in 1997, and has been a fan favourite ever since. Its appearance in Gran Turismo 7 is, perhaps unsurprisingly, its most impressive yet, and the lap onboard a GT Lamborghini shows a track that's at once visually outstanding while also being remarkably faithful to the PS1 original.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A limited-edition Halo Infinite promotion that bundles a Master Chief-themed LA Lakers jersey, a matching Xbox wireless controller, and a Master Chief figurine is selling online for hundreds of dollars above its recommended retail price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite has pulled off its latest live event - typically spectacular in scope, technically ambitious in scale, and hugely important to the game's ongoing story. Tonight's The End event closed the book on its Chapter 2 map forever - and gave players a glimpse at what's next.
The End event began at the small fort built over the past week by Pleasant Park and, as players arrived, they were greeted by the welcome sight of the friendly Blue Cube teleporting into the location too. It was here players would make their last stand against the Cube Queen, head of the alien race which has now plagued Fortnite's reality for several seasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usually, the first step after purchasing an expensive bit of portable consumer electronics (apart from turning it on and going "woo", of course) is to find some sort of case to put it in. Ordinarily this is the point where I just cram my new purchase into a sock with a resigned sigh and have done with it, but Valve has you covered as far as Steam Deck goes, and has offered a look at the cute little carry case all units of its handheld gaming PC will ship with.

As detailed by Reddit user the_andshrew on the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, the new Matrix...thing was discovered listed in the PSN backend, where it was accompanied by an extremely minimal amount of useful information - primarily a couple of database entry numbers, an associated image, and word that it'll be coming to PS5.

However, there's finally light at the end of the long, long tunnel in that it's now expected to arrive "early" in 2022.
Stanley Parable's Ultra Deluxe Edition was first announced back in 2018, with an anticipated launch of 2019. That, obviously, never came to pass, nor did it do so the following year or, as developers Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows have now revealed, will it do so the year after that. "Hopefully when we all reconvene this time next year for our latest Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe Edition update," I wrote after the game's 2020 delay, "it'll be to discuss how awesome this fully released thing is, and not to bow our heads as it's jettisoned into the following year."

Zampella revealed EA's plans to create a multiple-game "connected Battlefield universe" in an interview with GameSpot, explaining it would feature an interconnected world with shared characters and stories, and "the player at the center". The aim of the move, Zampella claimed, is to "grow Battlefield and meet players where they play through various experiences and business models", including the upcoming Battlefield Mobile.

The Kubernetes release train rolls on, and we look ahead to the release of 1.23 next week. As is our tradition, I'm pleased to bring you a look back at the process that brought us the previous version.
The release team for 1.22 was led by Savitha Raghunathan, who was, at the time, a Senior Platform Engineer at MathWorks. I spoke to Savitha on the Kubernetes Podcast from Google, the weekly* show covering the Kubernetes and Cloud Native ecosystem.
Our release conversations shine a light on the team that puts together each Kubernetes release. Make sure you subscribe, wherever you get your podcasts so you catch the story of 1.23.
And in case you're interested in why the show has been on a hiatus the last few weeks, all will be revealed in the next episode!

Kubernetes v1.22, released in August 2021, introduced a new alpha feature that improves how Linux nodes implement memory resource requests and limits.

Since its arrival on Switch back in March, Capcom has released a steady flow of post-launch content for Monster Hunter Rise, ranging from the big stuff - which is to say new creatures and a proper conclusion to the Kamura Village story arc - to fun smaller additions, including a series of 'collaborations' based on various video game properties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox boss Phil Spencer has written to staff saying he is "evaluating all aspects" of Xbox's relationship with Activision Blizzard in light of a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming Activision CEO Bobby Kotick had known about alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment within his company for years, but had failed to fully act upon them.
In an email seen by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier - and later confirmed by Microsoft in a statement to IGN - Spencer told Xbox employees he and the gaming leadership team were "disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions" at Activision Blizzard, and that "this type of behaviour has no place in our industry".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ninja Theory's acclaimed 2017 action-adventure, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, has just received a new update, bringing August's Xbox Series X enhancements over to PC. Additionally, a range of new accessibility features have been introduced to both versions.
The official description for Hellblade's PC enhancements is a little vague, with Ninja Theory only promising "enriched visuals", alongside DirectX Raytracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and AMD FSR support. However, the new PC release will almost certainly reflect the Xbox Series X version, which introduced the likes of upgraded materials, particles, and draw distances.

Its arrival date has been revised to 8th February, a few weeks earlier than its originally anticipated 22nd February release.
Announcing the revised launch, Absolver explained it wanted to get Sifu into players hands a little sooner so they "can enjoy playing [it] ahead of an incredibly big month for highly anticipated AAA releases". If Sifu had stuck to its original release date it would have been jostling up against the likes of Destiny 2's The Witch Queen expansion, Horizon: Forbidden West, and the mighty Elden Ring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Mojang has announced that the long-awaited second part of Minecraft's ambitious Caves & Cliffs update will finally launch on 30th November for the Java and Bedrock editions of the game - meaning it'll be coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4,  Switch, iOS, Android, Windows 10, Windows 11, MacOS, and Linux.
Minecraft's Caves & Cliffs update, you may recall, was initially unveiled during last October's Minecon, with Mojang promising the likes of new cave types - complete with fresh blocks, mobs, and items - underground lakes and waterfalls to raft down, a new archaeology system, and, above ground, significantly more mountainous cliffs, complete with goats.

Inspired by Steve Purcell's cult comic series and first released in 2007, Beyond Time and Space once against follows the largely ludicrous adventures of crime-fighting dog and bunny duo Sam & Max - who both made their video game debut 15 years earlier in LucasArts' point-and-click classic Sam & Max Hit the Road - over the course of five episodes.

Eligible users should look for the cloud icon on supported titles in their console's Game Pass catalogue. If present, a cloud version of the game can be launched for immediate play - perhaps to sample its wares or to quickly join a friend's gaming session - without needing to download it first. Microsoft calls it a "great way to discover your next favourite game while saving space on your hard drive for the games you plan to play again and again."

After the mark is convinced, the scammer will have them get cash (sometimes out of investment or retirement accounts), and head to an ATM that sells cryptocurrencies and supports reading QR codes. Once the victim’s there, they’ll scan a QR code that the scammer sent them, which will tell the machine to send any crypto purchased to the scammer’s address.

<pre><code>:s^Twd.J;3hzg=Q~

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battlefield is used to a bit of chaos - it's at the series' core, after all, with manic moments in its sandbox what makes it stand out from other shooters - but the disarray of Battlefield 2042's first weekend in the wilds has been hugely frustrating. Since Battlefield 2042 went live on Friday, I've endured hard crashes, server problems and whole nights where the whole thing is simply unplayable. This is another Battlefield that's launching in a sorry state, and it's up there with Battlefield 4's infamously sorry start. From my own experience on Xbox Series X, it's considerably worse. 
A lot of that frustration stems from setting aside Friday night to get stuck into DICE's new shooter only to spend the whole evening butting up against a data persistent error that was, shall we say, persistent - across a whole night it was impossible to get into a single match of the All-Out Warfare that's the core of this new Battlefield experience, and only the classic matches and rulesets of Portal offered any joy.

It was fab and much-missed, and if a new report is to be believed, is now "definitely" set to make a a comeback.
That's according to journalist (and reliable rumour-smith) Jeff Grubb, who discussed a new in-development take on 1 vs 100 as part of his Giant Bomb show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As one of Bethesda's biggest and most beloved series, it's not much of a revelation to hear the company is already mulling over a new Fallout instalment, but studio director Todd Howard has now talked a little about a potential new series entry, confirming that while an idea exists, Fallout 5 is still a long way off.
Speaking to IGN as part of a Skyrim 10th anniversary retrospective, Howard explained that currently the studio has a "one-pager" for Fallout 5, outlining what it wants to do with the series. However, sci-fi adventure Starfield, due to release next year, and The Elder Scrolls 6 - which was still in its design phase as of June this year - remain the studio's priority, meaning it could be years before work on the next Fallout begins in earnest.

The user/group ID related security settings in Pod's securityContext trigger a problem when users want to
