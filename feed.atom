        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Employees at Destiny 2 developer Bungie have said they feel anxious about their current status at the company, following layoffs earlier this year.


As you may recall, layoffs were first reported at the developer in October. At this time, studio CEO Pete Parsons publicly commented on the cuts, calling it "a sad day". Around 100 employees were said to be affected.


Now, in a new report by IGN, many remaining at the company have said the studio is implementing a variety of other cost-cutting measures across the board, in order to remain an independent subsidiary within Sony (which acquired the developer in 2022). There is concern among staff that Bungie may lose its independence within Sony should Destiny 2 fail to meet financial goals.

However, this particular update has gone down rather badly with Skyrimmers, as it has reintroduced a paid mod platform into the game. 
To get you up to speed as to why this has been controversial, all the way back in 2015, Bethesda partnered with Valve to bring paid mods to Skyrim via Steam. However, it was incredibly unpopular with both players and mod makers, and the publisher removed the option to sell Skyrim mods on Valve's platform shortly after this idea made its debut.

The mod, called Ser Aylin (no longer available on Nexus Mods but a version has been archived on Wayback Machine), targets Dame Aylin and turns her into a "fully immersive male version" of herself by changing her model, using AI to alter the voice performance of actor Helen Keeley, and changing NPC dialogue lines.
Following Ser Aylin's upload by user Yedlike to Nexus Mods on 3rd December, Baldur's Gate 3 fans protested against the mod and asked others to not support it, noting it's part of a larger mod pack called No Alphabets. On 4th December, Nexus banned Yedlike for violating its community rules.

The accumulative playtime across all players is 452,556,984 hours, which is about 51,662 years. By contrast, 8196 of those years were spent in the character creator, accounting for 15.9 percent of all playtime.
1.3m players have finished the game's campaign at least once since Baldur's Gate 3 first released fully in August. If you're curious like me, you may be wondering what percentage of players this represents. While Larian hasn't specified sales numbers for the game, in August Larian CEO Sven Vincke told Bloomberg it had sold 2.5m copies on Steam during early access.

In a blog update, studio director Trent Kusters called this a "devastating position" for the team to find themselves in. 


"Though our commitment to our beloved starship adventure sim is unwavering, rapidly rising operation costs, a worsening AUD/USD exchange rate, poor Early Access sales, and the unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities across the industry, have placed us in a position where, as it currently stands, we are unable to sustain the cost of operations through to the release of v1.0, which was planned for Q2 of 2024," Kusters wrote.

As noted by developer Ubisoft, players will need to install a day one patch, which is "mandatory" to start playing the game. This means a one-time internet connection is required. An internet connection is also required for co-op gameplay. 

Once this patch is installed, however, those looking to head through Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora solo will be able to do so offline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lamplighters League might have officially flopped according to publisher Paradox Interactive, but that hasn't stopped developer Harebrained Schemes from making improvements to its pulp strategy adventure since its arrival - and its latest free update is perhaps its biggest yet, adding a new playable character and new events system.


The Lamplighters League, which launched to a mix reception back in October, blends tactical turn-based action and real-time stealth in a globe-trotting adventure inspired by the classic pulp stories of the 1930s, putting players in control of a disparate group of rogues as they attempt to thwart an occult-obsessed cabal known as the Banished Court.


And as of today, with the launch of The Lamplighters League's 1.3 update, the number of available playable rogues has swelled by one thanks to the arrival of Isaac Greymoor. Described as a "hot-headed, lead-slinging mercenary who wields a deadly light machine gun to devastating effect", Isaac is the sun of former Lamplighters League leader Lord Greymoor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wes Ball, the director of Nintendo's upcoming The Legend of Zelda movie, has discussed some of his ambitions for the project, saying he "would love to see a live-action Miyazaki" - a reference to legendary Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki, whose animated work includes Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Laputa: Castle in the Sky.


Ball, who has previously helmed the three Maze Runner films and is currently working on next year's King of the Planet of the Apes, was announced as the director of Nintendo's live-action The Legend of Zelda movie last month, as part of the project's official unveiling.


And now, speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Ball has shared a little of his vision for the Zelda film, describing it as "this awesome fantasy-adventure movie that isn't like Lord of the Rings, it's its own thing. I've always said, I would love to see a live-action Miyazaki. That wonder and whimsy that he brings to things, I would love to see something like that."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, the acclaimed interactive history of Atari from developer Digital Eclipse, has just added 12 more retro games as part of a free Holiday Content Update.


Atari 50, if you're unfamiliar, released at the tail-end of last year, drawing immediate acclaim for its wonderfully rich delve into Atari's 50-year history, mixing extensive interviews with designers, developers, and other prominent industry figures with archival content include documentary footage, design documents, and original artwork.


That in itself is an absolute treat, but Atari 50 also includes more than 90 playable arcade and console games from the company's illustrious, industry defining back catalogue, ranging from Pong and Breakout to the likes of Asteroids, Adventure, and more. It even features a number of previously unreleased titles, including Akka Arrh - which received an acclaimed reimagining from legendary developer Jeff Minter earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the first ever trailer for GTA 6 which was finally released following a tease from Rockstar, after the trailer leaked online ahead of schedule. 
That means we've got a look at the game's two protagonists, its modern day Vice City setting, and the general vibe of the game's story. We also know it's set for release in 2025 across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, with no news yet of a PC release. 
So what did we make of the trailer and the news? What are we hoping to see in GTA 6? And what's the future of GTA Online? Tom's away, so this week's podcast is hosted by me. I'm joined as ever by Eurogamer's Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan, as well as GTA Online expert Marie Pritchard from the Eurogamer guides team.

Bethesda is somewhat infamous for releasing some rather buggy games. These bugs are often amusing, and, in an odd way, an almost endearing feature that fans have come to expect with each release. 


But, despite them being a common Bethesda occurrence, the first season of Fallout will not include any playful references towards these unintentional video game issues, showrunners have now confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first season for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is set to arrive tomorrow, 6th December, across platforms. This will see a variety of in-game content added, including new Warzone map Urzikstan. This map will launch with 100 player count and, as noted by CharlieIntel, it is 20 percent smaller than the series' Al Mazrah map.


This has led some players to lament the comparatively condensed player numbers for each match. Typically, Warzone hosts 150-player lobbies.  However, developer Raven Software explained its decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating it will ensure a good gameplay balance.


"This morning we announced that the player count for Warzone Battle Royale is 100 players," reads the statement. "Our top priority is creating an optimal and fun experience for all of our players based on critical metrics.

It's almost impossible to go online these days without being smacked in the face by at least half a dozen purported GTA 6 "leaks", but this one was more plausible than most, which is probably why it gained traction. Quickly.

Its predecessor, WWE 2K23, was officially announced in January 2023, and released swiftly thereafter in March of that same year, leading some pundits to suggest that a similar timescale could apply here, too.

Whilst it's unlikely to come as a shock that the sequel was on the way, the rating board has seemingly confirmed the game's existence ahead of 2K's own marketing schedule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's taken five and a half years of asking from the community, but Sea of Thieves' oft-requested private servers are almost here, with Rare now confirming the feature will arrive as part of the multiplayer pirate adventure's third major Season 10 update on Thursday, 7th December.


Private servers will be available under the new banner of Safer Seas mode, which'll co-exist alongside the current shared world experience - officially renamed High Seas. Safer Seas enables up to four friends to crew a ship across a private version of the world and access all PvE content - ranging from emergent events to Trading Company quests and narrative-driven Tall Tales - without needing to deal with other crews.


It is, then, pretty much exactly what people have been asking for since Sea of Thieves' launch back in 2018, albeit with a number of restrictions. Features including Guilds, Hourglass Factions, and live-service events such as Gold & Glory are all unavailable, and Rare is capping Trading Company progression at 40 in Safer Seas, meaning it won't be possible to reach Pirate Legend status without returning to High Seas mode. Additionally, gold or reputation for Athena's Fortune or their Reaper's Bones counterpart won't be earnable.

        <updated>2023-12-01T22:45:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to Cyberpunk 2077's E3 2018 trailer and you might remember Night City's metro system playing a prominent role - which was why its absence as a fully functional transportation service was so notable come the game's beleagured release in December 2020. Three years later though, CD Projekt has announced it's restoring the long-missing rideable metro system in a surprise 2.1 update arriving next Tuesday, 5th December.


The 2.1 update coincides with the launch of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition (bundling together the base game and Phantom Liberty expansion) and was detailed in a new developer livestream, beginning with that long-awaited Metro system. "The metro was not in our plans for a long time," producer Monika Janowska explained during the presentation. "However, over time we've revisited our plan and... decided that it actually could be achievable."


Night City's metro system, officially known as Night City Area Rapid Transit and described as an "immersive way to travel through the world", consists of five lines spanning 19 stations. It unlocks after Cyberpunk's Konpeki Plaza sequence relatively early on and can either be used as fast travel locations (as was the case prior to 2.1) or "as a proper metro ride experience" for those who'd like to take in the sights in a more leisurely fashion.

Just over two years after launch, a fresh reveal for Halo Infinite will apparently arrive on Monday, 4th December at 5pm UK time.


The announcement was made this evening by Microsoft via a post on X, formerly Twitter, made to look like Rockstar's GTA 6 trailer post from this afternoon. The accompanying image shows the softly-lit silhouette of a Halo ring (rather than palm trees and seagulls).

As shared by RebsGaming, the first season of Halo is now available in full as a playlist on YouTube (although, it is only available in certain regions). Included in its description were the words: "catch up before the new season streaming Feb 8th."

The driving survival game was initially set to release this year, but developer Ironwood Studios made the decision to delay its launch in order to prioritise the team's health and wellbeing. 

"It's so exciting to know that in a few short months, you'll all be out on your own adventures in the Olympic Exclusion Zone," the developer said while annoucing Pacific Drive's new release date. "For those of you who have been waiting for this news, we thank you for your patience and sticking with us! Everyone at Ironwood has been working hard to finish the game and it’s been a long road (pun intended) to get here."

Epic Games' battle royale is then expected to reboot itself with an all-new Island when it returns online, and a fresh battle pass for Chapter 5: Season 1 that features a tiger-human hybrid, Snake and the long-awaited Peter Griffin.

        <updated>2023-11-30T21:05:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mercenary class has been unveiled for Path of Exile 2, and notably, it brings a whole new style of play to the game: shooter gameplay. It doesn't mean the game has suddenly gone first-person, but it does mean optional - and fluidly interchangeable - WASD movement is coming to the series for the first time. And that you can now move slightly while attacking. 
The Mercenary revolves around the crossbow weapon they carry, which behaves - depending on the type of crossbow - like either a shotgun, an assault rifle, or a sniper rifle. You can carry two kinds of crossbow at the same time. 
What your crossbow does also depends heavily on the kind of ammo you're using. If you're using incendiary ammo, for instance, your assault rifle crossbow will spin-up like a mini-gun and be devastating - and fiery - once revved up. Meanwhile, your sniper crossbow with incendiary ammo will behave more like a rocket launcher, exploding on impact. Frost ammo, meanwhile, freezes enemies and also creates varying kinds of frost effects - or ice walls - on the floor depending on which crossbow you use. Oh, and there's a grenade-launcher attachment too, because why not? And again, there are varying types of grenade you can fire.

<p>In the (abridged) example above, the model emits a real email address and phone number of some unsuspecting entity. This happens rather often when running our attack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox chief financial officer Tim Stuart has said Microsoft wants to get Game Pass and its first-party titles on "every screen that can play games" - including Switch and PlayStation - in what he calls "a bit of a change of strategy".


This isn't the first time Microsoft has talked about getting Xbox Game Pass on all platforms, of course; Xbox boss Phil Spencer has referenced the strategy on multiple occasions, calling it a "long term goal" for the company back in 2019.


One year on from that comment, however, it seemed as if Spencer had admitted defeat in getting Game Pass on competing consoles, saying, "The other competitive platforms really aren't interested in having a full Xbox experience on their hardware. But for us, we want to be where gamers want to be and that's the path that we're on."

In addition, developer Endnight Games has announced that Shawn Ashmore - whom you will likely recognise from Remedy's Quantum Break and, more recently, Alan Wake 2 - has joined the cast. He will be voicing Timmy.


Timmy, for those unaware, is the son of Eric LeBlanc, protagonist of the first game (which was simply known as The Forest). Endnight Games has said his role in the story will be expanded when version 1.0 goes live next year.

It marks the first time Capcom will sell the base version of a new game for that higher price point. This year's Resident Evil 4 Remake was sold for $10 less (and while a remake, it was substantially different). Street Fighter 6 was also sold at for less, as was dino hunter Exoprimal.


Capcom had been one of the few publishers not to embrace the $70 price point up until now, but the move comes as no surprise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Absurd Ventures, the studio established by Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser earlier this year, has revealed its first two projects: a graphic novel and audio drama, both launching in 2024.


When Absurd Ventures was unveiled back in June, its promotional material made it clear Houser and company were aiming to do more than just make games - with the studio saying it was focused on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres" spanning the likes of live-action, animation, games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, scripted podcasts, and more.


And true to its word, Absurd Ventures has now unveiled its first two "universes": American Caper and A better Paradise. While the studio says "additional stories" from both are in development for “a wide range of formats and platforms", American Caper will debut as a graphic novel and A Better Paradise will begin as an audio drama.

The news follows reports earlier this year that Netflix had been in talks with Rockstar to license a GTA game as part of an attempt to introduce "higher-end" titles to its mobile-focused gaming catalogue - which primarily offers a mix of casual games and acclaimed indies at present, including the likes of Dead Cells, Kentucky Route Zero, and Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.


At the time, the Wall Street Journal reported Netflix believed a more significant gaming presence would help it attract new subscribers and retain existing ones by giving them something to engage with between seasons of their favourite shows.

Zinogre, Banbaro, Barioth and Radobaan will all be introduced, alongside the smaller Cortos and Wulg. The Monster Hunter Now team has also taken player feedback on board to bring in a couple of much-requested weapons, too: the lance and dual blades.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup has been revealed for December, ending the year on a high.


Squirt 'em up PowerWash Simulator leads the charge, after launching on Game Pass last year. It lets players powerwash vehicles, houses, parks and more, alone and in co-op. It's a particularly chilled experience, though hopefully the free Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy 7 DLC packs will be included. The SpongeBob Squarepants and most recent Back to the Future DLCs are paid extras.


Also included is Sable, a sparse adventure game with a unique, line-drawn art style and music from Japanese Breakfast. Donlan described it as a "mesmerising game of exploration" in our Eurogamer Sable review.

Speaking up on X (née Twitter), Genvid CEO Jacob Navok denied Ascension has been written by AI as people are speculating, and revealed Genvid's previous tests with AI were fruitless.

In a presentation to investors, Creative Assembly owner Sega admitted that the Hyenas project had been an attempt to accelerate the studio's growth - even though the game's genre lay outside the developer's usual area of expertise.

Hyenas was cancelled in September after years in development and a public demo at Gamescom only weeks before. The decision to cancel the project resulted in layoffs at Creative Assembly, with the majority of the project's team believed to be at risk.

These are just three laptop models from the wide universe of PCs, but one of these three companies usually does make the fingerprint sensor in every laptop we&#8217;ve reviewed in the last few years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group CEO Lars Wingefors has reportedly confirmed to employees that TimeSplitters studio Free Radical is facing closure next month, as part of a sweeping restructuring programme that has already resulted in more than 900 job cuts at the company.


Word that Free Radical - a studio resurrected in 2021 specifically to revive the beloved TimeSplitters franchise - was the latest developer to be impacted by parent company Embracer's restructuring first surfaced earlier this month in a report by VGC.


The publication's sources have now shared a company wide email from Wingefors confirming that Free Radical is currently engaged in a consultation process - as per UK employment law, employees must enter into a 30-day consultation process before redundancies can be made - that could result in the studio's closure next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In news that'll surprise nobody who's been following the various leaks leading up to today's official announcement, Capcom has confirmed Dragon's Dogma 2 will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 22nd March next year.


That date first emerged earlier this month, when it was spotted as part of a (quickly removed) listing on the PEGI ratings website. It then prematurely resurfaced on Steam today, getting a little ahead of Capcom's latest Dragon's Dogma 2 showcase where it was finally made official.


And official it now is, with Dragon's Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirming the news during a 15-minute livestream that also featured a lengthy new trailer. Tucked in there was an appearance from the previously unseen Talos, a truly colossal armoured soldier striding forth from the depths of the ocean that Capcom seems particularly proud of - so much so that we got an extended look at the fight once the trailer was over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt has announced that Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for its sci-fi RPG Cyberpunk 2077, has sold 4.3m copies since launching this September - and that over 330 developers at the company are now working on the next Witcher game.


When last we heard from Phantom Liberty, CD Projekt revealed it had sold 3m copies in the first week of its release - news that was accompanied by updated sales figures for Cyberpunk 2077, which has now surpassed 25m copies sold since its rocky launch back in December 2020.


Word of Phantom Liberty's 4.3m milestone comes via CD Projekt's latest financial earnings report, which also includes an update on how the company's developers are currently split between its various projects. As of October, around half the studio - later confirmed to be approximately 330 developers by CEO Adam Kiciński in an earnings call - was working on the next Witcher game, with that number expected to rise to over 400 by "mid-next year".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's beleaguered pirate adventure Skull and Bones is - following yet another delay back in October - reportedly now targeting a 16th February release next year.


Skull and Bones has, of course, been a very long time in the making, with development starting over a decade a go in 2013. Since then, it's suffered repeated delays (it was originally expected to arrive in 2018), most recently seeing its release shift to Q4 of Ubisoft's current financial year, meaning a launch within the January-March 2024 period.


And Ubisoft has now reportedly narrowed that previous launch window down to 16th February 2024 according to Insider Gaming, which has a good track record when it comes to Ubisoft leaks. The site says the publisher is likely to make the new release date official in "the next couple of weeks", potentially during December's The Game Awards.

Recently, the Gateway API announced its v1.0 GA release, marking a huge milestone for the project.
Along with stabilizing some of the core functionality in the API, a number of exciting new experimental features have been added.
Backend TLS Policy
BackendTLSPolicy is a new Gateway API type used for specifying the TLS configuration of the connection from the Gateway to backend Pods via the Service API object.
It is specified as a Direct PolicyAttachment without defaults or overrides, applied to a Service that accesses a backend, where the BackendTLSPolicy resides in the same namespace as the Service to which it is applied.

In a statement, Fishlabs parent company Plaion (itself owned by Embracer) confirmed a "restructuring" at the studio "expected to impact around 50 positions". 

"Despite exhaustive efforts to avoid downsizing, the lack of approval and therefore financing for the studio's unannounced project (also referred to as "Project Black") has made this step unavoidable," a spokesperson said today. "The remaining team will continue to work on the existing co-development projects in partnership with other Plaion and Embracer Group studios.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of the material which will feature in The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's Lost Levels is also planned to appear in the second season of HBO's show, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann has teased. 


Earlier this month, Naughty Dog announced a remastered and native PlayStation 5 version of The Last of Us Part 2. Along with souped up visuals for the base game, this upcoming release will also have a few other bells and whistles including cut content in the form of 'Lost Levels' for players to experience. These Lost Levels will be Sewers, Jackson Party and Boar Hunt.


Meanwhile, almost in tandem with The Last of Us Part 2's remastered release, production on the second season of HBO's adaptation is set to kick off early next year. While we know the second season of the show will not encompass the entirety of The Last of Us Part 2's narrative, the series' creator has said "at least one element" of the previously mentioned cut content is "planned for the show".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's customer support team has been responding to negative Starfield reviews on Steam.


Starfield had a strong start, becoming the "biggest Bethesda game launch" of all time. Those numbers rose over the first few days of release, with Starfield's concurrent player count previously beating Skyrim's concurrent player record on Steam. 


But despite these initial player numbers, Starfield currently sits with a 'Mixed' review status on Steam. At the time of writing, 69 percent of the game's 80,365 reviews on the platform are positive. The rest are, obviously, less generous.

Since Patch 4 was released at the beginning of the month, Baldur's Gate 3 players have experienced slowdown in Act 3. The performance issues were introduced in the patch, Larian stated on X (née Twitter), and resulted in tag crimes like theft and violence being tagged as "eternally-active", regardless of whether or not players were spotted by NPCs.
Larian director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the slowdown is caused by a specific bug in Moonrise Towers during Act 2. Patch 5 will address this and "so much more," Douse wrote, when it hopefully drops later this week. Mostly I'm just looking forward to being able to ask Astarion for a kiss and actually receive one.

In a blog post today, Bungie confirmed that The Final Shape did indeed need longer "to become exactly what we want it to be".

If you've been reading for a while you may know Eurogamer has been around a few years (24!) and spent most of that time as part of the family-run Gamer Network. 


Five years ago, Gamer Network was bought by Reedpop, the pop culture-focused arm of events company Reed Exhibitions, which already ran PAX and New York Comic-Con.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NCSoft unveiled new trailers for its upcoming games Project M and LLL at G-Star 2023 which show off new features.

Project M is a narrative thriller which we first saw in June 2022 with a trailer filled with quicktime events reminiscent of Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human. The game looks packed with drama, family, violence, and the supernatural. LLL was announced a few months later in November 2022 and is a sci-fi MMO set in an alternate history which caused modern-day Seoul, the Byzantine Empire and the 23rd century to become entangled with one another.
The trailer for Project M gives us a look at a new environment, a brightly lit but dilapidated theme park. There's also some stealth and action sections which aren't driven by quicktime events, so there'll be some variety in the game's combat.

In a recent report by Variety, the outlet confirmed McDonnell's inclusion in the series. 


When discussing her wider portfolio, McDonnell said she often takes inspiration from her own experiences when writing characters. "Most of my stories start with whatever funk or crisis or feeling I'm living in, then I figure out how to explore that through speculative fiction," McDonnell shared.

The recruitment advertisement, which went live earlier this week, makes a clear connection between the success of the sci-fi shooter's multiplayer game and the ability to "work directly" with the Halo community and players who make their own maps and assets in its map-making mode, Forge.

"In this role you'll design, implement, and manage playlists that align with the needs of Halo Infinite. You'll work with partner teams to ensure content (maps and modes) is properly represented in our playlists and aligns with scheduled game events," the ad explains.

"Empower Up is suitable for all games companies, wherever they are on their EDI journey," Ukie says. "For those looking to gain more understanding about what EDI is and why it’s important, the Intro To EDI section provides an overview.

The news came via "a meeting to talk incessantly about the production of Nier Automata" presentation at the Korean video game show G-STAR 2023 – yes, I love the title, too – in which Saito talked about the development of the original game and hinted at what lay ahead for the fan-favourite series.

The free-to-play third-person action-shooter spin-off was announced in May 2021 and was initially set to release in 2021-22. Ubisoft has since been taciturn about the game's release window, but the rating – which was published earlier this month – intimates that we could be getting a firm release date soon.

Because of "violence, inappropriate language", and "anti-society" leanings – make of that what you will – the shooter has been awarded a PG-15 rating on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.

As first reported by our friends at GamesIndustry.biz, Wolfire Games – which filed the order earlier this month – brought an antitrust lawsuit against the megacorp back in 2021. Whilst Newell requested a remote deposition due to health concerns, admitting he has "structured his life to minimise exposure to possible COVID-19 transmission", Wolfire insists that there is "insubstantial evidence to suggest that he is at particularised risk of serious illness" and wants him there in person. 

Wolfire further asserts that Newell needs to attend in person because it believes he is "uniquely positioned to testify on all aspects of [Valve's] business strategy", and the company wants to "adequately assess Newell's credibility".

According to content creator Gabe Follower, the prototype – called Terror Strike – was "accidentally compiled" and added to the Counter-Strike update, showing how the zombie game's DNA lies firmly in the mod for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and was developed using CS assets, including Counter-Strike weapons.

The files were quickly pulled from the 22nd November update, but not quickly enough to stop them being yoinked and then distributed publicly.

Interestingly, the link that once led to the rating is now dead, and the game doesn't turn up if you search for it, either in English or Korean. So make of that what you will.

Right now, the collection is only available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and has not yet been confirmed for Switch, which only received a Borderlands 3 port back in October, four years after the threequel was released on other platforms.

Interestingly, it was submitted for classification quite some time ago – the website says Pandora's Box was given its 14+ rating back in August – but it's only now come to the attention of the eagle-eyed folks on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit and has yet to be added to the Nintendo eShop.

According to a patent filed in July and published publicly just last week – snappily entitled "systems and methods of dynamically modifying video game content based on non-video game content being concurrently experienced by a user" – Activision wants to keep track of what you watch and use that data to make personalised recommendations to you.

As spotted by Exputer, this would make a typically passive viewing experience more interactive, and could even mean "generating" a game just for you or modifying an existing game's content to better suit the kinds of things you like to watch in livestreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in August, as part of this year's TennoCon celebrations, Warframe developer Digital Extremes unveiled Whispers in the Walls, the next (and extremely weird) chapter in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter's ongoing saga. And as its new confirmed December launch window approaches, the studio has shared a heap of new information on what to expect come the expansion's release, including confirmation it'll arrive alongside cross-save support.


Whispers in the Walls introduces new mission types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set. It's an expansion primarily focused on the long-hidden laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos, and one that'll reveal the "proverbial big bang" that kicked off every event in Warframe.


In terms of enemies, the labyrinthine laboratory plays host to a much-expanded Necramech faction, including new Necrodogs, that players can battle using Whispers in the Walls' new Grimoire, a secondary weapon capable of flinging pages of devastating Void. But that's not the expansion's only new threat; at certain points, players will find themselves whisked away from the gothic gloom of Albrecht's lab to a vast Eldritch desert that serves as the home of the mysterious Man in the Wall. Here, they'll encounter a second new faction, the Murmur, nightmarish multi-limbed creatures resembling tech-infused biblical angels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Mario RPG's recently released Switch remake is a lovely thing, freshening up a much-loved classic for a new generation, while ensuring its core remains faithful enough that it can deliver a wonderful blast of nostalgia for long-time fans. And it turns out that faithfulness runs deep, with players having discovered it restores a fun little easter egg that was cut from the original version during the localisation process for release outside of Japan.


More specifically, the 1996 Japanese version of Super Mario RPG contained a cute - if ultimately fairly pointless - sequence that would trigger if players entered the cheat code 'Down, Up, Right, Left, L, R, L, R, B' on the pause screen.


Rather than showering players with treats to make the experience a little easier or give everyone a massive head, as cheat codes tended to do at the time, entering Super Mario RPG's sequence of button presses would instead cause Toad to materialise and ponder what the secret code you just entered could possibly have done.

Players reported seeing the adverts pop-up when they paused the action to load the in-game map. One example shared on X, formerly Twitter, shows an advert for 20 percent off Assassin's Creed Mirage fill the screen when a player accesses the map within Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

Kamiya's comments come as part of his most recent YouTube video, where the PlatinumGames co-founder said he fully expects the Bayonetta franchise to continue without him. 


"I worked on Bayonetta 1, 2, 3 and Origins," he said. "I've talked about this in various interviews, that the Bayonetta series would consist of a total of nine episodes, and that I wanted to grow the franchise as the Bayonetta 'Saga', but it seems like I may have to take the full saga to the grave with me."

Plus, its substantial 1.49 update - which adds a dynamic night sky, the moon, HDR skyboxes, and more - is out now.


Kansas was confirmed to be the focus of American Truck Simulator 's next, post-Oklahoma expansion back in February, bringing the tally of explorable states in the game up to 14, joining the previously released California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma.


American Truck Simulator's rendition of Kansas - or the Sunflower State, if you will - promises to give potential visitors and their hefty transportation a tour of the area's "native grasslands, streams, abundant blue skies, and green grassland vistas". You can see some of that across copious screenshots in SCS' launch date announcement post.

Deliver Us Mars, if you're unfamiliar, is this year's sequel to developer KeokeN Interactive's 2018 sci-fi puzzle-adventure Deliver Us the Moon. For this secound outing, players step into the massive space clogs of an astronaut, Kathy, as she travels to the red planet in search of her missing father and technology that might just help save Earth from ecological disaster. 


What follows is a mix of first-person platforming and puzzle solving reminiscent of its predecessor, although it doesn't appear Deliver Us Mars enjoyed quite as positive a critical reception as the fist game. Still, free is free, so if some cerebral spacey excitement appeals, you'll want to be pointing yourself toward the Epic Games Store over the next seven days.

While TLOU2 was launched on PS4, it's still just three years on from that game's arrival. How do we feel about there already being a "Remaster", and are its DVD extra-style additions worth a £10 upgrade? 
We also discuss some of the other remakes to arrive (again) this year, including the excellent new versions of Dead Space and Resident Evil 4. It's good these games are finding new audiences, but are we in danger of focusing too much on the past, and on safe, known franchises? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer's Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

The report stated the majority of mobile games reached peak revenue within the first 12 months of their release. While 76 percent reach their peak revenue in the first year, only four percent peak in the second year of release.

It leaves you looking like some kind of human Call of Duty snake, but it also leaves you able to zoom around while lying prone - a very handy tactic for winning gunfights.


Now, Sledgehammer has taken notice and dubbed Call of Duty snaking as a PC exploit to be looked at further. "We're investigating an exploit that allows players to sprint while appearing in the prone animation," the developer wrote on the official CODUPdates account on X, formerly Twitter.

While attending Vienna Comic Con, Sapkowski was asked about the various adaptations that have stemmed from his original works. Speaking with Cerealkillers, the author said that every visual adaptation of his The Witcher series was "strange" for him to see, because as a writer he only uses his words.


"My raw material when I work, it's only letters. I do not describe pictures. I don't see any pictures. I use the letters only because I know that my reader will see in the book the letters only, not the pictures. So I have to do with my letters to make the reader imagine the picture, not the other way around... so every [visual] adaptation, it's simply strange for me," he explained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world has been given a tiny glimpse into the uber-secretive world of Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar North thanks to a fascinating new blog from former technical director Obbe Vermeij, who, in just a few short weeks, has shed light on the studio's cancelled spy game Agent, discussed a zombie game abandoned by the company after it was deemed to be too "depressing", and more.


Vermeij served as technical director at Rockstar North from 1995 (when the studio was still known as DMA Design) to 2009, meaning his time at the company spanned the creation of Grand Theft Auto as a series right through to Grand Theft Auto 4 and its DLC.


Since launching his blog earlier this month, Vermeij has been sharing anecdotes covering a number of Rockstar games, touching on everything from the company's streaming tech for Grand Theft Auto 3 - which struggled enough that the art team was forced to shove a building in the middle of a long stretch of Portland road to ensure players wouldn't run out of city while loading continued - to early efforts at implementing multiplayer in GTA 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following some initial rumblings earlier this year, a new report has lend further credence to suggestions 2024's Call of Duty game will be another entry in the Black Ops series, this one now said to be taking place in the Gulf War.


Word that Call of Duty 2024 would be a new Black Ops game first surfaced back in February, when it was claimed next year's series entry was being developed by Treyarch under the codename Cerberus. Furher evidence backing this up arrived in July, when actor and singer Luke Charles Stafford shared a Facebook post referencing Black Ops and claiming his likeness would be used for next year's main character, "Ratcliff".


And that brings us to a new report from Windows Central which, citing "multiple sources familiar with Activision's plans", says next year's Call of Duty "is indeed Black Ops". The publication also claims the game will attempt to "explore a nuanced narrative of the Gulf War, with a critical focus on different participants within the conflict."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With winter looming, THQ Nordic has seized this most seasonally appropriate opportunity to showcase more of its upcoming South Park: Snow Day, with its latest trailer revealing a smattering of new gameplay for the co-op adventure.


South Park: Snow Day was initially teased back in August last year, making a sneaky post-credits appearance at the very end of THQ Nordic's 2022 showcase. One year on, it made a second showcase appearance, this time to confirm its title, unveil its decidedly un-TV-show like 3D visual style, and reveal a handful of other details.


We know, for instance, that South Park: Snow Day (which is being developed by The Blackout Club studio Question) is a co-op adventure in which up to four players - along with familiar faces including Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny - enjoy their day away from school by battling through the snow-blanketed South Park streets on a quest to save the world.

Neill's application for a collective proceedings order against Sony accuses the PlayStation maker of anti-competitive practices such as imposing unfair terms on developers and forcing prices up for consumers.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - which follows the continuing adventures of original series protagonist Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus (once again voiced by Mark Strong) - was originally due to launch in "winter" this year, but Focus has now announced a delay as part of an "update on execution of the line-up and partnerships".


As per Focus' revised release schedule, Space Marine 2 - which is being developed by Saber Interactive - will now launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC in the "second half of 2024", with Focus saying the delay will "provide the time needed to properly polish the game and to ensure the best possible experience".

Sweeney made the statement when he took to the witness stand yesterday in the ongoing trial between Epic and Google.
As reported by AP, Sweeney described a meeting between himself and Google at the latter's headquarters to discuss an agreement which would see Epic release Fortnite on the Play Store. "It seemed like a crooked arrangement," Sweeney said. "Google was proposing a series of side deals which seemed designed to convince Epic not to compete against them," he continued.

Each expansion will include a new playable character with unique abilities, a new island to explore, and a story campaign told across six new missions. The new characters can be used in most of the main game's missions and aren't limited to the DLC missions, Mimimi stated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has given a brief update on its missing in action Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has had a troubled development and still lacks a formal release date. 


Originally announced back in 2020 for release the following year, work on the game was rebooted when development dragged on and the project was then moved from Ubisoft Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.


Updates from the project have since been scarce, though Ubisoft broke cover last night to state that the game was still very much in development and had recently "passed an important internal milestone".

"Just two weeks in, Modern Warfare 3 has already set records with the highest engagement in the new Modern Warfare trilogy," states a post by the Call of Duty account on X, formerly Twitter.


These records include the fact Modern Warfare 3 owners are playing "more hours per player overall" and "campaign players [are] putting in more time per player" than in the modern Modern Warfare 1 and 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GameMaker, a series of cross-platform engines for game developers, has ditched its subscription model for non-commercial purposes, hobbyists and indie developers.
GameMaker will now be free for anyone using its software non-commercially on all non-console platforms. Creator and indie subscriptions have been replaced with a one-time fee of $100, meanwhile, which grants a commercial license and enables exports to desktop and mobile platforms.
The change appears to have been prompted by the recent and controversial changes Unity announced for its pricing model, which would introduce a fee for developers per game install. The plan was met with anger from indie developers, causing Unity to walk back significantly on its proposed changes.

This sci-fi third-person shooter was developed during the N64 heyday of British studio Rare, and launched during the four-year period the company also released classics such as GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64 and Perfect Dark. 


It may not have the brand power of some of those, but it's still a solid arcade-inspired adventurey shooter with a lengthy single-player and a deathmatch-style multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conveniently timed to coincide with the launch of this year's Steam autumn sale, Blizzard has announced a free trial week for Diablo 4 - plus discounts across all versions of the game - starting today and running until 28th November.


Diablo 4's free trial lets players dip their toes into the world of Sanctuary, and includes full access to co-op and crossplay, but there's one major limitation: progression is capped at level 20. Exactly how much playtime that equates to is a little unclear, especially given Diablo 4's Mother's Blessing event is also now live, boosting XP and Gold by 35% until 27th November.


Regardless, Blizzard says all trial progress can be carried over to the full game should your time with Diablo 4 convince you to make a purchase. And there's additional incentive to do so, considering all versions of the game are currently discounted by 40% as part of the Steam  sale.

Official word that a new Subnautica game was on the way first surfaced in April last year, when developer Unknown Worlds - the studio behind the series' original 2018 entry and its 2021 follow-up Subnautica: Below Zero - announced it was seeking a senior narrative designer to "help shape the next game in the Subnautica universe".


And now, a little over 18 months later, the new Subnautica has made an appearance in publisher Krafton's slate of upcoming releases, as shared via the deeply unsexy means of financial report PowerPoint slide presentation (thanks Rock Paper Shotgun). It's set to launch in "1H25" - the first half of 2025 - but, beyond that, details are limited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in September, Dave the Diver studio Mintrocket unveiled Nakwon: Last Paradise, a 16-player stealth-survival extraction game set on the streets of Seoul amid an undead apocalypse, and now - with a public pre-alpha playtest looming - it's shared 22 minutes of gameplay.


Nakwon is a game of two parts; the primary focus is Scouting, requiring players (either solo or in a team of two) to leave the titular safe zone in order to scavenge for resources out in the city. Being a PvPvE experience, the threats outside are twofold: there're the zombies - which can't be killed, meaning stealth is key to survival - alongside other human scavengers, who'll either need to be avoided or set upon with makeshift weaponry (firearms are a scare commodity).


Players can come and go as they like, meaning once they're satisfied with their haul, they can return to the safe zone, where Nakwon's more simulation-focused activities occur. Here, hard-gained resources can be sold for money, which is used to increase Citizen Grades and secure better priveliges and benefits. "Every day, you must decide whether to go out for Scouting or staying inside," Mintrocket explained previously. "But, you must consistently secure more food to avoid starvation and make the best choice whenever an unexpected event occurs."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has released a fresh Steam update that makes it even simpler to discover games supported by different controllers.


While it has been easy to find Steam games that support Xbox controllers, Valve has now built upon this function to make finding games that support both the DualSense and its predecessor the DualShock a doddle.


As part of an upgraded controller-friendly hub, Steam users can explore games by controller type when browsing the vast library. It will "default" to the controller any given user played with most recently, but there is also the option to adjust the filters.

This is the moment Fortnite will transition out of its current OG guise, which has seen all-time record engagement as the game's original map returned, and into something brand new.


The Big Bang will take place live within Fortnite on Saturday 2nd December at 7pm UK time (that's 2pm Eastern, or 11am Pacific), with online leaks suggesting a huge music star will be making a surprise in-game appearance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Court documents from the ongoing Epic Games vs Google antitrust case reveal the internet giant wanted to take over the Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer, and was willing to work with shareholder Tencent to complete a buyout.
A quick reminder of how we got here: in August 2020, Epic implemented a method to circumvent Apple and Google fees on in-game payments in the iOS and Android versions of Fortnite. The two platform-holders swiftly retaliated by pulling the game from their storefronts. Epic subsequently filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google, and the case against Apple was settled in September 2021 in favour of Apple on nine of 10 counts. Earlier this year, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulings after appeals from both parties.
Now Epic is back in court to wage its case against Google. While the court battle between Epic and Apple brought us the bizarre moment in which banana mascot Peely's decency was questioned in (apologies, in the tuxedo he's known as Agent Peely), so far the proceedings with Google have been revealing in a slightly different way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have been on the lookout for a new seasonal knitting project but are yet to be inspired, well, Remedy may just have exactly what you need. 


The Alan Wake 2 developer has just shared the knitting pattern for Saga Anderson's rather fetching Nordic-inspired jumper (which was made by her mother, you know).


The cosy jumper features a festive pattern, which includes a deer and tree motif. It is ideal for this time of year, when the nights are longer and - where I live, at least - quite a lot colder.

The lawsuit is set to be contested in Los Angeles tomorrow by Niantic, which is seeking to dismiss the case and move the matter into arbitration - something the company claims its former employees previously agreed to.


The legal dispute originally began in July, when a Niantic staff member left jobless by this summer's job cull at the company alleged that it had been a "boys club" and that she had been paid less than a male colleague despite being in a more senior job role.

The studio posted an updated roadmap to Steam, and Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen expanded on the decision to delay the DLC in a new developer diary.
"We are committed to bringing the marketed DLC content to you," Hallikainen wrote, "but it will not be landing in the originally promoted schedule." Instead, the studio is focusing on improving the game's performance on PC before working on the delayed console release and DLC packs.

Baldur's Gate 3's trial, meanwhile, offers a more generous two hours of play time (although, given how vast the game actually is, this is really just a smidgen of the full release).

Development of the KOTOR remake has been rocky since it was first announced, and last week Lars Wingefors, CEO of Saber owner Embracer, refused to comment on the state of the game during an earnings presentation.
In response to this, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb has stated the game is "not being worked on right now" according to sources close to the project. "Full stop, this game is not being worked on in any way at any studio."

Bret Robbins made the statement in an interview with Windows Central, where he discussed the reception to Immortals of Aveum, the subsequent layoffs at the studio, and putting the game onto subscription services. 
Immortals of Aveum released on 22nd August 2023, which meant it was competing with the likes of Baldur's Gate 3 (which "no one anticipated" would be so successful, Robbins said) and Armored Core 6, with Starfield releasing soon after. The studio knew Immortals' release date was in a packed window, and Robbins said "trying to create awareness for us [as a new studio and IP] was really, really difficult".

That's according to internet tipster DanielRPK , who is perhaps best known for their scoops on Marvel TV shows and movies.


DanielRPK said the upcoming Wolverine game will be, perhaps unsurprisingly, a much darker and more violent game than the studio's Spider-Man titles. Additionally, the tipster has said it will feature Madripoor, Marvel's fictional island often associated with X-Men stories (which popped up in the MCU relatively recently in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier TV series).

That's according Krafton's most recent financial report, which hints that the PvPvE shooter may release on the earlier side of its original 2024-2025 estimate. 

Project Black Budget first came to light in a different Krafton financial report earlier this year, described as a project destined to "challenge ourselves to popularise the extraction shooter genre based on our PUBG production and service experience".

Numskull worked alongside Taito to "accurately replicate the original 1978 and 1979 arcade cabinets", which went on sale this time last year. After quite the wait, pre-orders are now winging their way to players in the UK and Europe, and US players should expect their mini-cabinets in the next few weeks.

After signing 78 of the Space Invaders and 79 of the Space Invaders Part 2 cabinets – they released in 1978 and 1979 respectively – Nishikado spent a little time putting the machines through their paces, as captured in the brief clip below:

Riot had originally intended to migrate all accounts to Riot ID and then restrict the number of times players could amend their IDs, as well as charge them $10 for the privilege of changing their online identifier. 

Now, however, Riot says that in response to community feedback, it has "made some big updates to the plan" and while it is still "moving forward with Riot IDs" – and Summoner names in League of Legends will be retired as planned from 20th November – it is no longer restricting players to one name change every 365 days. It will also now permit players to amend their names for free.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a swirl of reports earlier this year suggesting a new version of The Last of Us Part 2 was in the works, Naughty Dog has confirmed a remaster of its survival horror sequel - promising "technological improvements, new modes, and new behind-the-scenes features" - will launch for PlayStation 5 on 19th January 2024.


The Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla made comments about "new editions" of The Last of Us Part 2 in July, and a Naughty Dog developer referenced a "remastered" version on LinkedIn in October. A recent PlayStation databse sighting all but gave the game away, but now it's official, with Naughty Dog sharing the news in a post on the PlayStation Blog.


The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is a native PlayStation 5 version of the 2020 PS4 original promising various visual enhancements, including increased level-of-detail distances, improved shadow quality, better animation sampling rates, and more. It'll feature two graphics modes - Fidelity and Performance, running at 4K and 1440p upscaled to 4K respectively - as well as an unlocked framerate option for VRR TVs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has promised fixes to remedy early issues with Fortnite's newly introduced age ratings system, which has left players frustrated after many popular cosmetics have become unusable in certain parts of the game in order to meet ratings requirements.


Last month bought the news Epic would be introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it called its evolution into a "multi-game ecosystem". Epic is, of course, currently trying to expand the reach of Fortnite by placing a greater focus on Roblox-style user-generated experiences build using its recently released Creative 2.0 tools - and the game's latest update means all these experiences now come with age ratings, starting at E for Everyone and going through E10+ up to Teen.


So far, so sensible. The problem is the seemingly haphazard way all this has been implemented in a game that has, up until now, been exclusively rated Teen. Essentially, as of Fortnite's latest update, every single bit of content, including all cosmetics, has been given its own age rating - and players are being prevented from accessing Creative mode experiences if they're wearing anything flagged as age-inappropriate. It doesn't help either, that seemingly benign cosmetics skins - a muscular cartoon cat, for instance - are rated Teen-only and considered unsuitable for children, while others, such as Halloween's Michael Myers are rated a-okay for the young 'uns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seminal first-person shooter Half-Life turns 25 this weekend, and developer Valve is celebrating the occasion with a special anniversary update adding new and restored content, alongside a bunch of other things. Oh, and it's made the game free to claim and keep starting today.


Half-Life, for those too young or too in denial to remember, introduced the world to crowbar-toting science nerd Gordon Freeman on 19th November 1998 (Freeman's full-life consequences wouldn't materialise until sometime later), and anyone looking to relive their memories of those halcyon days now get to do so with some fancy extra bits thrown in.


Starting with the game itself, Half-Life has received a spot of gentle massaging for the modern era. There's UI upscaling for higher resolutions ("We built most of this stuff for 640x480 CRTs and apparently some of you have upgraded since then", says Valve), and it now supports Steam Networking play and proper gamepad config "out of the box".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Aspyr Media has claimed the free cut content DLC it planned to release for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 on Switch was cancelled after objections from a "third-party".


That's according to Axios, which reports Aspyr made the claim as part of an ongoing lawsuit relating to the DLC's failure to release, which was filed by a Malachi Mickelonis earlier this year. Mickelonis argues Aspyr and publisher Saber Interactive violated California consumer law by cancelling the DLC, and intentionally deceived purchasers "in order to artificially raise sales revenues...based on qualities and features that the game simply did not possess".


Aspyr announced it was cancelling Knights of the Old Republic 2's Restored Content DLC for Switch - which was to have been based on a popular PC fan mod built from unused story content found in the original game's code - back in June, but did not offer an explanation at the time. Now, however, court documents reviewed by Axios quote Aspyr co-CEO Ted Saloch as saying the company "believed it would be able to release the content, but a third party objected and Aspyr was unable to do so."

The video, narrated by flaming beast Red XIII, uses footage from the first game to detail the story so far. The video will also be viewable from the main menu of Rebirth, or you can watch it now in the embed below.


Last week rumours suggested this sort of recap video would be included. They were right, aside from it not being a 17 minute CG film.

The mod takes Dark Souls Remastered and replaces textures with pixel art based on the original game's textures, decreases model quality, and reduces the quality of music and sound effects for a "fun, somewhat cursed, 'retro' feel," says thegreatgramcracker.
Demakes and demasters have seen a boom over the past few years, and Dark Souls now joins the likes of other FromSoftware games, including Bloodborne and Elden Ring to receive the lo-fi treatment.

Koichi Miura worked at Nintendo from 2019 to 2023 in game production and is now a freelance CG designer and YouTuber. On Twitter, he wrote about his experience at the company. It's rare to see former employees openly talking in an industry which is known for a culture of keeping quiet. 
"Nintendo was a great company," Miura wrote (as translated by Eurogamer), "but I wouldn't recommend it lightly to others," he revealed, due to the sheer amount of talent within the company.

The game's previous patch already made changes to increase the challenge of certain bosses. Now further tweaks have been made more broadly.


"It was clear (both from your feedback and our internal findings) that many bosses simply weren't posing enough of a challenge, so we have rebalanced some behaviours, as well as their hit points and damage output, to ensure they pose the correct level of difficulty at that point in your journey," read the patch notes on reddit from Hexworks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six month after its initial release, developer Arkane's beleaguered vampire shooter Redfall has received a third major patch, this one primarily focusing on performance improvements and fixes, although it does add a tiny bit of new content in the form of a gun.


Specifically, Redfall players now have access to the Basilisk, an Unrivaled Sniper Rifle that can charge the first bullet in a full magazine with UV power to petrify Vampires. It can be found in locations where Unrivaled items spawn, but is most likely to drop from Bellwether-themed containers in the open-world or vampire nests.


Beyond the Basilisk, Redfall's latest update brings bug fixes, balance improvements, and more - as detailed in its patch notes - touching on all aspects of the game, including AI and NPCs, gameplay and missions, heroes, UI, audio, and accessibility. Performance and stability is also a focus, with Arkane promising "various performance fixes related to FPS drops and stuttering."

Baldur's Gate 3 will be entering the corporeal realm in the guise of a special Deluxe Edition containing a whole bunch of physical goodies. There's the game itself, which comes on three discs for Xbox Series X/S, two discs for PS5, and a single DVD on PC - although that just contains a custom downloader app with an accompanying Steam key.


Moving onto the fancier physical stuff, Baldur's Gate 3's Deluxe Edition include three CDs containing the game's original soundtrack, a double-sided map, two patches sporting Flaming Fist and Mark of the Absolute designs, a minder flayer poster, plus 32 stickers featuring the game's origin characters, some iconic D&D monsters and more.

Tetsuya Nomura, creative director for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, previously told The Guardian the games would link up to Advent Children. Now, speaking to Games Radar, producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed once again the link to Square Enix's sequel film and discussed balancing the original story with new revisions.


"We are finally going to link up with Advent Children, that is going to be part of canon," said Kitase. "The overall storyline, the developments, will not go wildly out in a way that will not add up to Advent Children in the end. I don't think anyone wanted that, that's not what we're looking to create here.

As previously reported, the game was plagued with matchmaking issues at launch and online-only requirements. Meanwhile, its first promised 'big' patch received several delays, before finally going live earlier this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic and Persona publisher Sega has been accused of threatening some of its unionised workers with layoffs, and is now facing an unfair labour practice complaint filed by the Communications Workers of America.
In a new report from Kotaku, on 6th November Sega of America is said to have brought union members into a meeting where they were told of a proposal to "phase out" all temporary employees by February 2024.
The union, Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS-CWA), has filed a complaint with the National Labour Relations Board in response, for making affected employees attend a mandatory meeting to deliver the news rather than bargain with the union as a whole. This could be a violation of the rule which states companies must not negotiate directly with unionised employees instead of with their union.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ark: Survival Ascended Xbox Series X/S release has been delayed again.


Studio Wildcard's souped-up version of its dinosaur survival game was meant to launch on Microsoft's consoles earlier this week, having previously been expected in August. However, it was delayed at the final hour to an unspecified date, with the studio simply saying it would be released at some point "this week". At this time, Studio Wildcard said it would update us with a release date before then. 


It has now issued an update but rather than saying "hazaar, it is finally here", the studio has instead announced another delay. Again, the studio has not put an exact date on when Xbox Series X/S players can expect to see Ark: Survival Ascended arrive on consoles. It has simply said it is now "targeting" a release sometime early next week.

The company is in the midst of a "comprehensive restructuring programme" it announced in June to close studios and cut jobs, to transform the company into "a leaner, stronger, more focused and cash self-sufficient company".



In the company's latest financial report, Wingefors provided an update on restructuring progress, acknowledging the company's "first ever quarter-over-quarter reduction in headcount".

In addition, developer Ubisoft is also going to introduce an optional permadeath mode to the game. This new challenge will be available across all difficulty levels, the studio has said. 


Other than that, details are still quite thin on the ground. The Mirage team is yet to go into more about what either new mode will actually involve, but we do know that it will all be coming next month.

Epic Games' voice reporting system works by recording the last five minutes of game chat audio on a rolling basis, saved to your local device (your PC or game console). Reports of inappropriate behaviour can now include that audio so Epic can hear evidence for itself and swiftly bring down the banhammer.


A detailed technical blog lays out how Epic has come up with a series of policies over when it stores any data you choose to upload, and when voice reporting will be enabled (you can switch it off, but only if you're over 18 and playing in parties with friends with similar settings).

As with every release, Kubernetes v1.29 will introduce feature deprecations and removals. Our continued ability to produce high-quality releases is a testament to our robust development cycle and healthy community. The following are some of the deprecations and removals coming in the Kubernetes 1.29 release.
The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it w…]]></summary>

There’s been quite a lot of posts suggesting that not using Kubernetes resource limits might be a fairly useful thing (for example, For the Love of God, Stop Using CPU Limits on Kubernetes or Kubernetes: Make your services faster by removing CPU limits ). The points made there are totally valid – it doesn’t make much sense to pay for compute power that will not be used due to limits, nor to artificially increase latency. This post strives to argue that limits have their legitimate use as well.
As a Site Reliability Engineer on the Grafana Labs platform team, which maintains and improves internal infrastructure and tooling used by the product teams, I primarily try to make Kubernetes upgrades as smooth as possible. But I also spend a lot of time going down…]]></summary>

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was originally due to launch in 2022 but has been delayed twice since then, most recently following the game's controversial gameplay debut, with Warner Bros. announcing it was pushing its release back to 2nd February 2024 in order to make it "the best quality experience for players".


Eight months on, Suicide Squad has reemerged with a new Insider video series, its initial offering featuring 20 minutes of new gameplay  highlighting traversal mechanics, story elements, and a brief glimpse at the game's rendition of Metropolis.

Monolith's Wonder Woman was announced during 2021's The Game Awards, where it was described a single-player open-world action game. As spotted by Wccftech, however, a recent advert seeking a 'Lead Software Engineer, Gameplay' for the title on Monolith's website has hinted that Warner Bros. may be looking to incorporate live service elements.


The ad, which talks of helping to "deliver a superhero experience as epic as Wonder Woman herself", includes a list of daily duties associated with the job, alongside essential experience. The relevant part for this story, though, is listed under "nice to haves", wherein Monolith indicates "experience helping maintain a live software product or game" will be beneficial.

Baldur's Gate 3's journey to Xbox has, of course, been a bit of a bumpy one; Larian confirmed the acclaimed RPG would be coming Microsoft's platform back February, amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive, but noted it had "run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op."


The developer's struggles implementing split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S have continued as the year has gone on, meaning Baldur's Gate 3 hit PC and PlayStation 5 in August with still no word of an Xbox release date. Eventually, though, after hashing things out with Xbox boss Phil Spencer, Larian confirmed a "solution" had been found: it would be dropping split-screen co-op for Series S until a later date to ensure the RPG hit Xbox before the end of the year.

Hamilton joins a steadily growing number of noted sports stars and celebrities to be turned into Fortnite skins as part of the Icons series, including Naomi Osaka, Chloe Kim, LeBron James, Neymar Jr., Ariana Grande, Bruno Mars, and Marshmello.


News of Hamilton's imminent Fortnite debut was accompanied by a trailer featuring the F1 star wandering around (for some reason) a hall of mirrors then launching himself at a vaguely cat-like superhero outfit before plunging into the world of Fortnite - whereupon the outfit had magically wrapped itself around Hamilton's digital frame.

OK, so, for those of you who are still with me, I am of course talking about Herald of Darkness by Old Gods of Asgard (AKA Poets of the Fall). It is an absolute tune, and honestly, for me, this song is the best part of Alan Wake 2 (so far at least, I am still not quite finished).

However, despite a strong start which saw Starfield become the "biggest Bethesda game launch" of all time, things have tailed off a bit now. In fact, there are currently more people playing Bethesda's earlier RPG, Skyrim, over on Steam. 


At the time of writing, there are currently 1610 Steam users playing through 2011's Skyrim release, and 13,776 playing 2016's Special Edition release. That makes a total of 15,386 Skyrimmers at the present time. 


Both releases combined have a 24-hour player peak of 25,181. If we pop in the VR players as well, that number is higher still.

For fans here in Europe, this means the game is available now but contains bugs and lacks quality-of-life improvements which developer Nightdive Studios had intended to remedy in the version of the game set to officially launch elsewhere in two weeks' time.


For fans elsewhere, such as in the US and Canada, Turok 3 is still due to launch on 30th November with those final tweaks included.

Ark: Survival Ascended is no stranger to delays, of course; the full-price upgrade - which is mandatory for players wishing to continue using Wildcard's official servers - was originally due to launch in August but was delayed to October after Wildcard admitted it "found it challenging working with Unreal Engine 5.2".


October did eventually see the release of Ark: Survival Ascended on PC (albeit with a heap of performance problems), but its arrival was accompanied by a further delay for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, with both versions being pushed back to an unspecified point in "November". Wildcard finally slapped the Xbox version with a 15th November release date last week (the PS5 edition remains TBA), but that's now slipped again too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has confirmed its new stop-motion Pokémon series, Pokémon Concierge, will release on 28th December this year - and there's a fresh two-minute trailer to accompanying the news.


Pokémon Concierge, which was announced at the Pokémon Presents showcase back in February, follows the adventures of Haru, a new concierge at a southern island hotel resort for Pokémon. According to Netflix's brief blurb for the show, Haru "gradually discovers herself as she and her fellow staff members scramble to attend to the various Pokémon guests."


"I'm sure we've all [felt like] we are bombarded, under pressure, or that we don't want to get up and keep doing what we've been doing and just give up," Haru's voice actor Rena Nōnen said of Pokémon Concierge back in July, "But when you see [the show], it's really therapeutic and it makes you want to try and be the best you can be."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If it's indies you want, you're in luck (as long as you're specifically wanting them on Switch); Nintendo has aired another instalment of its Indie World showcase, this time bringing news of a canceled Shantae revival, plague-themed turn-based tactics, a launch date for developer Inkle's gorgeous hiking adventure A Highland Song, news of Outer Wilds' long-awaited Switch release, and more. If you're looking to catch up on the excitement, or simply need a reminder, you'll find a full breakdown of everything featured during the show below.


Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution sees developer WayForward reviving the cancelled Game Boy Advance instalment of its acclaimed platform series nearly two decades on. To progress through its challenges, players will need to take advantage of Shantae's animal transformation abilities, as well as her newfoud power to rearrange stages by switching the foreground and background, and it'll also feature a 4-player local battle mode when it launches next year.


Developer Pugstorm's Core Keeper is a "mining sandbox adventure" for up to eight players set in an "endless" procedurally generated cave system. There's an ancient mystery to be solved, but doing so requires players to hone their survival skills by mining for relics and resources, building bases, growing crops, and hatching pets, as they push further into the subtarrenean world and take on its monsters. This one's due to release for Switch in summer 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Highland Song, the beautiful "open platforming" adventure from Heaven's Vault and 80 Days developer Inkle, is almost here and will be launching for Switch and PC on 5th December.


A Highland Song tells the story of teenager Moira McKinnon who one day decides to run away from her life of relative seclusion in a small house on the edge of the Scottish Highlands, after recieving a letter from her Uncle Hamish, inviting her to his lighthouse on the coast.


What follows is yet another genre shift for the ever-ambitious Inkle. This time, the acclaimed studio - which has previously dabbled in the likes of visual novels, turn-based strategy, exploratory adventuring, and murder mystery - is combining its acclaimed narrative expertise with 2.5D platforming, as Moira sets off on a journey across the Highlands, where "every peak has a story to tell and every valley echoes with song."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A familiar Modern Warfare 3 skin is once again playing havoc in the game's multiplayer modes,  prompting complaints from players.

Modern Warfare 3 allows players to transfer a "vast amount" of their previously acquired Modern Warfare 2 content over to this year's Call of Duty release - including the controversial Gaia operator skin, which could be acquired as part of Modern Warfare 2's Blackcell Battle Pass bundles. This has been dubbed the Groot skin within the community given its likeness to Marvel's sentient tree-like creature. 


The Gaia skin is described by Activision as an "ancient goddess of considerable power, [that] uses her earthen form to inspire ruin in her enemies".

The disc drive was shown in action by YouTuber Mystic in a PS5 slim unboxing video, in which he walked through the process of pairing the drive with a console.

Titled Content Streaming With Gameplay Launch, the patent was filed on 11th July 2023 and publically published on 2nd November via WIPO (spotted by Exputer).

It describes a game which contains multiple "trigger points of media content". These are moments which the player could start a replay from, which would be provided "by the platform, publisher, or third-party publisher". These trigger points are described as the start of an "activity" such as a boss battle or quest, or when a player levels up.

But hone in on the last six months and the PS5's sales account for just over 50 percent of all console purchases since May.


GfK games boss Dorian Bloch said these figures are a result of various price promotions held over the summer months, the console's recent EA Sports FC bundle and, of course, "unrestricted sales" on the standard PlayStation 5 model. Unlike previous years, there are currently no supply and stock shortages for Sony's PS5 console here in the UK.

The issue – which has been around for some time now – chiefly affects players on the Colosseo map, and sees players get trapped. Without the help of characters like Lifeweaver of Mei's movement abilities to bump them out of position, they'll stay trapped, too.

Despite many players reporting they've also been stuck in this exact spot as a myriad of different players, it doesn't look like Blizzard's yet been able to address the problem.

From 14th November, there'll be a new "collection" of Bandai Namco Cross Store at London's Victoria Place which will "celebrate the physical nature of entertainment and Bandai Namco's rich brands", including Gashapon, Ichibankuji, and Sun-Star Stationery merchandise. 

"As the popularity of Japanese culture, collectables, digital and physical experience continue to rise in the UK, these new stores offer a slice of those experiences adored throughout Japan by the Bandai Namco Group supporting a passionate community," the company said, but stopped short of clarifying what other locations fans will be able to find the newly-minted stores in the future.

The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, as the film is officially titled, begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. However, as answers are slowly revealed, Geralt finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.


"He must count on friends — old and new," Netflix teases in its announcement, "to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been eagerly awaiting Nightdive Studios' Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion remaster, you'll need to hang in there just a bit longer; the developer is delaying its release by a few weeks, with the dino FPS now coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 30th November.


Nightdive's remastering of the original Turok trilogy - which was developed by the now-defunct Iguana Entertainment - has been quite the undertaking; the studio released its Turok 1 remaster eight years ago, back in 2015, and its sequel got the spruce-up treatment two years later. 


Nightdive's Turok 3 remaster - which will mark the first time the game has been available since its N64 debut in 2000 - promises to be similarly thorough, introducing enhanced environment art and character models, updated weapon models, plus "advanced rendering features" that'll include anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. has attempted to placate angry Mortal Kombat 1 players with two 'free' Fatalities following an outcry caused by the decision to introduce a $10 USD Fatality animation to the game's already heavily criticised premium store.


Despite being sold as a full-price title costing £59.99/$69.99 USD, the latest entry in developer NetherRealm's long-running fighting series features a rotational in-game shop selling store-exclusive cosmetics - including costumes and gear - only available to purchase with real-world money (in contrast, Mortal Kombat 11 also enabled players to buy cosmetics, but these could largely also be earned by completing activities in-game).


While Mortal Kombat 1's premium store has already drawn plenty of ire from players, things came to a head last month when Warner Bros. and developer NetherRealm began selling a store-exclusive Halloween Fatality animation for $10. To put that in some kind of perspective, $20 would get you several DLC characters in Mortal Kombat 11.

This latest bit of mischief is the work of the team behind Call of Duty's server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, officially known as Ricochet, which outlined its latest steps in the war against online ne'er-do-wells - particularly the role Machine Learning plays in improving its anti-cheat systems - in a timely blog post coinciding with today's launch of Modern Warfare 3.


"Combining everything [we have] developed over the course of the last two years with new Machine Learning advancements," it wrote, "Richochet: Anti-Cheat is preparing for the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 with a stronger and faster process to combat cheating."

Grubb's comments were predictably pounced upon by fans following a somewhat mixed response to this year's annual Mass Effect franchise celebrations on 7th November - N7 Day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has claimed its Call of Duty HQ launcher provides easier file management and seamless switching between games, despite criticism from players.


Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, the latest in the series, now launches from Call of Duty HQ alongside last year's Modern Warfare 2. Activision describes the launcher as "the front door for Call of Duty" and states "players have control over the footprint of their Call of Duty experience on their platform of choice, and it's all contained within one unified location".


In practice, however, it's confusing plenty of players and has resulted in huge file sizes - as previously reported, the install size of the complete package is over 200GB on some platforms.

Larian's own Swen Vincke recently shared a rather welcome update with his followers over on X (formerly Twitter). In a new post, the CEO shared two graphs showing how RAM and VRAM loads for Baldur's Gate 3's Series S port have been reduced in recent weeks. 

"Got a nice present from our engineers. Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back. I think this will benefit all platforms too," he wrote to accompany the two graphs (which you can see via the embed below).

Back at BlizzCon last week, The War Within expansion was revealed along with two further expansions to begin the multi-part Worldsoul Saga. However, the Epic edition (costing $89.99) includes guaranteed beta access and three days of early access, the first time Warcraft has offered this.


Fans have responded angrily, as per this reddit thread, but Hazzikostas said the studio is following a trend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report claims Modern Warfare 3 was developed in just 16 months. That's roughly half the time of a standard Call of Duty release. 


More than a dozen employees at developer Sledgehammer shared their experiences working on the Modern Warfare 2 sequel with Bloomberg - in particular the need to crunch by working late nights and weekends ahead of release due to its truncated development period. 


Meanwhile, sources said that Modern Warfare 3 initially started out as an expansion to last year's Modern Warfare 2 - something that was previously suggested. This expansion, which was codenamed Jupiter, was reportedly going to be set solely in Mexico, rather than a globe spanning release the Call of Duty series is typically known for.

As noted in the company's Q3 earnings report, Unity is assessing its product portfolio "to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers" and is "evaluating the right cost structure that aligns with the more focused portfolio".


Changes will be completed before the end of Q1 in 2024, which will "likely include discontinuing certain product offerings, reducing our workforce, and reducing our office footprint" (thanks The Verge).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been just over two years since acclaimed animated League of Legends spin-off Arcane launched on Netflix, but finally its long-awaited second season has the closest thing to a release date yet. The bad news is there's still a long wait in store; the streaming service has now confirmed Arcane season two will launch in November 2024.


The first season of Arcane told the story of sisters Jinx and Vi - two of League of Legends most popular champions - as they find themselves caught on different sides of a conflict between the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun, which hits boiling point after the invention of Hextech technology.


Hailee Steinfeld and Ella Purnell will reprise their roles as Vi and Jinx in Arcane's upcoming second season - which fans have been waiting for since it was confirmed to be happening shortly after the release of season one - with Katie Leung also set to return as Caitlyn Kiramman.

In a statement provided to Eurogamer after news of layoffs at the studio was broken via PC Gamer, Digital Extremes wrote, "We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division."


"We have had to say goodbye to a number of hardworking and highly valuable team members as a result," the statement continued, "and we're working with Airship to transition full control of Wayfinder to them in the coming months."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remnant 2's first expansion, The Awakened King, is right around the corner, and ahead of its release next Tuesday, 14th November, developer Gunfire Games has revealed a second copy of the DLC won't be required to play it with a friend.


The Awakened King, to provide a bit of context, introduces a new storyline focusing on the Root-corrupted (and decidedly peeved) One True King. It'll see players attempting to uncover his secrets by exploring the seaside town of the Forlorn Coast, a new area of Losomn containing dungeons and "unexpected allies". It also adds news weapons and equipment, new enemies and bosses, plus the new Ritualist archetype.


It sounds like a good solid chunk of stuff for Remnant 2 fans to get stuck into, then, and Gunfire Games has now confirmed over on social media that players won't need to own a copy of The Awakened King themselves in order to play through its storyline and visit its new location with a friend that's already made a purchase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over three years since developer Jonathan Blow announced his critically acclaimed, time-manipulating platform-puzzler Braid was getting an Anniversary Edition, but, finally, a release is in sight; it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Netflix mobile on April 30th, 2024.


Given that Braid initially launched for Xbox 360 all the way back in August 2008, its Anniversary Edition will be arriving squarely within its 15th birthday year, and a significant amount of work has been done on the original release to celebrate that milestone.


For starters, Braid's gorgeous visuals have been "hand-repainted" by original artist David Hellman. Today's press release doesn't elaborate on that much, but when the Anniversary Edition was announced in 2020, Blow said his Thekla Inc. studio was working on enhanced foregrounds and backgrounds, increased level of detail in certain areas, plus extra animations and effects to improve the feel of movement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has announced Steam Deck OLED, a revamped version of its popular handheld PC which boasts - as you might guess - a shiny new OLED screen as its star feature.


Steam Deck OLED retains the existing size and main technical specs of the current Steam Deck (so all current Steam Deck verified games will run the same on OLED models), but includes an improved display that's bigger and uses HDR.


The new OLED models go on sale next week, on 16th November at 6pm UK time priced at $549 for a 512GB model or $649 for a 1TB model. (There's also a lower $399 price right now for the 256GB current LCD model, which is sticking around as an entry-price alternative.)

Speaking to Eurogamer ahead of today's Steam Deck OLED announcement, Valve engineers discussed the features it is adding to its shinier new handheld model that were not possible to provide back when the original Steam Deck debuted. 


The company also said it was working on game projects - plural - right now which were still targeting current Steam Deck hardware performance levels (which remain unchanged in the OLED).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we stroll gamely into month two of Sea of Thieves' extremely long-delayed Season 10, Rare has announced that the second of its three big tentpole features - the new PvP-focused Skull of the Siren Song voyage - will arrive next Thursday, 16th November.


The Skull of the Siren Song provides a more action-orientated addition to Rare's piratical multiplayer adventure following the introduction of Guilds last month, essentially unfolding as an opt-in server-wide race to find the titular jewel-encrusted treasure.


Crews can opt-in to the new voyage whenever a ghostly note randomly appears on their ship's mast during play. Once a sufficient number of teams are signed up, Captain Briggsy appears to hand them all two maps maps - one pointing to a chest containing the fabled skull, the other to the key required to open it - whereupon a messy dash to retrieve them both is likely to ensue. But there's a little more mischief once the cursed skull has been found: any ship that houses it will significantly slow down, meaning it's likely to change hands a number of times before one dedicated crew manages to cash it in at an outpost.

As we have reported numerous times over the past several months, the video game industry has seen layoffs after layoffs this year. This has resulted in studios being closed, such as Saints Row developer Volition. Others, such as Epic, have seen their numbers significantly reduced. 


According to Zelnick, Take-Two has managed to avoid such consequences thanks to moderate investments and a focus on efficiency over recent years.

The game was set to release in just a few days time, on 14th November. However, the developer has now announced it has delayed the game at the last minute to "allow for additional polish time". More work is needed to make sure Broken Roads isn't broken on release, essentially, with the help of more QA testing.


In a post on Steam, the Broken Roads team stated the game was "content complete" but "coming in longer" than originally expected. The developer said its roughly 30 hours of gameplay and vast dialogue had made it "extremely time-consuming to properly test" all of the game's content.

Sony stated these sales were in-line with expectations and a 25 percent increase on PS4 units sold in the equivalent period (Q2 FY17). Further, the 4.9m PS5 consoles sold in Q2 is a 48 percent increase compared to last year, likely owing to increased stock.

But, as we all know to be the case, Bethesda ultimately decided Starfield's protagonist should remain silent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long time ago, in a press release that now seems far, far away, mobile game maker Zynga announced arena squad shooter Star Wars: Hunters for Nintendo Switch and smartphones. 


But in the years since, Star Wars: Hunters has been repeatedly delayed, with an original 2021 launch window turning into 2022, then 2023, and now - as of last night - 2024.


In a statement issued to X, formerly Twitter, last night, Zynga said it had made the "difficult decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters to 2024", without providing any more concrete launch details.

Sony announced the sales milestone today as part of its most recent financial results, prompting developer Insomniac to share the news more widely on X (formerly Twitter), alongside a rather pleased-looking Kraven the Hunter gif. 


"Thank you to our incredible community for supporting us and helping us reach this milestone!" the developer wrote, as Kraven 'Whooped' below.

Back in February 2022, Sony stated it aimed to launch over 10 new live service games. The news came days after it acquired Destiny developer Bungie



Now, however, it seems plans are being scaled back to ensure each live service game's quality, as Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki explained on a call discussing the company's latest financial results (thanks VGC).

It's the first time we've got an impression of how the game will look, with fantasy Lego characters such as a knight and a pirate with a peg-leg, and what looks like a dragon flying through the sky.


The artwork was spotted on the PlayStation Store and shared on social media by industry analyst MauroNL, who noted that the product's page had since been deleted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tired of having to explain yourself every time your friends catch you firing up Hosiery Party: Wet Potato Frenzy on Steam? Well, there's some good news: Valve is reportedly readying a feature that'll let you mark specific games as "private" so you can hide your more unusual tastes from other users while still maintaining a public profile.


At present, Steam's privacy settings don't support the kind of granularity needed to hide individual games, only enabling users to dictate broad categories - game details, friends list, inventory, screenshots, and workshop items - to keep discreet.


As spotted by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik, however (thanks PC Gamer), Valve is seemingly poised to add a 'mark as private' setting to individual titles, so they can specifically be hidden from the prying eyes of friends. That means you won't have to lock down huge chunks of your profile just to avoid difficult questions about the amount of time you've been playing Coquettish Elbow Reveal VR Edition. Or, in my case, 400 straight hours of Disney Dreamlight Valley.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its latest earnings call, Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav has outlined the company's plans to transform its biggest gaming franchises from traditional console and PC releases into "always on" live service games.


Zaslav made the comments during his opening remarks to investors, in which referred to several of the company's franchises - Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Batman, and Mortal Kombat - as $1bn gaming properties. Developer NetherRealm's Mortal Kombat 1, he noted, has sold nearly 3m copies since launching in mid-September this year.


"Our focus," he continued, "is on transforming our biggest franchises from largely console and PC based with three-four year release schedules to include more always on gameplay through live services, multiplatform and free-to-play extensions, with the goal to have more players spending more time on more platforms."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As reports of a Switch successor continue to build momentum, despite carefully phrased rebuffs from Nintendo, the Mario maker has said it'll continue to release titles for its current console "without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle."


Nintendo made the statement (thanks GameInformer) as part of its latest earnings report - in which it also confirmed Switch sales have now surpassed 132m units - writing, "Switch will be entering its eighth year in March 2024. We will continue to release new titles and content for Nintendo Switch without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle." 


The inference (which isn't the same as confirmation, of course) is that should a Switch successor launch next year, as is widely reported, Nintendo won't be viewing it as end-of-life for its existing machine. That's perhaps not much of a surprise given it'll still have a substantial number of current Switch owners clamouring for new content with no plans to immediately upgrade, but it's something of a departure from its traditional release strategy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time Splitters studio Free Radical is reportedly the latest developer to be affected by Embracer Group's sweeping restructuring programme, with the studio said to be facing closure.


Free Radical's history is a long one and complicated one; the studio was founded in 1999 by a number of ex-Rare developers and quickly made a name for itself with the much-loved TimeSplitters FPS series. In 2009, after several difficult years, it was acquired by Crytek, becoming Crytek UK, who then sold it to Deep Silver in 2014, where it became Dambuster Studios - which made this year's Dead Island 2. However, in May 2021, Deep Silver announced it was reviving the Free Radical name and creating a new studio specifically to make more TimeSplitters, with original Free Radical co-founders Steve Ellis and David Doak at the helm.


Unfortunately, VGC now reports this new Free Radical is the latest studio to be impacted by parent company Embracer Group's major restructuring programme, which was announced following the collapse of a massive $2bn deal in May and has resulted in extensive layoffs and closures throughout 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we share our hopes and fears for Nintendo's now-officially confirmed The Legend of Zelda live-action movie.
The internet has leapt upon the announcement to suggest various names for Link, but who can you really see in the role - and can it not be Tom Holland, please? And definitely not Mark Wahlberg as an aged Link from the future. 
We also discuss the Zelda film's potential story, and whether we think it will adapt any particular Zelda legend or simply follow the Mario movie's example and go through the usual plot beats. Plus: the inevitable references Nintendo must include. And also... live-action Tingle? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 5 Tactica was playable via Steam this afternoon, nine days before its official launch.
It looks like alert emails from Steam went out notifying fans of the game's release, prompting some to download it and begin playing.
The mishap was fixed about 20 minutes later, after which the release date went through a rollercoaster of changes, including 31st December 1969, before ending up (correctly) on 17th November, 2023.

Other titles we recommend checking out from Humble Choice's November games are the retro-inspired sci-fi shooter Prodeus and spaceship salvaging simulator Hardspace Shipbreaker.
We crowned Unpacking our game of the year in 2021 for its human storytelling and satisfying puzzles of tidying things up. In her Unpacking review, Malindy Hetfield called the game a "calm and tactile little sim" which also allows players "personal expression and finding fun in what's literally just stuff".
