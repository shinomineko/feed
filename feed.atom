        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog has released a second update to address some of the many complaints leveraged at its recently launch and poorly recieved The Last of Us Part 1 PC port, this one primarily targetting memory and performance concerns.


The Last of Us Part 1 finally launched for PC earlier this week after a 25-day delay designed to ensure it would debut "in the best shape possible." Unfortunately, and despite that delay, PC purchasers on Steam quickly began reporting a host of technical issues - including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - soon garnering the port a Mostly Negative rating on Valve's storefront.


Since then, Naughty Dog has acknowledged player's complaints, saying it's "heard your concerns, and our team is actively investigating multiple issues you've reported."

Arriving almost exactly four months after Vampire Survivors' first expansion Legacy of the Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari sees the minimalist survival RPG taking a trip to western Europe for an adventure inspired by fairy tales and folklore.


Deep in a great forest, where the barrier between worlds is perilously thin, lies the Foscari Academy, where generations of warriors, magic-wielders, and thieves can learn their craft.

E3 was a stage for video game companies to strut their stuff, a certain tier of celebrities to make their presences felt, and console rivals to take not-so-subtle pops at one another. 


It was a place of huge excitement and anticipation, where internet memes and catchphrases were born, and extremely vanilla marketing executives became legends. It was also a place of failure and disappointment, as outlandish concepts and eyebrow-raising price points were debuted.

However, Kirkhope is also widely known for his DK rap number, something he composed for Donkey Kong 64 all the way back in the '90s.


This little number will be introduced to a new generation of Mario-loving fans thanks to its inclusion in the Super Mario Bros. Movie (of course, there is also the chance parents have already shown the rap to their children - I certainly have). 


Seth Rogen, who voices Donkey Kong in the upcoming film, has revealed this iconic tune will be in the Super Mario Bros. Movie. In fact, it is the song Donkey Kong "comes out to", according to Rogen.

That's according to a report by Bloomberg (paywall), and as evidenced by code sourced by TheTapeDrive editor and iOS developer Steve Moser over on Twitter.


This code, which was found within the Netflix app, states: "A game on your TV needs a controller to play. Do you want to use this phone as a game controller?" This suggests the media company is at least experimenting with the use of smartphones as controllers for its games on TV, even if it has not made any public statements as yet.

Project Sirius was first outlined last October as part of CD Projekt's ambitious studio roadmap, which included a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, a new IP, the next Witcher trilogy, a remake of the first Witcher game, and Project Sirius, a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience being developed by The Flame and the Flood studio Molasses Flood.


Last week, however, CD Projekt announced its intention to write-off funds allotted to Project Sirius, saying it had re-evaluated the "scope and commercial potential of the original concept" and was now "formulating a new framework" better "aligned with the [company's] strategy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadows of Doubt, the wildly ambitious and long-in-development procedural detective noir from developer Cole Jefferies, is launching into Steam early access on 24th April.


Shadows of Doubt, which Jefferies first started discussing all the way back in April 2018, is a first-person, open-world detective sim - complete with the prerequisite snooping and stealth - set in a procedurally-generated noirish sci-fi city.


That procedural generation, which also incorporates elements of hand-crafted design, governs everything from the city's streets and fully explorable buildings to the citizens milling around the world as determined by their personal schedules.

Mask of the Rose, if you're unfamiliar, takes place in 1862, shortly after the city of Fallen London (an alternate-universe version of Victorian London) is stolen by bats and carried to a vast underground cavern system deep beneath the Earth's surface.


Here, in Mask of the Rose, players will need to pop on their investigatory hats as they attempt to solve the mystery of Fallen London's first post-plunge murder and clear their housemate Archie's name - a task that'll see them exploring "cosy, mysterious and magnificent" locations, donning outfits, doing odd jobs to earn money and resources, and replaying the mystery to uncover "deeper and deeper" secrets.

Savant - Ascent, which D-Pad calls a "shoot-em-up platformer", casts players as the Alchemist, a magical practitioner forced from their tower by a mysterious entity. The goal, then, is to return to the top by clearing stages consisting solely of two platforms - which players will need to carefully navigate as they fend off swarms of enemies using their projectiles.


Savant - Ascent is inspired by the music of Norweigian artist Savant, and its newly announced Anniversary Edition promises new stages, abilities, bosses, and power-ups, plus a new Survival Mode pitting players against a parade of bosses as they ride the Endless Elevator.

Admission control is an important part of the Kubernetes control plane, with several internal
features depending on the ability to approve or change an API object as it is submitted to the
server. It is also useful for an administrator to be able to define business logic, or policies,
regarding what objects can be admitted into a cluster. To better support that use case, Kubernetes

In a letter to staff, later shared publicly on EA's website, CEO Andrew Wilson announced the job cuts while simultaneously insisting the company was "operating from a position of strength". 


"As we drive greater focus across our portfolio, we are moving away from projects that do not contribute to our strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint, and restructuring some of our teams," Wilson told workers at the company. "These decisions are expected to impact approximately six percent of our company's workforce."

The newly announced DLC - created in collaboration with developer Everbloom Games - takes players across five familiar Forgotten Realms locations, including Candlekeep and Icewind Dale, all reimagined in chunky block-o-vision, just as you'd expect in a Minecraft crossover.


The DLC, however, goes the extra mile and then some by introducing a fully voiced 10-hour story campaign enabling adventurers and their friends - playing as either barbarians, paladins, wizards, or rogues, complete with associated abilities - to take on familiar D&D enemies including beholders, mimics, mindflayers, and, yes, dragons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wildfrost, the card-battling roguelike from Caveblazers studio Deadpan Games and artist Gaziter, now has a released date, and will be hitting the deck on Switch and PC on 12th April.


Wildfrost sends brave adventurers on a perilous journey through monster-infested tundra and icy mountains as they battle to reach the mysterious Sun Temple and save the town of Snowdwell from an everlasting winter - a quest that'll require "determination, sharp strategy and deck-building skills", according to its developer.


Stats and skills are randomised at the start of a run once players have selected their preferred Leader, and, along the way, there'll be companions to rescue and recruit, elemental treasures to unearth, merchants only too willing to flog their wares to weary adventurers, plus "wondrous wobbly charms" - with each decision contributing to a battle deck that's unique to a run.

In Tanta We Trust's action takes place 25 years before the events of the main game, after protagonist Frey is catapulted back in time to the Purge of the Rheddig - the battle that devastated the land of Athia and drove the Tantas, its corrupted matriachs, to madness. 


The DLC's ensuing quest to save Athia promises a new set of magical abilities for Frey, new companion Tanta Cinta, and "unique, vertically-designed" environments to explore.

Specifically, Kotick believed NetEase boss Ding Lei had suggested his company could sway the Chinese government's decision over whether to pass Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in the country. 


But this threat was simply a misunderstanding by Kotick, according to a number of New York Times sources familiar with a crucial Zoom call between the two company leaders via the use of translators.

In a press release on its website, the JFTC "reviewed the transaction and reached the conclusion that the transaction is unlikely to result in substantially restraining competition in any particular fields of trade. Accordingly, the JFTC has notified the Parties that the JFTC will not issue a cease and desist order, resulting in the completion of its review."



Japan joins the likes of Brazil and Saudi Arabia to approve the merger, while the deal remains under review across the world.

In a bid to prevent Microsoft's proposed $69bn takeover of Activision Blizzard, Sony has claimed the deal would be anti-competitive and even stated Microsoft could release a deliberately buggy version of Call of Duty on PlayStation.


Kotick directly addresses these statements in his email.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has shown off Jun Kazama gameplay from Tekken 8.


This is a big moment for Tekken fans: Jun made her debut in 1995's Tekken 2 and hasn't been a playable character in the mainline Tekken series since. 28 years later, she's back and it looks like she hasn't aged a day. Tekken time logic!


The footage kicks off with Jun fighting her own son, Jin, but the highlight is Jun's long-awaited encounter with Jin's dad, Kazuya Mishima. It's all a bit Jerry Springer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait is finally over for PC players eager to get stuck into Naughty Dog's acclaimed The Last of Us Part 1, but things haven't got off to a great start for Sony's latest PC port, which currently has a "mostly negative" rating on Steam.


The Last of Us Part 1 - Naughty Dog's new-gen spruce-up of the acclaimed 2013 stealth survival horror - initially launched for PlayStation 5 last September, and its long-promised PC port finally arrived earlier today following a 25-day delay designed to ensure, as Naughty Dog put it last month, its "PC debut is in the best shape possible."


Unfortunately, early word from PC players on Steam is that The Last of Us Part 1's "best shape" is nowhere near good enough, with Steam reviews (reflected in similar reports on The Last of Us subreddit) pointing to a host of technical issues, including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - even on high-end hardware.

Volition's newly released roadmap marks the first time the studio has discussed additional content for the reboot since last October when, following a particularly bug-riddled launch, it announced it would initially be prioritising "improvements over new features".


Now though, having released a number of significant patches to address Saints Row's most pressing issues in the months since its launch last August, Volition is ready to talk new stuff, starting with a free Dead Island 2 cosmetics pack this April.

The publisher initially announced its intention to attend E3's 2023 live show - which is being organised by Eurogamer parent company Reedpop for the first time this year - back in February, insisting it would bring a "strong line-up" of titles to the Los Angeles event.


At the time, Ubisoft was the only major publisher to have publicly committed to E3 2023 - which resurrects the in-person component last since in 2019, prior to COVID - amid reports Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo would all be skipping the expo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released 10 minutes of new footage for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, showing off new abilities, enemies and the sky islands.


In a special gameplay video, we get to see Link use a new Recall ability, that allows him to rewind time. Link uses this to ride a rock that had fallen from the sky back up to where it came from. Here, he then glides on to one of Tears of the Kingdom's sky islands, where he comes across new enemies known as "constructs". 


This trailer also gives us a look at the new weapon fusing mechanic. Link can add keese eyeballs to arrows to make homing arrows, and mushrooms to shields (yes, mushrooms to shields). When the shroom shield is struck by an advancing enemy, the mushroom creates a cloud of spores that engulfs the fight in a fog. This fusing technique can also be used to make vehicles like rafts from stray logs and fans, or even flying ships, thanks to the Ultrahand ability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers have spoken about the "morally and physically exhausting" crunch culture at Ubisoft Paris. 


In a report by NME focused primarily on the development of Just Dance 2023, members of the Solidaires Informatique union group for Ubisoft Paris said pre-production for the game was a "mess". 


Reportedly, the Just Dance 2023 team was "tasked with changing the Just Dance 2023 engine just 11 months before launch", while bosses continued to push ideas "that had to be considered at all costs". This was despite developers saying they were "already underwater" at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intercept Games has shared an update on its second patch for Kerbal Space Program 2.


Kerbal Space Program 2, which released in early access in February, received its first (extensive) patch earlier this month. This followed a rather rocky launch for the space-flight simulator, which saw a steep fall in player numbers soon after release, with many asking for refunds due to the game's buggy state.


Now, the KSP2 team is working on another patch, with creative director Nate Simpson noting that while it'll be "tough to beat the sheer number of fixes that went into Patch One", players can still expect "a few big ones" to arrive in Patch Two.

This follows an accusation from Nexon, another Korean developer and one which several Ironmace employees used to work for, which claimed its game (P3) was used as a prototype for Dark and Darker.


Over the weekend, Ironmace stated it had been served a cease and desist letter and DMCA takedown by Nexon, something the developer said is "based on distorted claims". As a result, Dark and Darker was removed from Steam.


At this time, Ironamce asked for "understanding" as it worked to get the game back on the site, noting that "due to the sensitive legal nature of this issue" it has to be "careful with [its] statements so as to not jeopardise [its] position".

Whilst not formally confirmed, the game – called Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania Edition, unsurprisingly enough – popped up on the US Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), clearly marked as coming to PS5 (thanks, Gematsu).

Right now, we're unclear if it's a digital release or if we'll get a physical version, too, but it'll be good news nonetheless for PlayStation 5 owners who want to experience a native Dead Cells adventure, rather than via the backwards-compatible PS4 version which released five years ago.

The game – which boasts the curious conceit that you can play alone and then later with a friend – launched in early access yesterday, and will be available as an open playtest between now and 4th April.

Like other games released in EA, the two-person development team says the plan is to "make sure that Duel Corp turns into a well-rounded product for full release" when "it's the complete experience we want it to be". Consequently, the team believes the game will be in early access "for about one year".

As is usually the case, fans have already forensically examined the teaser image, and reckon it includes the new Mazda 3, and possibly a Panamera Sport Turismo or an Audi RS5 DTM.

Dubbed "version 2", the reference secreted in the files states that whilst the severity of Left4Dead3 is "high" – whatever that means – the priority is "none", which comes as no surprise to many of the commenters on Steam's subreddit page.

Whispers of a new Left 4 Dead title have been heard from several sources for several years now. Back in December 2019, Valve News Network's well-connected Tyler McVicker told Twitter followers that "Left 4 Dead VR is real", while in January 2020, Chinese HTC president Alvin Wang Graylin shared slides from a VR presentation making mention of Left 4 Dead 3.

With much of the final, climactic level in place and the last few visual effects coming in, the developers at Sony Santa Monica realised they had a bit of a problem: there's a big plot development that happens here, essential to the entire story of God of War Ragnarok - but nobody who played the game would notice it.


The moment in question here is Atreus' big realisation, that bringing about Ragnarok is, after all, maybe not the best idea - something he notices when dwarven companion Sindri sets off a kind of magical shockwave, which destroys the Asgardian villains' defences but, also, takes out a good few innocent civilians, too.

Clocking up a record 1.5 million concurrent players earlier today (thanks, SteamDB), that means CS:GO now sports Steam's second-biggest concurrent players record ever.

Whilst it still has some ways to go to take the top spot – pole position holder PUBG Battlegrounds' concurrent record is twice as high at CS:GO's at 3.2 million – it's an incredible feat for a decade-old shooter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fan-favourite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, is getting a video game adaptation.

Paramount Global senior VP Doug Rosen confirmed to Polygon that the third-person action-RPG adaptation will be "a darker, more mature take" on the TMNT IP, reportedly likening the game to Sony Santa Monica's God of War games. 

According to Rosen, the game will follow a single Turtle – in the comic, it's Michaelangelo – although it may be possible to play as others, including perhaps other notable characters like April and Splinter, in flashbacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark and Darker has been removed from Steam after developer Ironmace received a cease and desist demand from Korean publisher Nexon.

Fans first noticed changes being made to the RPG's Steam store page overnight, when assets like videos and screenshots were quietly removed. Then they realised that online co-op and PvP had stopped working, followed by the complete removal of all traces of the game. Now, if you attempt to load the game's Steam store, it'll take you to Steam's front page.

"To all our fans, we have recently been served a cease and desist letter and DMCA takedown by Nexon regarding Dark and Darker based on distorted claims," Ironmace explained via the community's Discord server (thanks, Reddit).

This turned out to be the most difficult word of the year, in part thanks to its use of a recurring 'r', but a GDC talk yesterday from Zoe Bell, the New York Times' executive producer of games, revealed it broke a particularly whopping amount of streaks.


Typically, Bell explained, showing a chart that tracked players' streak breaks over time, "15 percent of people break their streak on a given day - except that one day, with 'parer', where almost 60 percent of people broke their streak."

The hard-hitting Tekken AI returns in the upcoming fighting game with what looks like a stance ability and new voice work - and by that I mean he grunts and snarls as he smashes up his opponent.


I love Jack's new rage art, which sees him fire a huge railgun point blank into his opponent's face. Oh, and stick to the end for a surprise stare from Jack with the visor. Truly terrifying stuff.

Speaking to DiscussingFilm, the director was asked how he was planning to approach the adaptation of Sucker Punch's samurai epic.


"Ghost of Tsushima is a really interesting story if you really dive into the tale of Jin Sakai and what the film is really about. And you tie him to these amazing visuals," Stahelski replied.

At the time of writing, there are 131,159 players working their way through the world as Leon S. Kennedy (and his lovely jacket), with that number more than likely to rise as the day goes on.


To put those numbers into more perspective, Resident Evil Village has an all-time player peak of 106,631. Then in third place, we have the Resident Evil 2 Remake with an all-time player peak of 74,227.

We have seen trailers of Mario getting launched unceremoniously through a pipe and out into the Mushroom Kingdom. We have seen an eclectic take on Rainbow Road. We have even had a plumbing commercial full of Nintendo Easter eggs.

On a basic level, Park Beyond delivers pretty much everything you'd expect from a theme park management sim, asking players to plop down rides, set up shops, hire employees, and slap down scenery in a bid to create the most appealing - and lucrative - tourist attraction they can.


The twist, though, is "impossification", which lets players create ludicrous, gravity defying rides reminiscent of Till Nowak's wonderful short The Centrifuge Brain Project - perhaps unlocking a version of the classic pirate ship swing ride capable of splitting into three independently looping segments, or rollercoasters that can fling cars across gaps using cannons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omega Force has shared more on monster-battler Wild Hearts' major April update, which introduces a new "petal-manipulating fox" Kemono, new Karakuri, and more. Additionally, the developer has added new the Grimstalker Kemono variant in a smaller update launching today.


Omega Force previously teased a big Wild Hearts update as part of the game's post-launch roadmap earlier this month, but now the developer has slapped it with a 6th April release date, and provided more details on what it'll bring.


First up is Murakumo, the aforementioned fox-inspired Kemono with the power to manipulate petals (and also the first brand-new Kemono to join Wild Hearts since launch), which drops materials needed to craft a selection of new weapons and armour sets. Additionally, it brings a new Spinning Top Kakuri, the first new Karakuri to be introduced to the base game.

Frogwares' ground-up reimagining of The Awakened - which comes to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC next month - retools the original's story of Cthulhu cults and eldritch abominations into a continuation of the young Sherlock arc started in 2021's Chapter One.


While Sherlock's updated plunge into cosmic horror still whisks him around the globe - from the smoggy streets of Victorian London to the bayous of New Orleans - Frogwares' remake places a new focus on his relationship with Watson.

As its name suggests, the Tropical Pack - which will be Planet Zoo's 13th paid DLC expansion - is all about the rainforest, and introduces a total of five new animals. There's the Lar Gibbon, the Red River Hog, the Asian Water Monitor, the Fossa, and finally, the Brown-Throated Sloth - which arrives as a Walkthrough Exhibit addition.


Alongside its critters, Planet Zoo's Tropical Pack brings 200 new scenery pieces inspired by Southeast Asia, enabling players to construct everything from Tongkonan villages to Balinese temples. New tropical flora, meanwhile, includes the Rafflesia (better known as the corpse flower) and the carnivorous Attenborough’s Pitcher Plant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[C-Smash VRS - the PSVR2 update of Sega's cult 2001 arcade and Dreamcast game Cosmic Smash - now has a demo on the PlayStation Store ahead of its 23rd June release.


The original Cosmic Smash offered something like a futuristic blend of Breakout and squash, challenging players to use a ball and racquet to clear blocks at the end of a long room within a time limit, with each "stop" on its subway-style map offering up a new challenge.


C-Smash VRS takes that same basic premise and gives it a VR twist, promising "intuitive controls, finger detection, 3D audio, and haptics", alongside solo play, a variety of online versus and co-op modes, plus a dynamic synth soundtrack from Danalogue and Rez Infinite's DJ Ken Ishii.

That's according to Paweł Sasko, who was lead quest designer on The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, and is now CDPR's quest director for the upcoming Phantom Liberty expansion. Sasko was speaking at his GDC talk on Wednesday, where he suggested it's a similar situation for Idris Elba, who stars in the DLC.


"When it comes to Cyberpunk," he said, "we discovered this very interesting factor which is star power. We had Keanu Reeves playing Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077 - and Idris Elba in Phantom Liberty - and so we had to take into account the fact that every time we had a star, players were going to fall for a star almost all the time.

The Last Ronin tells a markedly different Turtles tale from usual. It's set in a grim future where three of the four superhero turtles are dead, alongside Master Splinter. The remaining Turtle - whose identity is only revealed at the end of the book - acts as a lone avenger, taking down The Foot Clan across New York City.

Last night's startling State of Unreal presentation by Epic revealed a swathe of new features coming to the company's suite of game development tools - such as photo-realistic procedural generation on a massive scale, and the ability to translate iPhone video footage into pretty slick performance capture. Earlier this week, Ubisoft also showed off Ghostwriter, an "AI"-driven tool to suggest script lines for use in background dialogue.
But are these advancements the future of video game development, or are they an encroachment by AI into the kinds of work previously the domain of human writers and animators? Or both? Joining me to discuss all that are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

Path-tracing, which is also known as full ray-tracing, has been used in computer-generated imagery for films and TV for a while now, with notable examples including some Pixar animations. It "accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene", making things even more realistic. 


Now, this tech is coming to Cyberpunk 2077 on 11th April, in the game's Ray-tracing: Overdrive Mode.

Squads are assembled from five starting classes - with Tindalos promising "dozens of specializations, unique abilities, and weapons" to customise them further - with players needing to keep track of their soldiers' health, resources, and sanity along the way.

"We were acquired by Microsoft and it was a change with [a] capital C," Smith told the website during a recent press event (via Google Translate). "They came in and they said 'No PlayStation 5, we're focusing on Xbox, PC and the Game Pass'."

However, here he is suited and booted, with a rather deft use of a rifle, and ready to take on any Operator "who stands in his way of victory" (although, doesn't he keep getting one-upped by four turtles? Hmm, maybe he will have better luck here).

In Miasma Chronicles, players will take on the role of a young man named Elvis. No, not the king of rock and roll. Rather, someone who has been abandoned by his mother in "the wastelands of America". Elvis will not be alone on his travels, however. He will also have his robot 'brother' Diggs by his side.

However, the judge has allowed a separate part of the lawsuit to go ahead - one which seeks to claim that EA games adopted "deceptive and unconsionable acts or practices" under a Canadian consumer protection act. 


Responding to the news via GamesIndustry.biz, an EA spokesperson stated: "We're pleased that the trial court rejected, as a matter of law, the allegations of unlawful gaming. The court's decision reaffirms our position that nothing in our games constitutes gambling."

Ghostwriter was demoed on stage at GDC this week by Ubisoft researcher Ben Swanson, who stated the tool was designed for use with background dialogue, barks (generic lines from NPCs triggered by the player), and descriptions for the game's user interface.


According to Game Developer, which attended the GDC session, Swanson described the tool as like a "30,000-sided die" which could be rolled to build sentences based on an initial input combined with a modifier, with machine learning built in to ensure responses varied.

The 10-strong party lawyered up late last year to launch a lawsuit which claimed Microsoft's buyout would give the Xbox owner too much influence over the games industry "to foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition".


This week, a judge dismissed the "so-called gamers' lawsuit" as it "does not plausibly allege the merger creates a reasonable probability of anticompetitive effects in any relevant market" (thanks, Foss Patents).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a heavily redacted response to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority relating to its proposed $69BN USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft has insisted Sony would be able to create its own Call of Duty alternative within the space of 10 years.


Microsoft's newly published document has been submitted in response to the CMA's recent Remedies Hearing, discussing stipulations the regulator may insist upon before it's prepared to approve the deal. And while much has been redacted, it predominantly presents Microsoft's arguments around why its proposed 10-year deal with Sony to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation, and its signed agreements with Nvidia, should be sufficient to satisfy the CMA's concerns.


Among all this, though, is the nugget from Microsoft that 10 years should be ample time for Sony to whip up a Call of Duty competitor of its own - while glossing over the rather obvious fact Activision's shooter has had over 20 years to build the kind of brand recognition that's turned it into the juggernaut gaming franchise it is today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's live-action Gears of War movie is now one step closer to becoming a reality following the news Dune and Doctor Strange screenwriter Jon Spaihts has been hired to handle the script.


Netflix announced it had acquired the rights to adapt Gear of War into movie last November, following earlier unsuccessful attempts by 
New Line Cinema to get a live-action adaptation off the ground. That version, first trumpeted in 2007, had abandoned all pretence of being set in the game's universe by 2019, when the project became permanently stuck in development hell.


Netflix, however, has specifically described its version as an adaptation of the Gears of War "video game saga", suggesting it'll be more faithful to the source material than Universal's stalled effort - and the streaming service has now announced it'll be down to writer Jon Spaihts, whose Dune screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, to conjure a script into being.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a tiny tease last week, Paradox Interactive has properly unveiled Life by You, a new open-world life simulator that's launching into PC early access on 12th September.


Developed by Paradox Tectonic - the studio headed by Rod Humble, former Sims boss and CEO of Second Life studio Linden Labs - Life by You's marketing immediately slings shade in the direction of The Sims 4, describing the title as a game that'll let players "create humans and live out their lives without loading screens".


While the fundamentals - from house building to character creation - all seem very Sims-like, Paradox is trumpeting an "open game world where everything is customisable", alongside "real language conversation" and the ability for players to directly control their digital humans if they'd prefer something more hands-on than the default third-person view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Resident Evil 4 remake is releasing later this week, and in anticipation Capcom has upped its marketing efforts with a short Studio Ghibli-style anime based on the game. While I am no anime critic, I have to say it is glorious.


Titled "Leon and the Mysterious Village", the first episode was released earlier today. It begins with a certain Mr  Leon S. Kennedy, wearing everyone's favourite jacket, searching for Ashley. 


"I wonder where Ashely went," Leon asks himself in a rather casual manner (although, with his gun still aloft). Ah, a nice villager! Perhaps they will be able to help.

A couple of weeks back, we reported that it looked like a new version of CS:GO – possibly called Counter-Strike 2 – was in development. And while there was no formal word from Valve, Steam, or anyone else for that matter, several prominent leakers and a journalist stepped up to report that "a new version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is on its way", saying it is "almost certainly set to be released under the working title of Counter-Strike 2".

And now the rumours seem even more likely after PCGN spotted that Valve Corporation recently filed a US trademark application for "CS2".

Guardians are marking Reddick's death by gathering alongside Zavala at the Tower, where dozens of players are sitting in quiet contemplation, some marking his passing with sombre emotes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layers of Fear - the somewhat confusingly named remake of developer Bloober Team's psychedelic horror hits Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2 - has resurfaced with an 11-minute trailer showing off some of its gameplay changes and fancy new Unreal Engine 5 visuals.


Layers of Fear (formerly Layers of Fears) is co-developed with Anshar Studios, and sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt and reimagined in Unreal Engine 5 as a single, generations-spanning "psychedelic horror chronicle". It also includes new chapter The Final Note, offering a different perspective on the events of first game. 


Bloober's new gameplay walkthrough finally answers one of the lingering questions around the remake, namely how its disparate elements will be turned into something resembling a coherent whole. That job, it turns out, is the responsibility of new lighthouse-bound character The Writer, whose "harrowing tale...ties each entry in the series together".

Staff were told of the changes at 4pm this Friday afternoon in a mandatory all-hands meeting, those who were present told Eurogamer.


Impacted team members include those in the company's art and design teams, Eurogamer understands, as the company shifts its focus further towards its publishing side, and external development of its own IP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EU regulators have delayed a decision on Microsoft's proposed $69BN acquisition of Activision Blizzard after the company submitted remedies in its efforts gain approval.


The European Commission had previously announced a provisional deadline of 25th April for its decision on the controversial takeover, but, as reported by Reuters, that has now shifted to 22nd May as its reviews Microsoft's latest submissions.


Details of these remedies have not been made public, as per EU policy, but it's likely these relate to a flurry of recent deals Microsoft has signed in a bid to be seen as willing to bring Call of Duty - a particular sticking point for regulators in the EU, US, and UK - to competing services.

As Kubernetes develops and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones for the project's overall health. Based on the information available at this point in the v1.27 release process, which is still ongoing and can introduce additional changes, this article identifies and describes some of the planned changes for the Kubernetes v1.27 release.
A note about the k8s.gcr.io redirect to registry.k8s.io
To host its container images, the Kubernetes project uses a community-owned image registry called registry.k8s.io. On March 20th, all traffic from the out-of-date k8s.gcr.io registry will be redirected to registry.k8s.io. The deprecated k8s.gcr.io registry will eventually be phased out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, Bethesda's forthcoming space RPG, has been given a Restricted rating in Australia.


As spotted by GameInfinitus, the game's classification is primarily due to interactive drug use, as well as the strong impact of violence and some nudity.


The Australian Classification Board has a particularly low tolerance to drug use in games. The likes of Disco Elysium, DayZ, and RimWorld were all initially banned from sale in Australia due to themes of drug use.

This update follows a rocky launch for KSP2, which saw a steep fall in player numbers soon after its release, with many asking for refunds.

Creative director Nate Simpson stated the KSP2 team has implemented "a lot of big improvements" with this update, including a fix for the bug that saw environmental objects "[spawning] on top of the active vessel" (something that would cause the Kerbal Space Center to move).

No, he's not topless - though there's a Resident Evil 4 Remake demo mod for that if you so choose. Instead, Fortnite's Leon is missing his iconic jacket from the early stages of Resident Evil 4, and indeed any other style option. 


Fans have complained it is a missed oppurtunity for Fortnite's version of Leon, and compared his character model to those for fellow Resi stars Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, who are already available in Fortnite featuring multiple outfits from their various appearances.

Specifics remain incredibly limited at present - the title is currently in the pre-production phase according to Splash Damage - but it's being described as an "AAA open-world survival game" developed in collaboration with streamers Mike "Shroud" Grzesiek and Chris "Sacriel" Ball.


There's no Project Astrid footage or even a hint of concept art at this early juncture - today's announcement trailer and assets are solely focused on the involvement of its two big-name streamers - but Splash Damage says it'll have more to reveal "in the near future".

"What is Unreal Editor for Fortnite? Why should I care?" I hear you ask. Well, here's the thing. This software is likely not going to herald any grand new addition to Fortnite immediately at launch.


Over time, however, it will transform Fortnite into an advanced platform for custom-made games and experiences - where you can launch almost any Unreal Engine-made creation to an in-built audience of millions.

"SIE [Sony Interactive Entertainment] cannot protect against the loss of Call of Duty," Sony wrote in a document published today by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority regulator, which is currently scrutinising the deal. 


Simply put, Sony says it cannot compete with a Microsoft-owned and Xbox-exclusive Call of Duty via its own blockbuster first-party franchises: not in terms of gameplay hours, revenue, or in the budget it has to spend on building its own exclusives.

WWE ultimately admitted McMahon had paid $19.6m to settle various sexual misconduct claims over the past two decades. Despite this, McMahon returned to the company to serve as its chairman in January of this year.

Steam Deck designer Pierre-Loup Griffais commented on the feasibility of an OLED model in an interview with PC Gamer, in which he explained why it won't be possible in the near future.

"The screen's at the core of the device," Griffais explained. Putting in an OLED screen to replace the Steam Deck's LCD screen wouldn't be a simple swap, he continued, as all of the components are architected around each other for a device that's so small.

The news follows last year's underwhelming launch of Need for Speed Unbound, which arrived to a warm critical response but little fanfare from publisher EA.


Fuse Games will be led by former Criterion boss Matt Webster, with four former Criterion co-founders in senior roles. Together, the team has worked together for nearly two decades on Criterion's various projects: Burnout, Battlefield, Star Wars: Battlefront and Need for Speed.

Dubbed "SOS Tomatoes", the map is designed to highlight a genuine good cause: the falling levels of soil quality  worldwide due to over farming. Information on the map will detail more about the threats to soil health - and hopefully provide some proper STEM learning.


Heinz describes the experience as a "one-of-a-kind", with a faster shrinking storm to... highlight the "rapid rate at which soil health is declining". Now that's quite the pickle.

Volume 2 - said to be the first in what will presumably be a series of post-launch updates for Criterion's well-received racer - looks to bring a little bit more of everything, starting with the introduction of cop chases in multiplayer. "Stay ahead of the chase to make Bank while your friends help knock them off your tail," is how Criterion explains the addition in its announcement, "or take the Heat off you for their own rewards.


Alongside multiplayer cop skirmishes - which come complete with new banner rewards - Volume 2 ushers in Daily Challenges, with players able to complete up to three (selected from a pool of 40) each day in order to earn XP and Bank. There's also a "special luxury ride" for those that complete enough challenges.

Ghostwire: Tokyo, if you're unfamiliar, comes from The Evil Within and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, plunging players into a supernaturally hued open world jaunt around an absolutely gorgeously rendered Tokyo - one almost entirely purged of human life thanks to some nefarious shenanigans.


Reviews were middling at launch thanks to some rather same-y combat and some basic mechanical building blocks that are recycled just a little bit too often, but, personally, I've been having a blast of late bounding across Tokyo's rooftops, sucking up souls, and getting a thorough (and often quite spooky) education in Japan's rich folklore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game director Mathijs de Jonge has promised Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC will fully embrace the "power" of the PlayStation 5, in a bid to explain why the add-on is exclusive to Sony's newer console. 


Burning Shores will see Forbidden West's protagonist Aloy heading out to the "untamed wilds of Los Angeles" following the events of Forbidden West's main campaign.
However, despite the base game releasing across both PlayStation 5 and PS4 consoles, Burning Shores is a PS5 exclusive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's excited for the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake - but there's another reimagining of Capcom's survival horror classic to look out for. 


The hugely-talented animator Cara Aleatorio has recreated Resident Evil 4's opening in digital Lego, in a polished and surprisingly authentic homage.


From the original audio cues and camera angles taken from the game to the wear, tear and thumbprints on the digital Lego models, this is quite the treat for those who have this opening to the original Resident Evil 4 seared in their brains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has confirmed that, after eight years and with a sequel in sight, the end is nigh for Cities: Skylines' DLC support, with a final selection of content arriving in May.


The news comes as Cities: Skylines developer Colossal Order - which recently announced a long-awaited sequel for release this year - shares one last roadmap for its acclaimed city building game, starting with a first drop of DLC next Wednesday, 22nd March.


This'll take the form of three new Content Creator Packs - Africa in Miniature, Sports Venues, and Shopping Malls - plus three new radio stations. JADIA Radio Station brings 16 Africa-inspired tracks from musician Wan Shey, while 80's Movie Tunes is a fairly self-explanatory set of 15 tracks totally around 70 minutes of music. Finally, there's Pop-Punk Radio, which promises 16 track and 75 minutes of "powerful, high-beat tunes".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The messy saga of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM - which has been embroiled in a series of legal tussles relating to the involuntary departure of key team members in 2021 - has reached a new milestone, with the company announcing several of those lawsuits have now been resolved.


It's a story that first made headlines last October, when ZA/UM founder Martin Luiga claimed Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov had been fired following the company's takeover by Estonian businessmen Ilmar Kompus (now ZA/UM CEO), and Tõnis Haavel, previously convicted of investment fraud.


Not long after confirming the news of their departure, Kurvitz and Rostov shared an open letter claiming Kompus and Haavel's takeover of ZA/UM was fraudulent and that they were booted out of the studio while trying to discover more. Kompus and Haavel then fired back, insisting the former employees had been dismissed for "belittling women and co-workers", creating a "toxic environment", and "intending to steal IP".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Heart Machine has shared a first gameplay trailer for Hyper Light Breaker - its fully 3D rogue-lite follow-up to 2016's acclaimed Hyper Light Drifter - alongside the news it'll be entering Steam early access some time this autumn.


Hyper Light Breaker, which was unveiled last March, trades its predecessor's wonderfully explorable top-down, 2D world in favour of a "vast, ever-changing" 3D landscape - blending handcrafted and procedurally generated elements - known as the Overgrowth.


Here, amid open biomes and deep labyrinths, players (working solo or with up to three friends) can deploy a mix of acrobatic abilities - wall-dashing, hoverboarding, gliding - and third-person combat as they take on monsters and bosses in an attempt to overthrow the Abyss King.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive has slapped a 4th April launch date on its first-person building and raiding game Meet Meet Your Maker, confirming that - alongside its PlayStation, Xbox, and PC retail release - it's coming to PlayStation Plus on day one.


Meet Your Maker whisks players (either solo or along with a co-op friend) to a post-apocalyptic wasteland where they're able to build their own maze-like outpost filled with devious traps and patrolling guards. Once the stage is (literally) set, that outpost is then hoovered up into the internet ether, whereupon other players can raid it in an attempt to best its challenge.


"Every outpost in Meet Your Maker requires you build a clear path from its entrance to the Genmat at its core," Behaviour Interactive explains in a post on the PlayStation Blog, "but nothing says this path should be easy to navigate... Twisting hallways, verticality, multiple branching corridors, and trap-filled dead ends are all great ways to confound raiders."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken veteran Marshall Law has always been a pretty on the nose copy of legendary martial arts movie star Bruce Lee, but his incarnation in the upcoming Tekken 8 ramps the familiarity up another notch.


Bandai Namco released a gameplay video showing off Marshall Law in Tekken 8, below, and it includes all the Bruce Lee mannerisms you'd expect: the 'come and get some' hand signal, the high-pitched noises, the nose flick and the finger point.


In the trailer we see Law use nunchucks as Lee famously did in his iconic Hollywood hit Enter the Dragon. He also flexes his muscles as Lee did in his movies. He even copies Lee's facial expressions.

These cuts come on top of the previous 10,000 job losses announced back in November last year, which equated to a loss of 13 percent of all Meta employees globally. 


Announcing the changes publicly via his Facebook page, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg blamed higher US interest rates, global geopolitical instability and increased regulation, on top of last year's slowdown in revenue which he dubbed as a "humbling wake-up call".

It's a very similar deal to the one Microsoft previously announced with Nvidia to bring Xbox PC games its GeForce Now streaming service.

Now, co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin have shared a little bit more on this part of the series, calling it a "God mode power up".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports that E3 2023 would be a no-show for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, Microsoft has confirmed it won't have a show floor presence at this year's event - although its recently announced online showcase will be part of an E3-branded week of digital shows.


News that the big three console manufacturers would be skipping this year's E3 - set to be held between 13th and 16th June - was first reported by IGN in January. One month later, Nintendo confirmed its absence, saying, "We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis [and] this year's E3 show didn’t fit into our plans".


It wasn't particularly surprising news, given Nintendo hasn't held a major E3 conference for over a decade now and last had a showfloor presence at E3 back in 2019, but there were hopes that this year's organiser (Eurogamer parent company Reedpop) might be able to coax the major players back in its attempts to revitalise a flagging formula - which, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, hasn't had an in-person component since 2019.

The Witcher 3's long-in-the-works next-gen update finally arrived late last year, but was plagued by reports of technical issues and poor performance on both PC and consoles.


CD Projekt's first big stab at remedying these problems arrived in February's 4.01 patch, but, despite some progress, issues persisted. As Digital Foundry noted, for example, while PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X saw some performance improvements in their 30fps ray-tracing mode, 60fps Performance Mode had somehow ended up considerably worse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard has insisted it remains "committed" to Call of Duty: Mobile after Microsoft recently told UK regulators the game could be "phased out" over time with the full launch of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile this year.


Microsoft made the claims in its latest response to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, which is currently investigating the company's proposed $69BN USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

Nintendo confirmed Tears of the Kingdom would retail for $69.99 in the US - $10 above the price it usually adopts for its big blockbuster titles - at the start of February, leading some to wonder if this may be the new standard for the company's games moving forward.


The move would certain align with a growing number of other publishers - including Sony, Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft, and Take-Two - who've recently looked to position $70 as the new normal for many of their games on consoles.

That's coming from series co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin. Ahead of the first season's finale (which aired last night/early this morning, depending on where you are. You can read my spoiler-heavy thoughts on it here), Druckmann and Mazin took part in a virtual press conference for the show. 


Here, they addressed the first season's somewhat reduced action compared to the game it is based on. Please note, this article contains spoilers for both the show and the game. Please read on at your own discretion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has once again broken its all-time concurrent PC user peak, 11 years after it launched on Steam, and just a month after setting the last record.

The shooter - which has been around in one form or another for over 20 years at this point - recently surpassed its own concurrent record, hitting an all-time peak of 1.32 million players last month.

In a tweet on the game's official Twitter account over the weekend, the team thanked its 1.4m Twitter followers for "organising and playing CS:GO concurrently today", which was a very smooth segue into noting the shooter's all-new concurrent record.

The first in an "entirely new class category" called Specialists, the Artist is "capable of tactical versatility with illusion powers, and specialises in supporting her team".

"The Artist’s Class identity is built around the Harmony Meter Identity Gauge," Amazon explains. "Landing skills on enemies will fill up three Harmony Orbs which can be used to cast two Identity Skills – Moonfall and Sunrise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew that Endnight's early access survival horror Sons of the Forest has been a big hit – it almost instantly blew up on Steam, and managed to sell "over two million copies in the first 24 hours" – but now that success is tipping over into its fan-favourite predecessor, too.

As detailed on the PS Blog, predecessor The Forest has seen a spike in player count, too, proving to be a favourite for players on Sony consoles as well as PC.

Whilst the game has been, admittedly, consistently popular, since the release of Sons of the Forest, the prequel has catapulted back into PlayStation's Top 10 chart. According to Sony, it was the eighth most-downloaded PS4 game in the US/Canada in February, and the third most-downloaded in Europe, with only Minecraft and The Last of Us Part 2 proving more popular.

"It was at that moment when we basically had to make decisions about Stadia that we realized that, at Google Cloud, we are at our best when we’re helping other people build this stuff, not necessarily building it ourselves," Google Cloud’s director of game industry solutions, Jack Buser, told Axios.

In a new interview, the game's original director Masato Kato and composer Yasunori Mitsuda acknowledged that whilst originally a way to commemorate the RPG's 20th anniversary, the Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition also sought to ensure the game would be playable in the future even without backwards compatibility.

"Back when the project was launched, Chrono Cross was possibly going to become unplayable," remaster producer Koichiro Sakamoto explained in an interview, as spotted by GamesRadar+.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With several delays now behind it, a release is finally in sight for The Lord of the Rings: Gollum - and ahead of its arrival later this year, developer Daedelic Entertainment has shared a fresh look at its stealthy action in a new gameplay trailer.


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is, if you're unaware, forging something of a unusual path through Middle-earth, taking its wide-eyed protagonist on an adventure that promises moments of both "subtle tactical stealth" and "fast-paced parkour action" across a mixture of open levels and more linear missions.


It's a journey - one set before the events of The Lord of the Rings, chronology fans - that'll span some familiar locales,  ranging from the the mountains of Mordor to Mirkwood Forest. And it's all shot through with an intriguing branching narrative element that'll affect gameplay situations, dialogue, even animations and sound, depending on whether players give prominence to Gollum or the Sméagol side of his personality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three weeks after Wild Hearts' arrival, developer Omega Force has released the first free post-launch content update for its wonderful Monster-Hunter-like, this one introducing a new Kemono variant - the Hellfire Laharaback - plus a heap of balance adjustments and fixes.


Hellfire Laharaback is an extremely powerful variant of the base game's Lavaback (it's officially classed as a Volatile Kemono according to Omega Force, meaning it's very much considered end-game content) and arrives as part of a new quest challenging players to "quell the torrid inferno before it reduces everything to ash, and restore tranquility to the island."


Defeating the Hellfire Laharaback will reward players with the new Fire Fiend Appeaser title, and the chance to acquire the new Infernal Blow skill, which increases the likelihood of setting targets ablaze and boosts the power of attacks against burning targets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dotemu's stupendous beat-'em-up revival Streets of Rage 4 has just received a big free update on all platforms, adding the likes of new co-op moves and a custom survival mode.


For the most part, today's update is focused on fixes, tweaks, and balance adjustments - over 300 in total, according to Dotemu - designed to finesse the already stellar core experience. These range from the addition of new destructible objects around stages to help maintain combo counters, to specific character improvements.


However, there're also new co-op-focused moves, including the ability to sling your partner across the screen - at which point they're able to hit a button and perform a special attack.

Lego's Super Mario line launched back in 2020, and has so far seen the release of over 60 interactive, connectable sets - although a number of more complex sets, including Mighty Bowser, have been released outside the Lego Super Mario branding.


For its Mario Day reveal, though, Lego has returned to its Super Mario line, revealing the Dry Bowser Castle Battle set - not to be confused with the already released Bowser's Castle Boss Battle expansion, in case you were sure you'd seen similar before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a gameplay trailer for veteran Tekken character Paul in the upcoming Tekken 8 and while the famously hard-hitting puncher hits as hard as I'd hoped, it's his hair that's caught my eye.


We've known rough and tumble Paul had let his hair down for Tekken 8 since his redesign was unveiled last year, but seeing this new video, below, crystalises how I feel about his do - and it's not good. Rather than pore over his moveset (yes, the Deathfist is present and correct), I found myself fussing over Paul's fancy locks, which appear to have a life of their own.


Paul has one of the most iconic hairdos in video games. The physics-busting blonde hightop has been a key part of Paul's look ever since Tekken exploded onto the scene in 1994.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Professor Layton and the New World of Steam has shown off a neat twist to this surprise puzzle-solving sequel's story.


After a long wait for a new entry in the series, New World of Steam will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.


It's here that Layton's former protégé Luke has been living following the events of 2010's The Unwound Future, and where he has since made a name for himself as a local detective. The newly-arrived Layton, meanwhile, is an unknown - and so in this game the usual rookie/pro relationship will be reversed.

With this update, the Early Access game will now include items such as binoculars and hang gliders. There is also a new mini-boss battle for you to test your mettle against (although, just as a heads up, this patch has also halved shotgun damage, so something to bear in mind if you go in guns blazing).


In addition to the above, a range of other quality of life features have also been implemented thanks to the game's first patch. Players will now be able to lock doors, berries have been tweaked to give slightly more fullness and there are a variety of animation improvements.

Its underperformance, coupled with that of "many" smaller games also released by Square Enix in the past year, has left the publisher unsure whether it will achieve its previous target of year-on-year financial growth. 


"Reviews of Forspoken... have been challenging," Square Enix stated in a new financial results presentation. "However, the game has also received positive feedback on its action features, including its parkour and combat capabilities, so it has yielded results that will lead to improvement of our development capabilities of other games in the future.

Jackson set tongues wagging last week when he posted the familiar neon-pink logo for Rockstar's Vice City on Instagram and cryptically claimed that "this shit bigger than Power" - a reference to his previous hit TV show. 


That post was later taken down by Jackson, and we now have official word via Deadline that the project simply shares a name with Rockstar's much-loved GTA entry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2 lands today, bringing with it a heavy dose of Asian-inspired architecture from both the past and the future. 


The game's Island map has been radically changed via areas themed around ancient temples, as well as a huge neon city location. It's here, in this latter area, you'll be able to hop on grind rails to get about and shoot while on the move. It's this season's biggest new gameplay mechanic. 


But there's plenty more in store - not least a floating island location which will rift into the sky mid-match.

The game's upcoming Contagion Bundle will add 14 new ways for this to happen. Sorry Jacob!


As previously announced, The Callisto Protocol's Contagion Bundle will add a permadeath mode to the game when it releases on 14th March. It will also see the addition of the Watchtower Skin Collection.


In the meantime, if you are yet to experience all of the death animations that came with The Callisto Protocol's launch, you can check out Zoe's extensive video cataloguing them below. May I recommend finding a cushion to hide behind before hitting play.

Sunbreak originally released for PC and Switch last June, introducing a wealth of new content to Rise. There's the challenging new Master Rank, the new Switch Skills Swap function - enabling players to register two attack loadouts for a quest - plus new area The Citadel.


The latter is a diverse new zone, featuring the likes of lush forests, icy mountains, foggy swampland, and a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece, and arrives alongside a new hub area in the form of bustling port town Elgado Outpost.

Known as the Chainsaw demo, it all kicks off near the beginning of Resident Evil 4, when Leon enters the game's mysterious village. And yes, there will be a chainsaw involved. I don't want to say I called it, but I totally called it.


In a rather bold move, Capcom has stated there will be no time limit on this demo and you can play it as many times as you like. Below is a little trailer for it all - enjoy!

Ghost Trick, for those unfamiliar, was created by Ace Attorney designer Shu Takumi, and follows the adventures of the strikingly besuited Sissel, who is surprised to wake up as a spirit - and minus his memories - at the start of the game. 


Thankfully, though, while his memories might be missing, his newfound spirit form grants him new abilities, enabling him to possess inanimate objects around the various environments in order to influence events and progress to the next portion of the wonderfully engaging story.

So far, we've been given a lovely intro to animation studio Illumination's cheery interpretation of the Mushroom Kingdom, a giddy second trailer - complete with a roaring Rainbow Road Mario Kart ride - a full scene featuring some wonderfully reworked music, a cat fight, and finally, and perhaps most endearingly, an oddball faux plumbing commercial for the Mario Bros. 


This time around, though, for Nintendo's last trailer before release, we get a little bit of everything and, it turns out, a LOT more Rainbow Road. There's a caged Luigi (played by Charlie Day), a somewhat unhinged Star Sprite, Seth Rogan's Donkey Kong getting the Fire Flower treatment, and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it tour of some iconic Mario locales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. has reportedly delayed the launch of Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League once more, moving its release from May to sometime "later this year".


Suicide Squad - a canonical follow-up to Rocksteady's Batman Arkham Knight, playable solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - was announced in August 2021 and expected to release the following year. Last March, however, Warner Bros. made the decision to push its launch into "spring" 2023 to make "the best game we can."


As this year got underway, Warner Bros. was finally ready to announce a 26th May release for Suicide Squad, but a new report from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter, claims the publisher is now ditching that date in favour of a new launch "later this year". Windows Central's Jez Corden made similar claims, saying he was hearing Suicide Squad might be pushed back as far as "Q4-ish".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been eagerly awaiting more on RoboCop: Rogue City since its announcement back in 2021, today's your day. Publisher Nacon has released a new "gameplay overview" trailer and confirmed a launch delay from the previously announced June window into September.


This is Nacon's second gameplay video for RoboCop: Rogue City, but given how little actual gameplay was included in the intial one, this latest is arguably the first time developer Teyon (which made the rather wonky Terminator: Resistance) has been able to give a real sense of how things will play out. And that appears to be a mix of first-person gunplay and detective work.


 In the video, we see RoboCop patrolling the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit in search of a suspected drug trafficker. He's able to profile ne'er-do-wells using his fancy gadgetry as he makes his way to the likely scene of the crime - an arcade - and once inside, there's an opportunity to do a bit of scan-based detective work, where he uncovers evidence of drug use on the premises before bothering a potential informant at the urinal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myst developer Cyan Worlds has given its steampunk VR puzzle adventure Firmament a release date, confirming it'll be launching for PC and Mac on 18th May this year.

One year later, Cyan launched a Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the development of Firmament - which it calls a "deeply immersive narrative adventure game that stays true to the concepts that made the adventure genre great" - and now, following a number of delays (it was initially expected to arrive in 2020), a firm release date is finally here.

The new species is native to Singapore, and its discovery was reported on by Singapore broadsheet The Straits Times. 
The cockroach was first observed in 2016, when it was collected in a survey at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. After dissecting some specimens and comparing them to known species of cockroaches, the cockroach has been determined to be a new species never recorded before.

Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, as the prequel is officially known, follows the fairytale-inspired adventures of Cereza - the child version of adult Bayonetta introduced in the series' first game - and her demonic companion Cheshire.

 
The pair embark on a genteel action-adventure rendered in the style of an illustrated storybook, in which players do a spot of platforming, solve puzzles, and occasionally battle creatures across the perilous Avalon Forest - using the left stick to control Cereza and wield her magic and the right to unleash Cheshire's might.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wargroove, developer Chucklefish's Advance-Wars-inspired turn-based strategy game, is getting a sequel, and it's coming to PC and Switch at some currently unspecified future time.


The original Wargroove released back in 2019, giving starved Advance Wars fans a solidly entertaining, gorgeously presented slab of turn-based strategy action - featuring a few new tactical twists, such as unit synergies - with a splash of Fire Emblem fantasy thrown in.


A free (and sizeable) co-op-focused expansion, Double Trouble, launched in 2020, and now, a little over three years later, Chucklefish has revealed a follow-up is on the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has told the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) it's confident Activision Blizzard can optimise Call of Duty to run on Switch after the regulatory body raised concerns around the console's "technical limitations".


As part of its ongoing efforts to convince regulatory bodies in the UK, EU, and US to approve its $69BN USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard - which has so far been blighted by concerns it may choose to make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox, hampering PlayStation's ability to compete - Microsoft signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo guaranteeing it would bring the FPS to Switch.


However, in its Provisional findings report published last month, the CMA said it was unable to place "material weight" on Microsoft's agreement when considering the proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, as there was "no certainty [the deal would] lead to CoD becoming available on Nintendo". Elaborating further, it highlighted the "technical limitations" that "would need to be overcome for Call of Duty to become available for Nintendo Switch."

In a statement provided to Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson said, "Since the CMA issued its Provisional Findings, we have offered solutions which address its concerns and increase the deal's benefits to UK players and game developers. These include a guarantee of parity between Xbox and PlayStation on access to Call of Duty and legally binding commitments to ensure that Call of Duty is available to at least 150 million more players on other consoles and cloud streaming platforms once the deal closes."


Referencing its proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard more generally, Microsoft added, "The decision now lies with the CMA on whether it will block this deal and protect Sony, the dominant market leader, or consider solutions that make more games available to more players."

As to the specifics of its showcase, Microsoft isn't saying much right now, only that it'll run ahead of a special Starfield-focused Direct at some currently unspecified time.

On the song front, The Outsiders have signed up Lacuna Coil's Cristina Scabbia and Lorna Shore's Will Ramos to provide vocals for the new compositions which, as with Metal: Hellsinger's other tracks, have been written by Two Feathers.

Reports of layoffs at Take-Two first surfaced via Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who claimed the move would impact employees at Take-Two's Private Division - the publishing label behind the likes of OlliOlli World and Kerbal Space Program - and other unspecified parts of the company.


Take-Two acknowledged it had laid off staff - but did not confirm affected divisions or the number of employees impacted - in a statement provided to PC Gamer, saying it had made "targeted reductions in our US teams, primarily in corporate operations and label publishing" that would have an "minimal" impact on its US development studios.

Lince Works was founded in 2014 and released its debut title, Aragami's first instalment, two years later. It proved successful enough that a sequel arrived in 2021, and the studio revealed it had started focusing on "brand-new adventures" in September last year.


Now, however, in a message shared on Twitter, Lince Works has announced it will "effectively stop the development of new projects indefinitely, starting this April."

Catalog, which Playdate creator Panic describes as a "boutique digital on-device and web based storefront", arrives today and marks something of a departure for the company, which has so far only distributed Playdate games through a seasonal release model.


With the arrival of Catalog, however, players can purchase individual titles on-demand either directly from their Playdate or via the Catalog website. 16 games and apps will be available at launch - 11 of which are brand-new - and Panic says it'll be expanding the curated selection over time. It also assures owners it'll remain possible to sideload and purchase Playdate games and apps from other storefronts such as Itch.io and Gumroad.

However, not content with just booting the offending parties out of their games, the Escape from Tarkov team has taken things one step further and compiled a spreadsheet of all the cheaters it has booted out. It has then shared this document with the public (if you want to scroll through it for yourself, here it is).


As reported by TechCrunch (via PC Gamer), Battlestate Games said it recently banned 6700 cheaters and added all of their nicknames to this document.

As shared on Xbox Wire, 343 Industries' head of live performance Sean Baron discussed the future of seasonal updates.



"In our preview of Season 3, I said that this is the beginning of what seasonality is for Halo Infinite. But 'seasonality' is restrictive. To me, seasonality is really about consistency - we need to be consistent in everything. I feel very confident with where we've gone with Season 3, and I have very strong confidence that we're going to be able to keep improving that consistency, and avoid, completely, the long seasons of the past," he said.

An ARG is an augmented reality game, and this one in particular covers the events just before Resident Evil 4 begins. It serves as a little bite size prequel, if you will. 


Known as "Baby Eagle Is Missing", this ARG tasks players with solving a handful of puzzles that will help locate the US President's daughter, Ashley Graham (who is codenamed "Baby Eagle").

Now, in a statement to Axios from a senior executive at the publisher, Rovio could reverse its decision to remove the game - or if the change is successful it could remove it from iOS too.

Movie would be released two days earlier than previously expected in the US and "60 other markets". At this point, it was unclear whether the UK fell into the "other markets" category.


Now, however, Universal has cleared that up, and stated The Super Mario Bros. Movie will be released on 5th April in the UK. This is the same as in the US.


If you've been struggling to keep track of when The Super Mario Bros. Movie is due to arrive, you are not alone. After all, Universal has shunted its release date around the calendar on numerous occasions.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We are currently witnessing dramatic advances in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). They are already being adopted in practice and integrated into many systems, including integrated development environments (IDEs) and search engines. The functionalities of current LLMs can be modulated via natural language prompts, while their exact internal functionality remains implicit and unassessable. This property, which makes them adaptable to even unseen tasks, might also make them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting. Recently, several ways to misalign LLMs using Prompt Injection (PI) attacks have been introduced. In such attacks, an adversary can prompt the LLM to produce malicious content or override the original instructions and the employed filtering schemes. Recent work showed that these attacks are hard to mitigate, as state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-following. So far, these attacks assumed that the adversary is directly prompting the LLM...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The CMA has been sceptical about Microsoft's $68.7bn bid to purchase Activision Blizzard, most recently stating it could harm UK gamers, resulting in "higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation". It believes players would abandon PlayStation for Xbox.



However, based on a YouGov survey commissioned by Microsoft back in January and shared with Axios, just three percent of all PlayStation users would switch to Xbox if Call of Duty became exclusive.

Sea of Thieves' Season 9 - which launches next Thursday, 16th March, just ahead of the game's 20th March anniversary - is somewhat unusual in that it isn't really built around one single flagship new feature. Instead, it's tweaking, finessing, and refreshing the game as a whole in a bid to create a more coherent, enjoyable experience after five years of disparate updates.


For starters, come the new update, all World Events - from ship battles to Ashen Lords - will dynamically scale to match different crew sizes. Additionally, emergent event - the kraken, megaladon, fog, and ship wrecks - have been adjusted to make them a more common occurrence after having all become increasingly seldom seen as updates have continued.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of today's announcement showcase, Paradox has teased Life By You, a new game from former head of Sims and CEO of Second Life studio Linden Labs, Rod Humble.


Little has been shared about Life By You beyond a brief teaser trailer, but it's being developed by Paradox Tectonic, the Humble-run studio unveiled back in 2019.


At the time of Paradox Tectonic's establishment, Humble said the studio would focus on creating "open, fun, beautiful games which respect the players' intelligence and enables their creativity, freedom, emotion, and sharing", and we've now got our first look - albeit brief - of what the team has been working on since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of today's announcement bonanza, Paradox Interactive has officially unveiled its long-awaited city builder sequel Cities: Skylines 2, which is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 at some point "later this year".


Cities: Skylines 2 is being developed by Colossal Order and promises a "revolutionary" spin on the studio's acclaimed 2015 original, giving players the tools to "build any kind of city they can imagine and follow its growth from a humble village to a bustling metropolis".


How Cities: Skylines 2 will differ from its predecessor in more specific terms, beyond a shiny new facade, is currently unclear, but Paradox says the game - which it calls the "most open-ended city-building sandbox on the planet" - will enable players to "create and maintain cities that come to life like never before."

As its name suggests, Tours and Tournaments has something of a focus on outdoor pursuits, and will, for intsance, let players host grand demonstrations of feats of arms around the map - an activity that'll attract nearby nobles and wandering knights, and potentially boost social standing or military prowess along the way.


Players' best knights can also be honoured with special titles and accolades that grant bonuses to both them and the armies they lead.

The Lamplighters League - or rather, The Lamplighters League and the Tower at the End of the World to give it its full name - is described as a original pulp adventure set in an alternate 1930s. It'll pit players against a nefarious global cult, the Banished Court, out for global domination.


"For millennia," Harebrained explains, "all that stood between this sinister cabal and their plans was a band of heroic scholars known as the Lamplighters League. Unfortunately, the best of the best are all gone, so now it's up to the best of the worst."

On the space-flight simulator's release in Early Access, many found the game unplayable due to a collection of bugs and frame-rate issues. At this time, many reviewers on Steam suggested players stick to the original Kerbal Space Program game until the developer irons out some of the kinks plaguing its sequel. 


And, well, it looks like many are doing just that, with Kerbal Space Program 2's player count already dropping below its predecessor's numbers in recent days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get set, Counter-Strike fans – it looks like a new version of CS:GO – possibly called Counter-Strike 2 – could be on the way.

As there's been no formal word from Valve, Steam, or anyone else for that matter, all we can do right now is chalk this up to either a mistake, a hoax, or a hilarious misunderstanding. If a recent NVIDIA leak is correct, however, and executable files called "cs2" and "csgo2" have indeed been discovered, a beta could launch as soon as later this month. 

Alongside a curious tweet from noted Counter-Strike leaker @gabefollower, which unveiled the curious additions to the NVIDIA driver update, journalist Richard Lewis has also stepped up to confirm that "a new version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive [is] on its way" and reckons it is "almost certainly set to be released under the working title of Counter-Strike 2".

As reported by Games Wirtschaft and spotted by VGC, a court in Hermagor ruled that the football game's FUT packs violated the country's gambling laws. 

According to lawyer Ulrich Salburg, the plaintiffs - which include one minor - had allegedly "gambled away" hundreds of euros on FUT packs when the uncertain monetary value of the packs purportedly violated the Austrian Gaming Act. Consequently, the court alleged that the controversial loot boxes could be classified as "illegal gambling".

Eurogamer understands this reorganisation relates to Ubisoft's business offices rather than game development studios. In a statement to NME, Ubisoft refused to "share" any more details given that the "process is ongoing", but did say: "Ubisoft’s publishing group is working on a strategic reorganisation of its European business subsidiaries".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Less than a year after Meta ramped the price of its Meta Quest 2 VR headset up by $100, the company is slashing prices back down - albeit only on the 256GB model and only by $70 - starting this Sunday, 5th March. It's also discounted its pricey Meta Quest Pro by $500.


At the time of last year's price hike, Meta insisted the increase was necessary as "the costs to make and ship our products [have] been on the rise". Now, though, it's saying it's dropping the price of Meta Quest 2's 256GB model from $499.99 USD to $429.99 in order to "let even more people feel the joy of fully immersive games and experiences".


The price drop goes into effect this Sunday in a select number of territories - specifically, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK, and the US - and will mean there's now only $40 price difference between the 128GB and 256GB models. Meta hasn't shared the updated prices in local currencies as yet.

And while you've got your diary out, it's also announced a date for this year's TennoCon so you might as well jot that down too.


The Duviri Paradox, if you've not been keeping up with the news, introduces Warframe's fourth open-world area - following the Plains of Eidolon, Orb Vallis, and the Cambrian Drift - and plunges players into the fantasy-western-themed world of Duviri, most notable for the fact it exists inside the mind of the expansion's new big bad, Dominus Thrax.


Beyond its distinctive setting, The Duviri Paradox also features a striking stark black and white aesthetic (with the world slowly blooming into full colour over time), a new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees Digital Extremes "flirting with rogue-like elements", and, for good measure, a fancy skeletal horse steed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you had high hopes of hunkering down for a spot of Wii U Mario Kart 8 or Splatoon multiplayer this weekend, there's some bad news: Nintendo has pulled both games offline while it addresses a security vulnerability, with no hint as to when servers may return.


Nintendo took both games offline at 4.30am this morning in the UK, and confirmed the downtime on its server status page, explaining, "This network service is currently unavailable due to urgent maintenance required to fix a vulnerability related to online play."


As noted by VGC, Nintendo dataminer OatmealDome has suggested the security issue affecting Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon is likely to be ENLBufferPwn - a vulnerability common to network code present in a number of first-party Nintendo games that makes it possible for a hacker to connect to another player's device and remotely execute code.

The hotly-anticipated action game released earlier today and had garnered plenty of interest with its demo. Alan Wen gave the game a recommended badge in his review on PlayStation 5, but performance on PC seems to be hit-and-miss.
At time of writing, Wo Long is in the top five best-sellers on Steam. The game peaked at 75,906 concurrent players on the platform earlier today (as recorded by SteamDB), making it one of Team Ninja's most popular games on PC.

His conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regulators, especially regulators in the United States, often fear accusations of stifling innovation. As such, the cryptocurrency space has grown over the past decade with very little regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>But fortunately for regulators, there is no actual innovation to stifle. Cryptocurrencies cannot revolutionize payments or finance, as the basic nature of all cryptocurrencies render them fundamentally unsuitable to revolutionize our financial system&#8212;which, by the way, already has decades of successful experience with digital payments and electronic money. The supposedly &#8220;decentralized&#8221; and &#8220;trustless&#8221; cryptocurrency systems, both technically and socially, fail to provide meaningful benefits to society&#8212;and indeed, necessarily also fail in their foundational claims of decentralization and trustlessness...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

When I initially saw this mod, I questioned its value. Dead Space has one of the cleanest HUDs of any game, and its ability to view Isaac Clarke's health and Stasis module via the back of his suit remains inspired.


That said, a first-person view - where you are unable to see enemies approach from behind and have to mentally keep track of damage - is surely even scarier.

Jack Black, the voice of Bowser, may have promoted a little more than he had anticipated in a recent appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show - and ended up having his crotch blurred.


Black appeared with co-stars Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, and Keegan Michael-Key in a series of videos uploaded to YouTube by the official channel for The Kelly Clarkson Show. The others showed up in smart casual fashion, whilst Black was "tricked" by the others into dressing up as his Mario movie counterpart.

Matsuda has served as CEO for decade, during which time the company has seen a mix of fortunes. Square Enix's western studios have been sold off, its high-profile Marvel's Avengers project failed to find success, and most recently its Japan-made blockbuster Forspoken flopped.


The company has lined up Takashi Kiryu, a young exec who joined Square Enix in 2020, as Matsuda's replacement.
