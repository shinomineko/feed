        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is, alas, almost time to bid a fond farewell to Henry Cavill's stoically sweary take on Geralt of Rivia in Netflix's The Witcher adaptation. He'll be hanging up his sword and locks of white in the show's upcoming Season 3 Volume 2, which Netlix is now teasing in a newly released trailer.


Season 3 of Netflix's wonky The Witcher adaptation kicked off with five new episodes at the end of June, and it'll come to a close with the release of three more episodes on 27th July.


And as for what's in store, lots of special effects, overwrought emotion, and a whole heap of action judging by Netflix's new Volume 2 trailer, which also manages to chuck in a unicorn and far too much of Jaskier's terrible Season 3 haircut for my liking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After developer Larian shifted the release date of Baldur's Gate 3 forward a month to avoid clashing with Bethesda's highly anticipated Starfield, Dragon Age creator David Gaider's roleplaying musical Stray Gods is now moving back a week to avoid Baldur's Gate 3.


Stray Gods (subtitled The Roleplaying Musical for the benefit of those with leaky genre brain) was originally due to launch on 3rd August, but Summerfall Studios - where Gaider is co-founder and creative director - has now revised its release date to 10th August, explaining, "We want everyone to have ample space to check out Stray Gods when it launches. Baldur’s Gate 3 is hotly anticipated (by us, too!) and we want to give our fans room to celebrate Stray Gods."


However, it seems Larian's fantasy epic isn't the only reason for Stray Gods' short delay; Summerfall calls releasing the game across Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC simultaneously a "huge undertaking for any team, let alone an indie shipping its first title" and says the extra week "allows us to have performance parity as close as possible - across every platform."

As spotted by Insider Gaming, actor and singer Luke Charles Stafford recently shared a post on Facebook claiming Activision would be using his likeness for "their next main character" in a Call of Duty apparently set to release "next year".


"Activision decided to adapt their next main character, 'Ratcliffe' for Call of Duty off my face/likeness, and I am elated," Stafford wrote. "To all of my college roommate back at Anderson University and those years in Smith Hall Playing Black Ops 2... Next year, we can beat the snot out of each other again, but I want to play as me."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has finally whipped back the veil of secrecy around its FIFA replacement EA Sports FC in cash-splashing style, revealing a whole heap of new league licensing deals, new gameplay details, and (as widely expected) a release date of 29th September this year.


EA Sports FC24 is, of course, EA's first major football outing without the FIFA brand, which the publisher announced it was ditching last May. Since then, we've been introduced to EA Sports FC's official logo (it's a triangle made of letters with a triangle in it), and, more recently, had a reveal for the game's premium-priced Ultimate Edition cover. Which was a tad unsettling.


Today, though, it's all go on the EA Sports FC24 news front, as EA aimed to convince of its continuing place in football with a flashy, no-expenses-spared showcase featuring the likes Alex Scott, Didier Drogba, Luís Figo, Ronaldinho, Leah Williams, and Erling Haaland - who'll feature on the cover of EA Sports FC24's Standard Edition.

The latest line of Pikmin merch on the UK and Ireland website for My Nintendo Store comes in the form of bud vases, a vase for a single flower, in the shape of Pikmin.
It's an adorable idea, as you can put a leaf, bud, or open flower in to make the Pikmin look how they do in-game. You can even branch out and put different varieties of flowers in, taking some inspiration from the mobile Pokémon Go-like game Pikmin Bloom.

Banishers was unveiled in December last year, and is a supernatural action RPG which follows the story of ghost-hunters (and lovers) Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith. The pair go to New Eden, a community being haunted by spirits, where Antea becomes a spirit herself. 
Today, Dont Nod has announced a release date along with a new trailer which gives a few more hints about the game's plot. The video below shows the perspective of Charles Davenport, a friend of the protagonists who seems to blame himself for what has happened to them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch recently unveiled its new Partner Plus programme that offers an improved revenue split, but streamers have now described to Eurogamer it as "anti-community".


The programme was announced last month for launch in October, and is set to offer a 70/30 revenue split - higher than the usual 50/50 between streamers and Twitch. However, the criteria for this higher revenue split is very specific, meaning few streamers will likely reach the necessary requirements.



Speaking to Eurogamer at TwitchCon Paris, many Twitch Partners criticised the programme and stated its threshold was unattainable.

Following months of legal wrangling a US judge cleared the way for Microsoft to complete its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, after deciding the FTC had not sufficiently proven why it should be blocked. 


The FTC, as had been expected, is now appealing this decision - and has already filed to begin the process as quickly as possible.

In better news, its long-promised closed beta begins later this month.


Solar Crown - which ambitiously promises a full digital recreation of Hong Kong Island and its 550km of roads to recklessly careern around - got its official unveiling back in 2020, and was originally expected to launch across all platforms in September last year.


However, as May 2022 rolled around, publisher Nacon announced it was shifting Solar Crown's release back to some undisclosed point in 2023, and confirmed it was ceasing development of the previously announced PS4 and Xbox One versions "with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles and maximising the overall quality of the game".

Reports that Roblox was coming to Meta Quest first surfaced earlier this year, when sources told The Verge the move would likely happen toward the end of 2023. It now seems those estimates were a little off; today's confirmation of incoming Meta Quest support doesn't provide an exact launch date, but it does reveal an open beta will be added to Meta Quest's App Lab "soon".


In an official announcement on the Roblox developer forum, the company explained, "Traditionally, developing a VR experience required a team that had VR-specific experience and skills. With Roblox, developers will soon be able to publish their existing experiences to support VR with little to no additional coding effort required. This is because Roblox is designed to be universal, allowing the same experiences to run everywhere."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed its next batch of Game Catalogue additions for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, which, as of 18th July, will include the likes of It Takes Two, Undertale, World War Z, The Ascent, and - for Premium retro fans - Twisted Metal 1 and 2.


It Takes Two (PS4, PS5) is one of July's big draws, serving up some acclaimed co-op platform action as Cody and May, two parents-turned-toys on the edge of a divorce, must battle against the odds to return to the real-world. The Game Catalogue version includes a Friend's Pass, meaning someone who has the game can invite a friend who doesn't to play for free.


It's joined by Neon Giant's absolutely gorgeous top-down cyberpunk action-shooter RPG The Ascent (PS4, PS5); Saber Interactive's well-received four-play co-op zombie slayer World War Z (PS4, PS5); Toby Fox's cult favourite RPG Undertale (PS4); extreme off-road action in SnowRunner (PS4, PS5), and long-distance tactical blasting in Sniper Elite 5 (PS4, PS5).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA's 2005 open-world racer Need for Speed: Most Wanted could be getting the remake treatment if a recent post from a voice actor on the original game proves to be accurate.


Word of a remake for Need for Speed: Most Wanted comes via <a href="https://twitter.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1679059692981747712
">now-deleted Instagram and Twitter posts (as spotted over on the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit) from actor Simone Bailly who - alongside various television appearances over the years in the likes of Stargate SG-1 and The L Word - played Officer Turf in the original 2005 game.


According to Bailly, a "Need for Speed: Most Wanted Remake is being release in 2024", and we can surmise it's a new version of EA Vancouver's 2005 original rather than developer Criterion Games' 2012 racer of the same name, as Bailly says she'll once again be starring as the "partner" of protagonist Sergeant Jonathan Cross.

Chatting at Develop:Brighton earlier today, studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said Guerrilla faced technical challenges when developing the Zero Dawn sequel, as it was releasing across two generations of consoles. 


"It was almost up until the last moment that we didn't know whether we could support the flying on PlayStation 4," the developer said (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). "We were like, 'Do we need to cut the whole feature of the game? That's going to make such a mess'."

The feature, available to Xbox Insiders for now, will allow players to capture a 60-second video clip of an in-game voice chat and submit to the Xbox Safety Team for review.


The safety team will then evaluate the user report to determine if a policy violation has taken place, with an updated notification feature detailing to the player that submitted the outcome of the report and the reasoning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to this week's milestone court decision which clears the way for Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal in the US, and potentially in the UK as well.

We discuss why the court sided with Microsoft and what is likely to happen next, including what remedies Microsoft may be considering to get the deal over the line with the UK as well. Could we see a future where the UK lacks Call of Duty streaming on Game Pass? Or any form of streaming via Game Pass altogether?
Finally, we ponder the games industry's next steps in general. Will the sale of Activision Blizzard further open the floodgates to yet more acquisitions? And how will Sony counter? Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has suggested a "new merger investigation" into Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard is not out of the question, following Microsoft's court case win against the US Federal Trade Commission yesterday. 


The CMA has remained an outlier in Microsoft's ongoing bid to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard, being one of the only bodies to oppose the deal. 


In April, the CMA cited concerns over the deal's proposed impact on the cloud gaming sector as its reason for blocking the acquisition, stating Microsoft's ownership of Activision Blizzard risked "stifling competition in this growing market".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's currently a question mark hanging over the Xbox versions of Baldur's Gate 3. They are happening but they're held up by Xbox Series S, which is struggling to run split-screen co-op at an acceptable performance standard.
An added complication is that Microsoft wants feature parity across the Series X and S versions of the games - so much so there's a suggestion Larian would not be able to release one Xbox version of Baldur's Gate 3 with split-screen co-op, and the other without it.
The last we heard from Larian was that it was working on it, and that it was weighing up some "compromises" - the suggestion being that split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S could, potentially, be removed. So when I spoke to Larian boss Swen Vincke about this last week, I asked whether a decision had yet been made.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly "leaning toward" an appeal of yesterday's decisive court verdict that cleared the way for Microsoft to complete its Activision Blizzard acquisition in the US.


A Bloomberg report states that the FTC currently favours launching an appeal, but has just days to do so.


Microsoft cannot close the deal in the US before Friday this week, while the deal itself is set to expire next Tuesday, 18th July. It's therefore expected Microsoft will act swiftly, and seek to complete the acquisition once and for all this coming Monday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Craig Mazin, writer and showrunner on HBO's smash hit The Last of Us TV adaptation (and creator of HBO and Sky Atlantic's acclaimed prestige drama Chernobyl), has removed his name from Gearbox's long-in-the-works Borderlands movie amid what appears to be an increasingly tumultuous post-production period for the project.


A Borderlands movie was first announced back in 2015, but it wasn't until five years later, when Gearbox announced Hostel director Eli Roth would be directing from a script by Mazin, that the project finally appeared to be moving forward in earnest.


Things progressed quickly after Roth and Mazin's involvement was confirmed, with a succession of major acting talent - including the likes Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jack Black - all signing up to join the star-studded cast prior to the start of shooting in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Eclipse, the studio behind last year's acclaimed Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, has announced it's giving a similar "interactive documentary" treatment to Prince of Persia designer Jordan Mechner's 1984 classic Karateka later this year on Xbox and PC - as part of a new series of releases, each one focusing on a different seminal game.


Things kick off with The Making of Karateka, a historical delve into Mechner's noted martial arts game that'll combine interviews, video, design documents, audio, and photos to create what the studio is calling the "deepest, most exhaustive exploration of the making of a single video game that's ever been attempted in a video game itself."


"In The Making of Karateka," the studio explains on Xbox Wire, "you'll meet Jordan Mechner - not the legendary veteran game designer we know today, but the unknown teenage college student who was desperate to break into the video game business. Through excerpts from his college journals, galleries of his design documents, and all-new video interviews, you'll share Jordan’s struggles and triumphs as he creates a video game like no one had ever seen before."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years (well, one year and 11 months to be more precise) after its debut on Switch, PlayStation and PC, Axiom Verge 2 - the sequel to developer Thomas Happ's acclaimed retro-styled Metroid-a-like - is finally available for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.


Axiom Verge 2 builds on its 2015 predecessor's exploratory action with a quest to "discover the origins of the Axiom Verge universe", beginning as new protagonist (and billionaire owner of the Globe 3 conglomerate) Indra heads to Antarctica in search of her daughter.


Here, Indra discovers a portal to an entirely different reality - a ruined Earth-like world infected by parasitic machines - that she'll need to explore and overcome, battling deadly monsters along the way with her melee-focused abilities if she wants to survive.

Hellboy Web of Wyrd was formally announced last December, teasing an original storyline crafted in collaboration with series creator Mike Mignola, as well as a striking aesthetic designed to evoke the visuals and atmosphere of the comics.


While specifics still remain relatively sparse some six months on, we do known it'll take place in The Butterfly House, a strange residence built upon "occult ley-energies" whose many doorways lead to a "terrible and fascinating" dimension known as The Wyrd.

Last week's courtroom battle hinged on whether the FTC could be allowed an injunction to temporarily block the deal while it investigated further. But in reality the case was viewed as a referendum on the deal's overall ability to still be successful.
Defeat in court would have left Microsoft's effort to buy the publisher behind World of Warcraft, Diablo 4 and Candy Crush dead in the water, Microsoft had previously admitted.

Twitch created a team of LGBT+ streamers from the UK and Ireland who were added to a specific Pride Month "shelf" on the front page during the month of June, though this was located beneath other recommendation feeds and lacked promotion on social media.


Speaking to Eurogamer at TwitchCon Paris, members of this team stated it wasn't beneficial and would like to see Twitch improve its support for LGBT+ streamers not just during Pride Month but throughout the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study conducted by the Video Game History Foundation and the Software Preservation Network has revealed that 87 percent of classic games released in the US are out of print.

The remaining 13 percent can be easily accessed - whether that's through a re-release on modern platforms or through an officially provided emulation service, but the majority of older games remain unavailable through easy means.

The study was produced in order to substantiate the amount of video game history in danger of being lost, the Video Game History Foundation said, and provide evidence on why libraries and archives should be allowed to preserve games in a similar way to other media forms such as books and films.

The project was known as Sister Sonic, though the character wouldn't have actually been Sonic's sister but a long lost relative and "more mature girl" with "sexy charm". No footage of the game exists.


Though the game was previously rumoured, YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming has unveiled the truth behind its development.

Wrote Larian in a community update: "Baldur's Gate 3 has more cinematic dialogue than three times all three Lord of the Rings novels combined. It has 174 hours of cinematics, making it more than twice the length of every season of Game of Thrones combined."
This, however, raised concerns over how much cinematic dialogue people would be watching while playing the game, and whether it would interrupt the flow.

Earlier this year, Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4 required players to create new characters each season. This sparked debate across the board, with many believing the decision would leave a sour taste in the mouths of Diablo 4's more casual players. 


But while controversial, this move is similar to how seasonal content worked in Diablo 2's ladders and Diablo 3's seasons. Diablo 3 did have something else going for it, however - the Rebirth feature.

A "supermajority" of 144 employees spread across marketing, localisation, product development, and quality assurance at Sega of America revealed its intention to unionise back in April, with the aim of securing higher base pay, improving benefits, and more.


At the time, the group confirmed it had contacted the National Labor Relations Board in order to file for an election, to which Sega management were said to be "investigating and considering the options available". That election has now taken place, with 91 employees voting yes and 26 voting no out of 200+ eligible employees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're just a couple of weeks away from the launch of Peacock's Twisted Metal television show, and, with the publicity machine now in full swing, we've been given our best look yet at the vehicular combat series' live-action adaptation, courtesy of a new two-minute trailer.


This isn't our first glimpse at the Twisted Metal TV series, of course; April offered a brisk introduction to Anthony Mackie's "motor-mouthed outsider" protagonist and the tiniest tease of iconic villain Sweet Tooth (voiced by Will Arnett and played by Samoa Joe), while June showed the pair exchanging quips and violence in a follow-up clip.


And now, with launch day in sight, Peacock has released a considerably more wide-ranging looking at the action fans can expect. There are cars! Guns! Cars being shot at with guns in a shopping mall! We get a peek at post-apocalyptic San Francisco, and the rather more gnarly post-apocalypse beyond the city's walls, plus a look at Neve Campbell as Raven and Thomas Haden Church in the role of Agent Stone.

But much more importantly than that, the publisher also unveiled its first bit of cover art for the game - this one being for the premium-priced Ultimate Edition, with the standard one still to come - and it is... quite odd?
Player faces have always occupied a strangely prominent spot in FIFA fans' minds, often being one of the first things referred to when comparing differences between the latest version from EA and Konami's rival series eFootball (formerly PES).

Moore's credits include both Arcanum and Bloodlines, as he was a lead artist and designer at developer Troika Games from 1999 to 2004. On his website, Moore states he was involved in narrative, content, and character design for both games.

Given "early development footage" is stamped across all snippets of gameplay and most of the action comes from early tests, it's safe to presume that development has moved on since this footage was captured, but nonetheless, it provides a tantalising glimpse at what's in store.

<blockquote><p>A mysterious squid-like cosmic cloud, this nebula is very faint, but also very large in planet Earth&#8217;s sky. In the image, composed with 30 hours of narrowband image data, it spans nearly three full moons toward the royal constellation Cepheus. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula&#8217;s bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue-green emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, a more recent investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Orin the Red, as the character is known, is a magical, shape-shifting menace. A sexy but sadistic presence who will appear time and time again through the game - towards the latter parts of it - to test your resolve.

The video is a short primer on what the titular Pikmin are and how they can be used in-game. The overview follows a new traveller as they meet the Pikmin and learn how to work with them.

The traveller looks on in confusion at various points, before a Pikmin confidently approaches them and instructs them to blow their whistle, or launch it towards a task to do, which got a chuckle out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yuji Naka, Sonic's co-creator and the man behind ill-fated platformer Balan Wonderworld, has been found guilty of insider trading, but will avoid prison for now.


Naka was first arrested back in November 2022 following reports of alleged insider trading at Square Enix. He pleaded guilty in March, and then, in June, the developer was sentenced to serve two and a half years in jail, with a final judgement in July.


At this time, Naka was additionally fined twice for ¥2.5m and ¥170m (just under £1m total), with his defence seeking a suspended sentence and to lower the fines. They claimed Naka "accidentally saw information that was extremely unrelated to [his] work". However, prosecutors said Naka "showed no signs of remorse" for his actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4's first season will go live on 20th July, with the promise of a new boss battle, questline and gear to get your hands on. 


Known as Season of the Malignant, this season will introduce the fittingly named Malignant Monsters. These monsters are described by Blizzard as "decaying abominations" that roam through Sanctuary in a frenzy. They will not hesitate to attack anyone or anything that gets in their way. 


A new questline will focus on sorting these new foes out, with Cormond, a former priest of the Cathedral of Light, helping you on your way. He will train you to "capture the Malignant hearts" that are the source of the monsters' power, and "convert them into build-altering powers".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The steady drip of Mortal Kombat 1 info continues in the run-up to the sort-of-rebooted fighter's 19th September launch, with developer NetherRealm having now confirmed Smoke and Rain as playable characters, alongside some familiar faces returning as assistive Kameos.


Not including today's announcements, NetherRealm has so-far confirmed a total of 10 playable characters for Mortal Kombat 1: Johnny Cage, Kenshi, Kitana, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Mileena, Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung (available via pre-order), and Sub-Zero.


Two more additions have now been revealed as part of NetherRealm's latest Kombat Kast livestream. Assassin-turned-cyborg Smoke is in, marking his first playable appearance in the main series since 2011's Mortal Kombat reboot. He's joined by moody demi-god Rain, who hasn't been benched quite so long, having appeared in Mortal Kombat 11 as a DLC character.

Speaking to GameReactor at the recent Gamelab conference in Barcelona, Molyneux was reluctant to give many firm details of the game or this idea to avoid - in his words - people subsequently getting "very annoyed and angry" when their expectations of Molyneux's words are met with reality.


"In days gone by, I would just start telling you about the whole game and the whole game design and why it was going to be the most brilliant game in the world," Molyneux said. "I'm not going to do that."

Sakurai made the comments in the latest episode of Game Concepts, a series on his YouTube channel in which he discusses the development of various games.
Uprising released in 2012 for the 3DS and is the third game in the Kid Icarus series, released 21 years after the previous title Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters. A future release in the series, whether in the form of a sequel or re-release, "seems difficult", Sakurai has said.

You can now play the game for one hour, which will give you a little taster of what's in store for protagonist Jacob Lee as he negotiates the perils of the galactic prison facility he finds himself in on Jovian moon Callisto.


It is a shorter trial than previous PlayStation Plus offerings, with the likes of God of War Ragnarök giving players three hours of gameplay, but still a nice addition to the service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashback, the classic 16-bit sci-fi platformer from Delphine Software, is, as you probably already know, getting a sequel before the end of 2023, some 31 years after its original release. And new developer Microids has now offered a fresh look at Flashback 2's action - specifically the jungle-y bits - in a new trailer as it prepares for a November release.


The original Flashback, which arrived to much acclaim back in 1992 - when everything was still in black and white, and computers were powered by magic - followed the far-flung future adventures of agent Conrad B. Hart on the trail of shapeshifting aliens attempting to infiltrate human society. It was an investigation that, much like Delphine's earlier Another World, took the form of a strikingly rotoscoped platform-puzzler.


Flashback 2 (which, somewhat confusingly, isn't technically the game's first sequel, given the existence of 1995's 3D follow-up Fade to Black) sees Conrad B. Hart return for more sci-fi adventure - somewhere in the 22nd century - as he goes in search of his friend Ian. Again.

Gun announced an end for Friday the 13th: The Game back in June, confirming the asymmetrical multiplayer horror would be pulled from stores on 31st December this year, the same day its Friday the 13th licence officially expires. There's some small solace for owners, however, in that the studio has promised the game will remain playable through "at least" 31st December 2024.


And now, it's announced some new measures that, while primarily designed to "reduce the dependence on database servers", will also allow players to go about their merry slaughtering and killer-evading survival in chaotically maxed-out fashion.

And now, thanks to a new leak, we've got a good idea of when EA Sports FC will likley be showing up - which, unsurprisingly, is pretty much slap bang in the same late-September slot FIFA has occupied for the last few years.


According to data miner billbil-kun - who has a amassed a pretty compelling back catalogue of accurate calls when it comes to video game leaks (Sony's monthly PlayStation Plus line-up being a particular specialty) - EA Sports FC will release on 29th September this year.


Given that FIFA 2023 and the series entry before it both launched on 27th September in their respective release years, it's hardly a huge surprise to learn EA's new FIFA-in-all-but-name game will follow suit, but it does give us an intriguing window to watch as we prepare to see how EA Sports FC will fair without its familiar branding.

This option appears to be an alternative to the more involved Discovery Tour mode that popped up some time post-launch in Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. Perhaps befitting Mirage's more condensed nature, this option too sounds less involved.


Appropriately titled the "History of Baghdad", the option is described as being similar to the series' traditional Codex, and has been built in partnership with a series of museums and international historical institutions.

Speaking out just a couple of weeks after the origins of Destiny's space golf ball The Traveller were finally revealed - to a somewhat mixed response - Bungie staff have defended Destiny's storytelling techniques, and said players should not expect to make allies with the game's villainous Hive.


"The Hive has still committed a lot of, you know, genocide," senior narrative designer Robert Brookes told Dexerto, pouring cold water on the Guardians and the Hive suddenly becoming besties.

Yes, that's right. If you head over to the eShop right now, you can get your hands on The Last Hope - Dead Zone Survival, an "intense storyline game set in an apocalyptic world overrun by hordes of ravenous zombies". Launched on 30th June, it normally costs £8.99 but is currently on sale for just 99p. 


Having played The Last Hope myself, I would advise saving your pennies for something more worthwhile. Toothpicks, perhaps. You can see a trailer for The Last Hope below (and if you were still interested in playing the game afterwards, please note there are spoilers for The Last Hope below).

The update, which became available yesterday, fixes issues relating to certain quests and various other bugs but unfortunately also prevents players from being able to make money quickly.

The methods previously reported on Eurogamer, one using thrown weapons and another using frozen meat, now do not work in version 1.2.0 of the game. I've tested this myself, and am grateful I already cashed in 40k before I updated my version.

The Butcher, an infamous enemy from the first game, can randomly spawn in any dungeon, at any level, and is a particularly nasty foe to defeat.


Reddit user IronHeart_777 discovered a giant "beast of a Butcher" while running nightmare dungeons with friends, but don't worry - it's not actually a new version of the enemy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Wildcard's less-than-elegant rollout of Ark: Survival Ascended, a full-price remaster of its 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved, continues with the news of a delay from August to October this year, and word it'll now launch without its first bit of remastered DLC.


Ark: Survival Ascended has already had a bumpy start to life; the remaster first surfaced when Studio Wildcard announced it'd be taking Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers offline later this year, and that the only way to continue using official servers would be to purchase its new Unreal Engine 5 remaster - only available as part of a bundle with the now-delayed Ark 2. Following an outcry from players, Studio Wildcard eventually announced it would scrap the bundle, instead replacing it with a standalone version of Ark: Survival Ascended that was - amazingly - exactly the same price, despite featuring one less game.


It's in this context that Studio Wildcard has now announced a delay for Ascended, saying it has "found it challenging working with Unreal Engine 5.2".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a court filing submitted as part of its legal battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed Activision Blizzard aquisition, Microsoft has claimed Sony is "expected to release" both a PlayStation 5 Slim and a "handheld version of the PS5" before the end of this year.


Both machines were referenced during a paragraph (as spotted by IGN) intended to demonstrate that Nintendo's Switch should not - as the FTC is arguing - be considered in a separate market to Xbox and PlayStation based on price. It's a point Microsoft is determined to prove so it can more effectively assert its stated position as the underdog in the console market.


As part of its argument, Microsoft notes the Xbox Series S is $50 cheaper than Switch's OLED model in the US, with the $399.99 PS5 Digital Edition being just $50 more. It's here the company first makes reference to an unannounced Sony machine, claiming the latter is "expected to release a PlayStation 5 Slim later this year at the same reduced price point."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games, Apple has submitted a filing requesting the Supreme Court overthrows a 2021 ruling made by the US district court of California, which upheld a complaint against Apple's anti-steering practices.


Epic launched its lawsuit against Apple in August 2020, following the iPhone maker's decision to revoke Epic's Fortnite developer account, preventing the battle royale game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees.


As that case reached its conclusion, California's Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in all but one of its 10 claims. However, the one ruling made in Epic's favour - that Apple cannot block developers from linking out to alternative payment methods from within their apps (a practice known as "anti-steering") - has remained a sticking point for the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Have you ever been on a crowded train with one of your best gay friends and, inside, a tiny part of you is cringing because he is being so gay?"
That's a question posed by my favourite drag queen and Ireland's self-proclaimed gender discombobulator, Panti Bliss, in a biting speech about "checking" herself. What she's "checking" is something most queer people "check" for in public, whether they realise it or not: their own queerness. Am I standing too gay? What about these colourful socks? Are they too much? Will holding a partner's arm in public turn into a problem? Something private and intimate altered into something shameful or political, all through other people's reactions. 


That feeling's best thought of as the tension between who people expect us to be and who we really are... or who we're trying to become. Imagined futures are projected onto our bodies like film reels, blurring the skin that lies beneath. That tension feels a lot like shame. But, while video games usually have all the subtlety of a sledgehammer busting through a wall, they're occasionally a great place to explore queer topics, letting us role-play as whoever we want to be or explore those unique experiences in unique ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has cancelled development of its long-in-the-works Just Cause mobile game, which had been available in regional early access - but never fully launched - since November 2021.


Just Cause: Mobile was unveiled in December 2020, during The Game Awards, where it was billed as a free-to-play action shooter set in the Just Cause universe, featuring single-player, four-player co-op, and 30-person competitive multiplayer modes.


It was originally set to launch in 2021, and, did, eventually get a release in Singapore - albeit only as regional early access title - before the year was through. Since then, Just Cause: Mobile's early access has spread to a number of other countries but development has been repeatedly hit by delays, culminating in an indefinite delay toward the end of last year and, in February, the termination of all regional early access programmes.

The developer was given a second chance to resubmit their game but said, via Reddit, that this was also rejected - due to them not owning the necessary rights. 


Now, in a statement provided to Eurogamer, Valve has clarified a few points on this post, and provided further insight into how it will police AI-generated content on Steam in general.

A fresh rating for Red Dead Redemption via the leaky Korean Ratings Board popped up last week, setting tongues wagging that Rockstar had quietly submitted a fresh version of its cowboy classic to be approved for release.


Details of that listing pointed to a new console version of the game (thanks, Gematsu), rather than anything only for PC.

These five are reportedly part of a group of "scavengers", who are said to be "surviving on the outskirts of a post apocalyptic city", and using a Victorian house as their base.

It's unclear if the code includes any subsequent patches – although the .34 part of the 1.34 title certainly suggests so – and some commenters who've presumably downloaded and run the code believe the code is "not complete, but close".

As spotted by Dexerto (via PC Gamer), the bans come after gambling site CSGOEmpire published a spreadsheet of CS:GO traders it believed were part of a cryptocurrency money laundering scheme allegedly operating through a rival gambling site called CSGORoll. 

Whilst Valve has yet to comment on whether or not the bans were connected to the details revealed in the spreadsheet, it seems as though all but one of the accounts leaked on the spreadsheet have now been banned.

Right now the details are scarce, but Techland popped up on Twitter to inform fans that it was "joining forces" with Skybound's The Walking Dead for a new event in which you'll get to "survive, scavenge, and slay the undead like never before".

"We know a thing or two about fighting the undead," the official Twitter account for The Walking Dead responded, although neither account told us what the event will entail, nor when we can expect to play it – we've just been asked to "stay tuned for more info".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last of Diablo 4's super-rare elusive items have finally been discovered in the wild.

Last week, Diablo 4's lead class designer, Adam Jackson, jumped online to "clear up" the confusion around some of Diable 4's rarest unique items, and it's from Jackson that we learned the names of the six rarest ones: Andariel's Visage, Doombringer, Harlequin Crest, Melted Heart of Selig, Ring of Starless Skies, and The Grandfather.

Up until that point, some extraordinarily lucky players had discovered five of the six items, but the most elusive one, Melted Heart of Selig, was still the stuff of legend… until yesterday, it seems, when the item finally dropped for a Chinese necromancer.

"Can Jala learn to love herself and heal the wounds of her past?" the video description teases, before giving us a two-minute peek at Jala's hectic world and family life, reminding some in the comments of Edgar Wright's film adaptation of Scott Pilgrim vs The World.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the second instalment of Toby Fox's reportedly seven-part "nonviolent" RPG Deltarune steadily approaching its second anniversary, fans are understandably eager to hear when more will be on the way, and while Fox mightn't be ready to divulge that particularly bit of information yet, he has now offered a development update.


Deltarune - which charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World - launched its first chapter toward the end of 2018 as a free download. A second instalment - also free - arrived in September 2021, followed by the news a third, fourth and fifth chapter will all launch simultaneously at a later date.


The big question for Deltarune fans, though, is when, and the answer, if Fox's latest progress report is anything to go by, still sounds very much like 'not any time soon'. Fox does reveal, however, the team is currently working on Chapter 3's last overworld area - and once that's done, "the chapter will finally be playable all the way through".

News that Ubisoft has finally decided to give everyone what they more or less wanted in the first place comes via Kotaku, which claims, citing two sources familiar with the publisher's plans, that the remake is "still in its earliest stages".


Ubisoft Singapore - the same studio still trying to finish the embattled Skull and Bones - is "heavily involved" with the project, which isn't expected to complete "for at least a few years".

        <updated>2023-06-30T18:19:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment, the company behind this year's critically lambasted The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, is reportedly set to exit game development and has laid off around 25 employees as part of the move. Additionally, a second Lord of the Rings game in development at the studio is said to have been cancelled.


Daedalic's The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was announced in 2019 for release in 2021, finally arrived last month, following numerous setbacks and delays. Its reception was less-than-positive, however, with Eurogamer's Christian Donlan calling it a "well-intentioned mess" in his 1 out of 5 review. It was something of a surprise, then, when reports surfaced soon after that Daedalic was currently working on a second Lord of the Rings game.


According to German website Games Wirtschaft, however, that game - which has reportedly been in the works since mid-2022 - is no more, with development now cancelled as part of Daedalic's sudden decision to shift away from development and solely into publishing following Gollum's poor reception.

Earlier this week, as part of the FTC vs Microsoft court case, internal documents were released suggesting Microsoft had at one point considered buying the Japanese company to boost its Game Pass offering.



Sega's co-chief operating officer Shuji Utsumi has now dismissed speculation the company is still open to acquisitions.

Specifically, Sony was worried about the game's popularity among children causing problems for PlayStation.


The details come from a 2022 document uncovered as part of the FTC vs Microsoft trial, spotted by Axios, in which PlayStation boss Jim Ryan discusses Roblox's absence from Sony consoles - and admits his company's stance from the game is now shifting.

The court case between Microsoft and the FTC came to a close yesterday, after several days of testimonies, revelations and Sharpie-related blunders. 


During the proceedings, Microsoft's lawyer took to the floor in a bid to clear up a bit of a misunderstanding surrounding Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. However, in doing so, they perhaps made things a touch more confusing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has once again addressed the Xbox version of its upcoming RPG Baldur's Gate 3, confirming that while it's still in the work, the developer may ultimately be forced to make "compromises" in order to release on the platform.


Larian's struggles with Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox first surfaced in February, when - amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive - the studio confirmed it was working on an Xbox version but that it had "run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op."


In a statement provided to Digital Foundry shortly after, Larian explained its decision not to formally announced an Xbox release was more specifically down to issues it was having getting "split-screen co-op to work to the same standard on both Xbox Series X and S". And now, in an interview with IGN, studio founder and creative director Swen Vincke has shared more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were first introduced to Pioneers of Pagonia, a new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich, earlier this year, there wasn't much to go on beyond a brief description and a teaser video. Now, though, with its early access release steadily drawing nearer, we've been given a first proper look at the thing via a new in-game trailer.


Pioneers of Pagonia, to get the fundamentals out the way, sets players loose on the titular (and procedurally generated) islands of Pagonia with the goal of establishing a presence through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover - and the alliances they forge with Pagonia's not always friendly inhabitants - along the way.


40 different building types have also been promised for Pioneers of Pagonia's Steam early access launch, along with more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. A co-op mode is also planned, meaning you'll be able to be a ruinous blight on the land (or otherwise, I suppose) with a friend in tow.

RoboCop: Rogue City - which is build around an "original story" set between RoboCop 2 and 3 - looks to land somewhere between a first-person shooter and cybernetically enhanced detective adventure, whisking players to the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit to solve crimes, slay baddies, and perhaps even turn a few wrong 'uns into goo.


"Explore open areas and complete your objectives according to your own sense of justice," explains Teyon. "Finding evidence, interrogation and maintaining public order are just some of your daily tasks as a police officer. But don't take decisions lightly: your choices can determine the fate of citizens and the result of your mission."

And it was a typically strong showing for the publisher, offering a fresh look at some already announced titles - including the new one from Sayonara Wild Hearts' studio Simogo and the fascinating Cocoon - as well as some big reveals. From stunning photographic adventures to an honest-to-goodness new Blade Runner game, there's a lot to look forward to in the months and year ahead, and a full round-up of the showcase can be found below.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes

Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo's latest is a baroque blend of surreal mystery thriller and puzzle adenture, faintly bringing to mind the studio's iOS classic Device 6. It focuses on a woman's search for answers, deep in a strange manor house, as players attempt to solve the enigma at its heart. There's no release date yet, but we do it's coming to Switch and Steam - and while we await further details, there's a tantilising new trailer above.

As reported by The Verge, Canada's Competition Bureau has written to Judge Corley, who is currently presiding over the FTC's Activision Blizzard case in the US, to correct certain "factual inaccuracies" in Microsoft's court filings.


Microsoft had told the court that "every single worldwide regulator that has examined the deal other than the FTC has rejected" the theory it would remove Call of Duty from PlayStation should the acquisition go through, and that all regulators agreed "withholding COD from Sony would be unprofitable and is thus not a serious concern." It also claimed "all but one foreign regulator" (namely the UK's CMA) had cleared the transaction.

The company will close its recently-released NBA All-World game, end development of its upcoming Marvel World of Heroes project, and shut down its Los Angeles development studio. The news was communicated to staff via an email from company founder John Hanke, which has now been made public.


Pokémon Go, which remains lucrative, is safe. Indeed, Hanke calls it the company's "top priority" as it slims down and refocuses on the future.

A big draw this month is Darkwood, the nightmarish survival horror game from Acid Wizard Studio, which will be available between 1st July until 31st July.

Darkwood, which originally released on PC in 2017, is a frightening horror experience that combines exploration, combat, scavenging, crafting and survival into an extremely unusual whole. Our Donlan called it "a masterclass in how to undermine the audience in tiny, gnat-bite ways" when he played it back in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we look back at a week of headlines from Microsoft's time in court arguing its case to buy Activision Blizzard with the FTC.

In the video game industry, courtroom drama does not get much bigger than this. Microsoft's Phil Spencer and Satya Nadella, Sony's Jim Ryan and Activision boss Bobby Kotick have all given evidence as the US weighs up whether to allow Xbox's enormous Call of Duty buyout to procede.
The week has brought us some eye-opening opinions from these top industry execs, as well as a treasure trove of emails to pore through - and some badly-redacted documentation. Today, we recap the biggest stories of the week, including who else was on Microsoft's studio shopping list, and why Bethesda is upset at Call of Duty not being platform exclusive. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4's time rewind feature is a big addition to the series, though I admit being apprehensive at first around how it might be deployed. After a week with the game - and you can read some of my early thoughts here - I've come to use it sparingly, but appreciate its existence.


As its name suggests, the feature allows you to skip backwards and undo any sudden calamity. Though in doing so, my initial fear was it risked devaluing the Pikmin series' usual high stakes.


After all, the frequent likelihood of imminent Pikmin death - their agonising squeals, the sad sight of their soul floating slowly upwards - acts to ensure you approach each situation with care.

Ryan, speaking in pre-recorded video testimony, also claimed other publishers "unanimously do not like Game Pass" for that reason. When pressed by Microsoft's lawyer, he added: "I talk to publishers all the time, and this is a very commonly-held view over many years by the publishers."
Talking to Eurogamer yesterday, Miles Jacobson, studio head of Sports Interactive, the Sega-owned developer of the ever-popular Football Manager series, disagreed with that quite directly.

Thanks to the retrospectively poor choice of using a Sharpie marker to redact the key information, it's easy to see the contents of these redactions now the document has been scanned.

from alpha to beta in v1.26 introduced signatures for the binary artifacts,
other projects followed the approach by providing image signatures for their
releases, too. This means that they either create the signatures within their
own CI/CD pipelines, for example by using GitHub actions, or rely on the
Kubernetes image promotion process to automatically sign the images by
proposing pull requests to the k/k8s.io repository. A requirement for
using this process is that the project is part of the kubernetes or
kubernetes-sigs GitHub organization, so that they can utilize the community
infrastructure for pushing images…]]></summary>

The Cycle: Frontier, which arrived on PC last June, sees teams of players - in the role of Prospectors - airdropping onto a hostile alien planet in order to gather resources, fend off predators and competing teams with a steadily expanding arsenal, then whizz back into space at the end with all their hard-earned spoils.


The game has seen three seasons of updates since its launch last summer, but Yager has now announced development is coming to an end, with its most recent patch being its last.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of Microsoft's court battle with US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission, emails between Xbox boss Phil Spencer and PlayStation head Jim Ryan have been revealed, outlining Microsoft's initial proposal to Sony - regarding the Activision Blizzard games it would be willing to keep on the PlayStation platform should its $69bn acquisition be approved - and Ryan's lengthy counter-proposal.


As confirmed by Phil Spencer last September, Microsoft contacted Sony shortly after the January announcement of its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, providing a signed agreement to Sony guaranteeing Call of Duty would remain on PlayStation - with feature and content parity - for "at least several more years beyond" Sony current contract.


During his FTC deposition this week, Ryan admitted he "wasn't particularly" happy with Microsoft's original proposal, but "hoped it was an opening salvo" - and we now have a more precise picture of his initial response, thanks to newly revealed emails, as spotted by The Verge's Tom Warren. In a reply dated 26th May, Ryan informed Spencer that Microsoft's proposal "did not fulfil" the objective of "ensuring Activision Blizzard games are available on PlayStation", and that the company had "serious concerns" which an enclosed counter-proposal from Sony was intended to address.

The idea was floated among Xbox top brass back in 2019 - before Square Enix sold its suite of Western studios, and before Microsoft got entangled in its current attempted $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout. 


Documents showing Microsoft's interest in acquiring Square Enix surfaced today, as the company continues to plead its case with the Federal Trade Commission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go developer Niantic has infuriated fans by reverting a positive change to the game's spawn radius that let you see Pokémon spawns from twice as far away. 


The change went live earlier this week and was praised by players. But, last night, Niantic announced via Twitter that the buff would be removed. 


Adding to the confusion is the fact that the game's community leaders - who are regularly fed information by Niantic - were allegedly told the game was working "as intended" with the spawn change applied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four Mega Drive games have joined Nintendo's Switch Online service, including two Zelda-like adventures.


The first is Landstalker, an isometric adventure developed by Climax Entertainment and released in 1993 in which players take the role of treasure hunter Nigel (no, really). Many of the team went on to develop Alundra for the PlayStation, considered something of a spiritual successor to Landstalker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has released its latest patch update for Diablo 4, which will make Nightmare dungeons easier to grind.


Experience rewards have been buffed for Nightmare Dungeons - specifically increasing the experience for both killing monsters in these dungeons and completing them - making them well suited for high level players looking to grind.


Helltide chests will also provide "substantially more bonus experience when opened", and Whispers have similarly had a significant increase in rewarded experience.

Brilliant post-apocatalyptic feline simulator Stray is among those getting the chop - just ahead of publisher Annapurna Interactive's upcoming digital showcase event, where we may see an Xbox version of the game.


Live-service game flop Marvel's Avengers is also being removed, although the game itself will still be playable if you pay and gets its final update in September.

Writing on the BioWare website, McKay explained that "most of the current team will be invited to accompany" Star Wars: The Old Republic as its development switches over to Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot studio Broadsword Online Games - a move EA previously said was necessary so BioWare could focus on its new Mass Effect and Dragon Age titles.


"Unfortunately," McKay continued, "not every role will make the move. This is the hardest part of this transition, and these decisions were not made lightly."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 5 - or Project Rene, as EA is currently calling - is still some considerable way from release, but that isn't stopping developer Maxis from showing off its early experiments exploring what this "next generation" Sims game could be - and the studio has now shared a little more as part of its latest Sims stream.


When Project Rene was officially unveiled in October last year, EA teased a game built on a foundation of "charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories" that would be designed with real-time collaboration in mind (solo play is still supported) and be simultaneously playable across a range of devices, including mobile and PC.


At the time, footage was limited to some expanded creativity tools inspired by The Sims 3's Create a Style options, but Project Rene's latest airing in EA's new Behind the Sims showcase (which also had a lot to say about horses) has gone into a little more detail about what The Sims 5 might look like if Maxis' current experiments prove fruitful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has announced a new batch of titles heading to its Apple Arcade subscription service in July, including two particularly notable oldies-but-goodies: Stardew Valley and Slay the Spire, which both arrive in '+' form, denoting they were previously available on the iOS App Store.


Stardew Valley+, as if it needs an introduction, is developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's wildly popular spin on the farm life sim genre, having now sold over 20m copies since its launch in 2016. Apple Arcade subscribers will have the opportunity to succumb to its endearing blend of agricultural wealth accumulation and pixel wooing from 28th July.


As for Slay the Spire+, it's also a bit of a modern classic. Developer Mega Crit Games' roguelike deck-building dungeon-crawler - which sees players attempting to fend off monsters and scale the titular spire with nothing but a fist of battle-ready cards - is a wonderfully refined, richly rewarding experience, and well worth seeking out.

As reported by Variety, the new series - which is being handled by Big Mouth and Star: Trek Lower Decks animation studio Titmouse - looks to be adhering closely to the core murder-and-deduction premise of its video game source material.


The show's official longline reads, "Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone. Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs."

Air Twister, which launched for Apple's Apple Arcade subscription service last June, sees players battling alien invaders through 12 stages - and across various modes including  Arcade, Turbo, and Boss Rush - to save a planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


The ensuing action is a bit Space Harrier and a bit Panzer Dragoon - at certain points players take to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and Yu Suzuki has previously said Air Twister was inspired by a fantasy shooting game he envisaged in the 80s, before pivoting toward Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

Only 16 employees remain, due to Season performing lower than expected commercially.


News of the layoffs surfaced earlier this month, but GamesIndustry.biz has since received the all-staff announcement from CEO Amélie Lamarche in full.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 arrives this October more than than 13 years after Remedy's original game, and after a number of false starts at getting the sequel made. 


Much of developer Remedy's original pitch for the sequel eventually worked its way into Alan Wake's American Nightmare, the action-heavy 2012 standalone spinoff which, while not unanimously loved by critics, went on to be one of the cult hits of the old Xbox Live Arcade days.


Remedy has continued to work on ideas for a full sequel ever since, through the period where it released Quantum Break - the Xbox One exclusive that mixed time-bending action and shooting with live-action TV episodes - and then the fellow "Remedy connected universe" entry Control.

In particular, the game will include The Eye of the Wanderer, which will allow players to pin screenshots to the map to help with exploration.


"The genre is quite dependent on being able to 'take mental notes'; remembering and visualising things like blocked paths, or situations that need tools or powers that you don't have," said senior game designer Rémi Boutin.

Earlier this year, the Hitman developer announced it was working on a "bold" new franchise. Very little else was shared, other than a tease it would feel both familiar and "unlike anything" the studio had done before. No platforms, or even a project name, were announced at this time.


However, evidence submitted in the ongoing FTC vs Microsoft trial suggests this upcoming release - known (for now) as Project Dragon - will seemingly be an Xbox console exclusive.

The email, sent to Xbox exec Tim Stuart, has publicly surfaced now during Microsoft's ongoing courtroom battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout. In it, Booty encourages Xbox to make further acquisitions to bolster Game Pass and compete with Sony.


"We (Microsoft) are in a very unique position to be able to go spend Sony out of business," Booty wrote, in reference to planned spending of spending $2-3bn in 2020 to avoid competitors getting ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's promise it would keep Call of Duty on rival console platforms after buying Activision Blizzard prompted concern within Bethesda at its highest levels, a newly-published email now shows. 


Bethesda marketing exec Pete Hines emailed bosses, including Todd Howard, to highlight the approach Microsoft was taking with Activision in order to court regulatory approval and note that it was "the opposite" of what Bethesda itself had just been "asked (told) to do" with its own games. 


The email, dated 2nd October last year, expresses concern that Bethesda would be publicly questioned on why games like Starfield are Xbox-only following Microsoft's acquisition, as opposed to future incarnations of Call of Duty after Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Microsoft's court battle with US antitrust agency the FTC rumbles on, more and more juicy snippets of behind-closed-doors business doings are beginning to surface via released internal documents, and today's minor revelation comes via the news that Microsoft reportedly gave serious consideration to buying Sega - and other companies including Bungie and IO Interactive - to help it accelerate Xbox Game Pass.


This little bit of what-might-have-been comes via internal Microsoft documents spotted by The Verge, beginning with an email from Xbox boss Phil Spencer to CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, requesting strategy approval to approach Sega Sammy about a potential acquisition of its Sega games division.


Spencer suggested Sega's "well-balanced portfolio of games across segments with global geographic appeal" would help Microsoft "accelerate Xbox Game Pass both on and off-console", and that Sega's "beloved IP" would be particularly effective in helping Games Pass reach new audiences in Asia, "where localised content is critical to success".

Meta Quest+ isn't quite the Game Pass or PlayStation Plus Extra-style smorgasbord you might be envisaging, however; instead, it'll give subscribers access to two "handpicked VR titles" each month from a selection of Quest's "biggest hits, hidden gems, and back-catalog classics".


Meta Quest+ is available to Quest 2 and Quest Pro users, and costs £7.99/$7.99 USD a month or £59.99/$59.99 annually - a savings of over 37%, Meta notes. Curious sorts can get their first month's subscription for £1/$1 as long as they sign up before 31st July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Closing in on four year since its announcement, Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot is still nowhere to be seen, and a new report claims a succession of unfortunate setbacks has lead to "little meaningful progress" on the project since its 2020 unveiling.


When Microsoft revealed its Perfect Dark reboot for Xbox during The Game Awards in December 2020, it confirmed the project was being developed by The Initiative, the Santa Monica-based studio founded by Crystal Dynamics veteran Darrell Gallagher.


Since then, sporadic reports have suggested something of a tumultuous journey for the project; Crystal Dynamics was brought in to assist The Initiative in September 2021, game director Dan Neuburger departed the studio in March last year, and an exodus of over 30 key staff was reported shortly after - causing head of Microsoft Studios Matt Booty to insist the game wasn't in trouble during a panel talk in September 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in May, from an FAQ provided by developer Remedy, Alan Wake 2 will only have a digital release when it launches on October 17th later this year, with "no plans" for a physical release on disc at the time.
This has naturally sparked some concern among certain fans, with digital-only downloads posing issues for both game preservation, as shown by the closure of the Nintendo 3DS eShop in March this year, as well as ownership rights, exemplified by the infamously de-listed survival horror spinoff PT.
Speaking to Eurogamer at Summer Games Fest earlier this month, Alan Wake 2's creative director Sam Lake and game director Kyle Rowley gave us a little more detail on the reasoning behind going digital-only, explaining that, actually, it was to allow Remedy more time to polish the game to an acceptable level - something publisher Epic Games had also been on board with.

As spotted by Timo653 over on Reddit, developers such as series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and producer Daisuke Sato - who both left Sega several years ago to form Nagoshi Studio, a subsidiary of NetEase Games - are no longer credited for their work on the games. 


Meanwhile, the entirety of Lab42 (which worked on 0 and Kiwami 1, helping to bring these games to PC) and QLOC (which worked on Kiwami 2 to 6) have also seen their credits removed.

Born by way of an internet urban legend in 2009, Slender Man has popped up in many fan-made and indie horror games, but his most notable in-game appearances include Slender: The Eight Pages in 2012 and 2013's Slender: The Arrival before a highly-publicised stabbing incident and moral panic saw the fictional entity go dark for several years.

In a statement, the studio defined what it believed datamining to be – the practice of "extracting information from massive datasets" and "illegal infiltration of in-game code and databases in order to extract information that is intentionally hidden from users" – and said that "in-game accounts involved in datamining and/or sharing data originating from datamining" will be banned, and "further actions taken afterwards".

"Throughout the past few years, there was an increase of datamined information circling around various websites as well as accounts on social media," the team explains. "While some players believe that the developers of Escape from Tarkov are not sharing information about hidden changes of the game, we also would like to remind that any data retrieval without official permission is a direct breach of [...] the license agreement."

That's according to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who recently confirmed that the latest instalment of the highly-anticipated RPG series was still "five-plus years away".

As reported by Axios' Stephen Totilo – who had been live-tweeting the outcomes from day two of the US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)/Microsoft court case all yesterday – Spencer was "asked a lot" about how Microsoft decides platform exclusivity, with much of the questioning framed around Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax.

Mortal Kombat 1's stress test – a finite testing period designed to "deliberately stress [NetherRealm's] online infrastructure and identify potential issues" ahead of its launch later this year – is currently underway.
 As the test is private and open only to pre-selected players, scalpers are trying their luck and flogging their codes, even though the test is free and only running this weekend, closing at 4pm BST/8am PDT on Monday, 26th June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's almost time for American Truck Simulator to cross over a new state line as SCS Software readies its new Oklahoma expansion for release - and in the run-up to its arrival, the studio has shared a soothing 15-minute drive through its digital reimagining of the Sooner State.


Oklahoma will be American Truck Simulator's 13th explorable state when it makes its eventual debut - it joins California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas - and promises a tour of "wonderful state parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends."


You can get a brief taste of the expansion's highways, byways, and sweeping vistas in SCS Software's newly released Oklahoma gameplay preview trailer below - which, as ever, is basically video game ASMR, so dim the lights, grab a pillow, and let your cares drift away amid the gentle murmur of digital wheels on digital tarmac.

It all started after Twitter user Nitroid began poking around the Metal Gear portal website and noticed a spot of oddness with Konami's updated Metal Gear timeline.


The gist of the discovery is that Konami's revised graphic featured a number of inactive buttons for old games pointing to new pages, leading to speculation that these particular titles - Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and Metal Gear Solid 5 - were being primed for a re-release as part of a Master Collection Vol. 2.

Speaking to Eurogamer, Remedy boss Sam Lake revealed he had "really, really, desperately wanted" to be able to open the game with a quote from King himself - whose style matches much of the spooky supernatural horror that follows.

A special birthday update for Sonic Frontiers has been on the cards for some time now, having been announced as part of an expansive post-launch support roadmap at the end of last year. Now, however, with Sonic's big day finally here, we've got a clearer idea of what it'll bring.


For starters, the ordinarily rather drab world of Sonic Frontiers gets a splash of birthday cheer, festooned with the likes of balloons, wrapping paper, and other decor. Additionally, there's a jaunty party hat outfit for Sonic so everyone can properly get in the mood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has at last served up some backstory for The Traveller, Destiny's long-running space moon/golfball thing which has been floating above Earth for much of the past decade. 


Destiny 1, which launched almost nine years ago, introduced The Traveller as a mysterious dormant entity that previously held magical powers, as well as the ability to hold back the ominous-sounding Darkness. 


Where had it come from? What were the nature of its powers? Was the Traveller actually a bad guy? I remember wondering all of these things as I looked up at the orb from Destiny's first Tower hub.

Rumours that McConaughey, along with Mahershala Ali, were both in talks for the part were discussed by Josh Horowitz on his Happy Sad Confused podcast (thanks IGN). Here, The Last of Us' TV showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed he had spoken with McConaughey about playing Joel.


"I actually never talked to Mahershala," he confirmed. "I did talk to Matthew. I wouldn't say that it was serious, it was more of just like, 'Hey, here's something we can talk about'."

The message, sent by PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, was quoted in court by Xbox last night as the US Federal Trade Commission began its hearing into Microsoft's attempted $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout.


"It is not an exclusivity play at all," Ryan wrote in an email to former PlayStation Europe boss Chris Deering. "They're thinking bigger than that.

Earlier this month, the developer confirmed the game would be moving to a third-party studio so BioWare can focus its efforts on the forthcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and future Mass Effect game.


Fans have since been concerned about the future of The Old Republic, but a new forum post from executive producer Keith Kanneg lays out the future of the game, and notes BioWare is currently helping with "planning for 2024 and 2025".

ORIGINAL STORY 10.11pm: Following the shock cancellation of this year's E3 back in March, new details shared by the Los Angeles City Tourism Department suggest the games industry trade show won't be making a comeback anytime soon, with shows scheduled for 2024 and 2025 now also seemingly cancelled.


As spotted by Restera, the Entertainment Software Association, which owns E3, had initially booked the Los Angeles Convention Centre for the weeks beginning 11th June 2024 and 3rd June 2025 - dates shared as part of a Los Angeles City Tourism Department report last October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why, it's horse, of course! As widely expected thanks to a few cheeky leaks earlier this week, The Sims 4 is ushering in a new age of the equine for its next paid expansion; Horse Ranch, as the release is known, arrives on 20th July for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


Horse Ranch's primary focus is Chestnut Ridge, a new rustic prairie world inspired by the American West. Here, players can live out an idyllic life - either in a traditional country cabin or in something with a few more mod cons - caring for mini goats, mini sheep, and, of course, horses, which can be rescued, bred, purchased, customised, and raised from foals.


Sims not afraid to get their hands dirty have plenty of options on the ranch, from mucking out horse beds to harvesting prairie grass for the animal feeder, and it's even possible to brew moonsh... sorry, Nectar, by smashing up fruit and veg then ageing the results on Nectar racks ready for sale. There's also sheep shearing, goat milking, and other animal interactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking during today's FTC hearing, Bethesda's Pete Hines has confirmed the company's upcoming Indiana Jones game will be exclusive to Xbox and PC, with the court being told a multi-console contract was amended following the company's acquisition by Microsoft.


Bethesda announced its Indiana Jones game back in January 2021, confirming it was being developed by Wolfenstein studio MachineGames. However, it failed to make mention of the platforms it would target, a notable omission at the time given Microsoft's then-impending $7.5bn USD acquisition of Bethesda and Zenimax.


Little has been heard of the game since that initial reveal, but it's now burst back into the spotlight in something of an unexpected way - during a witness testimony from Bethesda's head of global publishing Pete Hines, as part of US antitrust agency the FTC's court proceedings to secure an injunction to block Microsoft's $69bn Activision Blizzard deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just three years after its much-heralded arrival, Activision is pulling the plug on the original Call of Duty: Warzone. The free-to-play battle royale shooter set to go offline on 21st September.


Call of Duty: Warzone launched along Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2020, but was renamed Warzone Caldera after the arrival of its similarly styled successor, Warzone 2.0, last November.


Warzone Caldera has remained available in the months since then - meaning players have been able to continue using real-money purchases including skins and weapons unavailable in 2.0 - but now Activision has signalled the end is in sight for the original experience, warning that all progression, inventories, and online services will "expire" in September.

As part of a (heavily redacted) court filing intended to supplement the five-day case, Microsoft has once again attempted to portray itself the underdog in the console market.

For Nintendo, yesterday's online extravaganza acted like a shot of adrenaline to Switch's aging heart. There had been questions around how much Nintendo might still have for Switch, post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Now we have answers - and a release schedule busier than either Microsoft or Sony's for the remainder of 2023. Switch 2 certainly now feels even longer away.
Microsoft, meanwhile, took advantage of the Elephant Mario in the room to announce it's long-suspected price rises for Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Series X. It was an oppurtune moment for Microsoft to deliver the bad news, with the value of Game Pass demonstrated last week at its well-receieved Xbox Game Showcase. Still, was it really necessary? Or could it just get away with it because PlayStation blinked first? Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch has launched a new Hype Chat feature to allow viewers pay to have messages pinned at the top of the chat window.


The main aim is to provide a new way for viewer messages to stand out in a busy, fast moving chat, as well as an additional method for streamers to make money.


Messages can be purchased from $1 to $500 (with streamers able to set a minimum up to $100) and the duration, character count, and visual design of the pin will depend on the amount spent. Twitch will take a 30 percent cut of revenue earned.

">official collaboration with Microsoft to officially bring Excel into sci-fi MMO Eve Online. Excel spreadsheets are a popular way for players to manage the huge amounts of data gained whilst overseeing and expanding their space assets.

At the beginning of this year, CCP Games announced its year-long roadmap for the game, where it stated its aim to launch Excel integration in May for Omega subscribers.

The Excel add-in is now free to use for all players, after launching yesterday. Eve's API is used to import player data, meaning no programming knowledge is required.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Past Within, developer Rusty Lake's wonderfully sinister time-travelling co-op puzzler, is ready to make the jump to a new platform, and will be launching for Switch on 6th July.


The Past Within is the latest in a series that has so far spanned 15 loosely interconnected games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banners, with another one - the recently announced Underground Blossom - expected to arrive on PC later this year.


Like its predecessors, The Past Within delivers a deliciously surreal mix of casual point-and-click puzzling and room escape action, albeit this time given a devious co-operative twist.

        <updated>2023-06-22T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Action roguelike Midautumn is named after the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the most important events of the calendar for many countries in Asia. It's a celebration of the full moon, usually falling in September or October, though traditions vary between countries. For me, it's a time of year I'll always associate with the mooncakes my grandma shares with us. For Midautumn developer Sherveen Uduwana, it brings back memories of attending these festivals as a child, and the comfort of lanterns and fireworks floating in the dark night sky.


Available in demo form during LudoNarraCon last month, Midautumn's blend of thematic storytelling and action mechanics immediately caught my eye - as well as its name. Still, Uduwana is aware Midautumn's title - and the experiences within Asian diaspora communities that inspired him - won't immediately feel familiar to many others. "I think a lot of folks I was pitching it to were like, why is it called Midautumn?" Uduwana tells me, adding that he settled on the name very early on. "There's a specific type of person who, when they find out the game is called Midautumn, gets very excited."


Uduwana tried pitching the game in a traditional way to secure funding, but the culture gap - and then, more significantly, the pandemic and the wave of anti-Asian sentiment surrounding it - caused him to opt for a more indie development approach instead. "That galvanised me to just be like, I'm just gonna message people and we'll try and make it," he says. "I was tired of having to explain why people would relate to it, or why it would be something that would be exciting for folks. A lot of people in those positions of power are just not really tuned into those specific communities."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roblox, the hugely-popular game platform used by millions of younger players, has introduced a 17+ age category for experiences aimed at older audiences. 


Current categories exist for All Ages, 9+ and 13+, and Roblox has traditionally been seen as a place popular for children to play. 


But Roblox's audience is growing older - a natural step as the game matures in age and retains players as it does so - and 38 percent of Roblox's most active users were 17 and older in 2022, Roblox has said, making it the game's fastest-growing age group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has said that Sony would no longer be able to share details of its upcoming console hardware with Call of Duty maker Activision, if Microsoft's proposed $68.7bn buyout was approved by regulators.


Speaking to the US Federal Trade Commission, which is currently involved in legal proceedings to block the deal, Ryan said Sony "simply could not run the risk of a company that was owned by a direct competitor having access to that information".


Ryan's comments date from April this year, when the FTC questioned the PlayStation CEO on statements submitted by Sony designed to give its perspective on the deal. Chief among those is the worry by Sony that its game development processes would be interrupted as it "could no longer share confidential details about its next console in development".

This Friday more specifically marks 32 years since Sonic's western debut on Sega Mega Drive, which technically (if I have my hedgehog lore right) means he'll be celebrating his 47th birthday given his age in the first game. So before his back gives out completely, Sega will presumably be keen to shove as many announcement out as possible.


Friday's Sonic Central, then, is promising a "sneak peek of some of our upcoming projects, partnerships, and events happening in 2023".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tadayoshi Kohno, Yasemin Acar, and Wulf Loh wrote excellent paper on ethical thinking within the computer security community: &#8220;<a href="https://securityethics.cs.washington.edu/ComputerSecurityTrolleyProblems.pdf">Ethical Frameworks and Computer Security Trolley Problems: Foundations for Conversation</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The computer security research community regularly tackles ethical questions. The field of ethics / moral philosophy has for centuries considered what it means to be &#8220;morally good&#8221; or at least &#8220;morally allowed / acceptable.&#8221; Among philosophy&#8217;s contributions are (1) frameworks for evaluating the morality of actions&#8212;including the well-established consequentialist and deontological frameworks&#8212;and (2) scenarios (like trolley problems) featuring moral dilemmas that can facilitate discussion about and intellectual inquiry into different perspectives on moral reasoning and decision-making. In a classic trolley problem, consequentialist and deontological analyses may render different opinions. In this research, we explicitly make and explore connections between moral questions in computer security research and ethics / moral philosophy through the creation and analysis of trolley problem-like computer security-themed moral dilemmas and, in doing so, we seek to contribute to conversations among security researchers about the morality of security research-related decisions. We explicitly do not seek to define what is morally right or wrong, nor do we argue for one framework over another. Indeed, the consequentialist and deontological frameworks that we center, in addition to coming to different conclusions for our scenarios, have significant limitations. Instead, by offering our scenarios and by comparing two different approaches to ethics, we strive to contribute to how the computer security research field considers and converses about ethical questions, especially when there are different perspectives on what is morally right or acceptable. Our vision is for this work to be broadly useful to the computer security community, including to researchers as they embark on (or choose not to embark on), conduct, and write about their research, to program committees as they evaluate submissions, and to educators as they teach about computer security and ethics...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo's Switch slate was looking a little bare bones for the rest of 2023.


But after today's Nintendo Direct we have a much clearer picture of what's still to come, with a look at Pikmin 4 headlining the showcase, plus reveals of a Super Mario RPG remake and a brand new 2D Mario game.


First, though, Nintendo showed a fresh look at the forthcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC heading to Switch later this year.

Wave five will arrive this summer, complete with a new course known as Squeaky Clean Sprint. 


From what we can see in the trailer, this course looks to be taking us around a sud-filled bathroom, with plenty of bubbles and bottles to negotiate. It will be joined by another seven courses, which are yet to be announced.

At first glance, Super Mario Bros. Wonder's presentation is all very New Super Mario, with its crisp, clean lines - albeit this time slightly stylised - and familiar Mario motifs. But then, midway through its announcement trailer, Mario encounters a new power-up and things get weird.


Warp pipes come alive in wiggly choreography, heaving and bending all over the place; spherical cows come tumbling in; Mario - and the world around him - gets a new stretchy, silhouetted look, and here come mega-herds of adorable sheep!

Several developers have flirted with this new technology, with the likes of Ubisoft announcing its Ghostwriter AI tool earlier this year. Meanwhile, the High on Life team used AI to create video game voice dialogue.


Last week, I had the opportunity to chat with voice actors Jennifer Hale and David Hayter about their upcoming release, Synapse, and during this conversation, the topic of AI came up.


"I have been staying on top of it," Hale assured me when I asked about the actors' personal take on the matter. "And the number one thing I want to say to everybody out there is: Stay out of fear. Stay in action."

The first Pikmin introduced the world to Captain Olimar and his titular half-plant, half-animal pals back on GameCube in 2001. A sequel followed in 2004, expanding on the original's real-time strategy style puzzling with new Pikmin, cave exploration, and more.


Since then, both titles have received gentle updates for Wii, introducing a pointer-style control system. However, it's not entirely clear which editions of Pikmin 1 & 2 are coming to Switch, with Nintendo only referring to them as "HD versions".

Details are still incredibly sparse. The short teaser showed the platform's Princess Toadstool making her way along a rather fairytale-looking street set on a theatre stage. Then she made a tree burst into bloom to open a door, all thanks to a nifty use of magic. 


She then magically changed from her standard pink dress into something a little more dazzling, and the trailer ends.

Earlier this month, the FTC succeeded in getting a temporary ban placed on Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout bid. Now, ahead of an upcoming hearing regarding the agency's request for a preliminary injunction, the FTC has submitted further documentation on the matter.


In a new and heavily redacted filing, the FTC has refered back to Microsoft's acquisition of ZeniMax and Bethesda. The company stated Microsoft's decision to make ZeniMax games exclusive is "powerful evidence of incentive to foreclosure".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has released another patch for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor across PC and consoles. 


This patch addresses a variety of issues, including fixes for crashes and such. Your standard update fare. Additionally, this patch includes a fix for bounty hunting progression and introduces improved blaster handling.


However, the patch note that really caught my attention - "The training dummy on Jedha was sneaking around. It has now been immobilised". Sorry buddy, today marks the end of your sneaking adventures. You shall now remain tethered in place for all our Jedi training needs.

However, plenty of fans have been positively clamouring for their heavily rumoured arrival - and it looks like EA has finally relented, teasing they'll be coming very soon.


The Sims 4 developer Maxis has been on something of a fan-pleasing crusade of late; last year marked the long-awaited return of werewolves, for instance, alongside more robust options for Sims teens, while 2023 has bought babies back in a big way.

"These steps will accelerate our business, drive growth, and deliver long-term value for our people, our players and our communities," Wilson added.

Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope received an extremely positive critical reception when it launched last October, with many praising the smart refinements it bought its predecessor's already wonderfully engaging strategic core.


Its commercial reception was far more muted, however; in an emergency investor call held at the start of the year to share news of its considerably lower-than- expected earnings, Ubisoft admitted it had been "surprised" by Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope's "underperformance in the final weeks of 2022 and early January".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has quietly updated its Final Fantasy racer Chocobo GP on Switch as a complete package.


Back in December, the company announced an end to "large scale updates" for the game nine months after its release. This included the removal of its in-game mythril shop (in January) used for microtransactions.



The game has an updated release date in the eShop (31st May 2023 in the UK store), seemingly related to the Chocobo GP Lite version of the game that no longer exists.

Blood in Baldur's Gate is a murder mystery which sets players the task of finding out who has killed an elf. The game takes place on a map of the lower part of Baldur's Gate, where players can select locations to visit and investigate.

Each day, players can vote on where to head next and whichever location gets the most votes will be made available. The game updates every weekday, and Larian has stated the game will run for the next three weeks.

This includes the game's split-screen multiplayer mode - a long-standing feature of the series since Pikmin 2 - and what looks like the ability for a second player to aid you in the game's main campaign via some kind of targeting reticule.


Environments shown off here appear to include the interior of a house - a dramatic departure for the series which has so far stayed outside (or underground). And yes, spoilers for Pikmin 1, the series is indeed set on Earth.

This is Us actress Melanie Liburd, who stars in Alan Wake 2 as its new co-protagonist, had been due to appear at one point, Keighley said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Next Fest, Valve's semi-regular celebration of gaming things to come, is back for another week of developer chats, livestreams, and an intimidating stack of "hundreds" of demos likely to thwart even the most committed completionist.


Proceedings are now firmly underway, continuing until next Monday 26th June, and Valve has provided a full list of available demos and livestreams for those eager to dive right in. But should decision paralysis strike, you'll find a few potentially promising places to start - based on some of the games Eurogamer has been harbouring mounting excitement for in recent times - below.


The list is far from exhaustive, of course, and all the games I've included are largely known quantities - it'll take a lot more poking around Valve's subterranean depths before Steam Next Fest's latest batch of hidden gems reveals itself. But in the meantime, while the poking continues, perhaps the following will provide some initial inspiration - and if anything catches your eye as you do your own deeper delving, feel free to share in the comments.

The glitch is relatively simple and requires a couple of weapons, some raw meat, and at least 57 Zonaite. It should be replicable in versions of the game up to 1.1.2, which is the version I tested it on and can confirm it works.

If you want a video guide to follow, the earliest video I can find of the glitch is from YouTube channel No Hypothesis. YouTuber Austin John Plays has a thorough guide too, in which he notes where things could go wrong.

Cavill was speaking at Netflix's Global Fan Event, Tudum over the weekend. There, the actor was joined on stage by fellow Witcher stars Freya Allan, Anya Chalotra, and Joey Batey to discuss the show's upcoming third season, which will apparently feature "a very shocking death". Also, those of us who have not read the books are going to be "blown away" by season three's "big bad". 


But, of course, what most people wanted to hear about was Cavill's departure from the show, something he announced towards the end of last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has revealed that the "significant majority" of players have yet to complete Diablo 4. 

That's according to Diablo 4's game director, Joe Shely, who confirmed on a recent fireside chat that whilst it may feel as though players are rocketing through the story campaign, the truth is that most players are taking their time, albeit "playing through content much more quickly".

"The significant majority of our players haven't finished the game yet," Shely said in the livestreamed discussion. "But many of the people who are watching this stream, and our dedicated players, play through content much more quickly and have been experiencing this situation with the dungeons."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The film studio behind the Super Mario Bros. Movie has moved to shut down reports it is making a Legend of Zelda film next.

Earlier this month, it was reported that animation studio Illumination was on the cusp of finalising a "big deal" with Nintendo to adapt its Legend of Zelda series. However, Illumination's CEO has now spoken out to damp down fan expectation.


Speaking to The Wrap, Chris Meledandri - who founded Illumination back in 2007 - said he didn't know where this Legend of Zelda report came from.

The original Moving Out arrived back in 2020, reimagining the process of furniture removals in much the same chaotic way Overcooked reimagined culinary creation. And while the end result wasn't "quite as good" as its obvious inspiration, as Eurogamer's Christian Donlan suggested in his review at the time, it was "still very special".


A extremely solid foundation, then, for more to come, and Moving Out 2 builds on the original by whisking the Furniture Arrangement and Relocation Technicians (F.A.R.Ts) "beyond the realms of their dimension" and into a succession of "wildly different" universes.

Not much has been heard from Houser since his departure from Rockstar following an "extended break", but rumblings of a return emerged last year when it was discovered he'd registered companies Absurd Ventures and Absurd Ventures in Games in both the US and UK.


And now, Houser's new project has been officially revealed, with Absurd Ventures being described as a media company with a focus on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium".

Booty shared the news in conversation with Axios, revealing all 23 of Microsoft's internal Xbox studios - aside from those specifically working on support for ongoing games like Minecraft and Sea of Thieves - have now "moved on to Gen 9". 


Despite that shift in focus, Booty says the company still plans to "maintain support" for Xbox One by making its Gen 9 titles - that is, games designed specifically for Xbox Series X/S - playable on the older platform via its cloud streaming technology.

The first Guacamelee (technically styled Guacamelee!, but the exclamation mark is a bit much), released in 2013, serving up a colourful mix of wrestling-inspired brawling and non-linear exploratory action, in which protagonist Juan Aguacate, suddenly infused with luchador powers, set out across a fantasy world inspired traditional Mexican culture and folklore to rescue El Presidente's kidnapped daughter.


"Like the best luchadores in the business," Eurogamer's Christian Donlan wrote at the time of its release, "Guacamelee has real heart and a blazing desire to put on a good show."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A logo seemingly pointing to an unannounced remaster of Square Enix's sci-fi action-RPG sequel Star Ocean: The Second Story has been discovered on the publisher's website.


The unassuming asset in question, found squirrelled away on Square Enix's support site (and which you can peruse at your leisure over on RPGSite), features a logo for a presumably unannounced title going by the name Star Ocean: The Second Story R.


While Square is yet to utter the name publicly, it's not hard to conclude it references an unannounced remaster, given it uses the same naming convention as Star Ocean: First Departure R. That game, which released for Switch and PlayStation in 2019, was a remaster of 1998 PlayStation Portable game Star Ocean: First Departure (itself a remaster of the 1996 Super Famicom original), introducing the likes of difficulty rebalancing and new character art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released, players have been flexing their creative muscles by building a host of weird and wacky designs. This has included mechs, trucks, tanks and Korok torture devices. Someone even built a pilotable T-rex, because why not.


A month on, however, these in-game designs have evolved even further, and we are seeing Zonai-crafted orchestras and functioning calculators turn up in the game. 


As a quick reminder, Link's new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects to create something completely new and unique.

Aired at 5am UK time, the 11-minute video offers little in the way of actual updates amongst its silliness. We get another trailer for the upcoming Shadows of the Damned Remastered and, right at the end, the sneakiest of peeks at what's next from renowned game maker Suda51.


Looking closely at the gameplay footage (which Suda51 pretends to block to stop us seeing more), there's a UI which shows health, blood and "emerald flowsion". One of the weapons equipped is named "Brynhildr".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times is beta testing a game called Connections which has gained attention for its similarities to a round featured in BBC2 quiz show Only Connect.


In both games, players are shown 16 clues which must be categorised into four groups of four. Once a category is correctly identified, the clues are grouped together at the top of the board and asasigned a colour.


The only notable difference is that Connections refreshes each day and players can only make four mistakes (akin to Wordle), whilst in the Connecting Wall (as it's known on Only Connect) players must solve the wall in two and a half minutes. Connecting Wall players have unlimited guesses until they've found two categories, after which they are only given three incorrect attempts.

This update sees the arrival of a redesigned in-game overlay, complete with new features, a notes function, pinnable in-game windows and improvements to notifications.


The ability to pin windows from the overlay means they appear on top of a game while you are still playing. This feature, the company has said, is available for Notes, Guides, Discussions, Achievements, and the web browser, so  is ideal for those "multi-tasking maniacs who love to have a movie on in the background while they game".

It's certainly raised some eyebrows among fans.

Speaking with Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation's head of subscriptions Nick Maguire said putting games on to the service "a bit later in the life cycle" is working for Sony. Therefore, this will "continue to be [its] strategy moving forward."


"We're happy with our strategy," Maguire told the publication. "Putting games in a bit later in the life cycle has meant that we can reach more customers 12, 18, 24 months after they have released."

When Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth was revealed at last week's Xbox Games Showcase, many (myself included) believed it was a completely new game being announced in the series, and not the sequel to 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon. 

However, following subtle rewording of its marketing for the game, RGG Studio and publisher Sega explained that Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is actually the title for Like a Dragon 8, which was initially announced under that name in September last year.

The test is open to Xbox Series X/S and PS5 players in North America, Latin America, Brazil, and Europe, but places are limited. Participants will be chosen at random from those who've registered on the Warner Bros. website, and registration is still open if you want to get involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, here's a surprise! Just when it looked like it would be all hands on deck until the arrival of Sea of Thieves' hugely anticipated (by me, I am the huge anticipant) Monkey Island crossover, developer Rare has announced it'll be reviving the multiplayer pirate game's limited-time Adventure series next week after a three-month absence.


Sea of Thieves' Adventures were introduced early last year in an effort to create meatier, more interesting monthly content drops, with the idea being each would form a playable instalment in an ongoing narrative. It's been fun following along, even if their quality has varied wildly (and even if they resulted in the sacrifice of moustachioed seahunk Arthur Pendragon, which is a crime I will never forgive), but then Rare suddenly announced it would be temporarily "hitting the pause button" on Adventures back in March.


Whatever the reason for the pause (presumably the impending arrival of a certain G-brush), Rare is finally ready to resume monthly Adventures, starting with next week's A Dark Deception, which runs from Thursday, 22nd June to Thursday, 6th July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People Can Fly, the studio behind Bullestorm and Ourtriders, has formally signed a work-for-hire agreement with Microsoft to develop a new project based on one of the Xbox maker's IP.


The announcement come via a statement posted to Polish financial site Interia Biznes, in which People Can Fly notes the game, which has been given the codename Project Maverick, will be fully funded by Microsoft with a budget of $30m-50m.


As to what the mystery project could be, the most obvious guess would be some form of new entry in the Gears of War series given the studio's previous connections with the franchise - it co-developed Gears of War: Judgment alongside its previous owner Epic Games in 2013, and was responsible for the Windows port of the original Gears of War prior to that.

The series is the work of Paris-based animation studio Bobbypills - the team behind Dead Cells' animated trailers, as well as Ubisoft's upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon spinoff, Captain Laserhawk - and whisks viewers away to a cursed island ravaged by a strange plague. 


"After the island's foolish king develops a remedy that ends up turning the population into monstrous creatures," the official announcement explains, "prophecies depicting a flame-headed hero begin to appear. As it so happens this beheaded hero is real, but saving a kingdom isn't on his schedule and he just wants to be left alone."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a year since Sony relaunched its PlayStation Plus subscription service with multiple tiers, and today there's word of an upcoming new feature: PS5 game streaming.


There's no release date as yet, just word that Sony is "testing" the technology for select PS5 titles, including those in the subscription's game catalogue, and others you may own. 


And to be clear, this will be a Premium tier benefit - so you won't get it if you're on regular old PlayStation Plus Essential or Extra.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I liked the look of Last Train Home when it got its unveiling this week during not-E3. It's a wintery period piece from Czech studio Ashborne Games, based on real events following World War 1. 


With the Great War over, you command a legion of Czech soldiers on a train bound for home via the Trans-Siberian railway. Their aim is to get back to the newly-created republic, but along the way there's trouble - the Russian Civil War.


Real-time battles are interspersed with management of your soldiers while aboard the train - which can of course be upgraded as you journey through Siberia - making sure your units are in good health and well fed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida previously told Eurogamer that Game of Thrones was a major influence on the upcoming game - something that's now apparent from the many references to the series already obvious from the game's freshly-released demo.
"We wanted to create something that really resonated with a lot of people," Yoshida said previously. "And when we saw how Game of Thrones, and before that the Song of Ice and Fire series, has really resonated with players, we knew that this was something that we wanted to do as well."


The development team were required to watch the Game of Thrones Blu-ray boxset in order to keep the series' style front-of-mind - something that is now apparent more than ever. Did George RR Martin secretly pop over to the Square Enix office while writing lore sheets for Elden Ring?
