        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back 4 Blood developers turtle Rock Studios has given players a brief look at its upcoming second expansion.

Although the team said it would "love" to confirm the release date, it needed "a bit more time" but served up a single new screenshot - you can see it in the embedded tweet below; there's a cult, body parts, and some strange symbols daubed around the place - to whet our collective appetites. 

It also teased that the new expansion will probably include Act 5 with some clever word play on Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt - the publisher behind studio CD Projekt Red, developer of The Witcher games and, of course, Cyberpunk 2077 - has seen its share value plummet by over 75 per cent.

That's according to Business Insider Poland, which says that the disastrous launch of Cyberpunk 2077 has wiped the value of the then most-valuable games company in Europe from over 40 billion Polish złoty - that's around £7.11bn - to less than zł10 billion - about £1.77bn.

The drop in CD Projekt's value - whilst still remaining one of Poland's most valuable companies - reportedly takes it back to a value last seen around 2017.

Six more heroes have had their abilities tweaked in a bid to rebalance the game ahead of its formal release, including Doomfist, Junker Queen, Orisa, Sojourn, Symmetra, and Zenyatta.

Doomfist's changes include minimum damage required to empower Rocket Punch reduced from 100 to 90 damage, and the movement speed penalty while blocking reduced from 50 to 35 per cent. They will also now deal damage to all enemies knocked back "instead of only the first target impacted".

The issue first popped up on the game's subreddit, with dozens of players complaining that items had been "auto-purchased" when previewing them in Fall Guys' in-game store.

Other issues included Show Bucks going mysteriously missing, hidden key bindings triggering purchases, items being switched after selection, and "a lot of players" finding that they inexplicably have "less currency now".

Research firm NPD Group - which originally asserted Elden Ring was one of the top 10 best-selling games in history before retracting the claim due to "incomplete data" - reports in an updated statement that From Software's action RPG has "placed first in dollar sales in four of its first five months in market", is the best-selling game of June 2022, and remains "the best-selling game of 2022 year to date".

"Elden Ring repeated as the best-selling game of the month, and it remains the best-selling game of 2022 year to date," NPD said in the revised statement. "Elden Ring has placed first in dollar sales in four of its first five months in market."

Sony announced it would buy Bungie for $3.6bn back in February. At the time, Sony boss Jim Ryan stated the purchase was "an important step in [Sony's] strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a much wider audience".

Despite a probe by the FTC that sought to review "the latest example of how aggressive the agency is becoming in reviewing mergers", the agreement has now formally "closed" and Sony has posted across its social media channels to "officially" welcome Bungie to "the PlayStation family".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves' long-long-long-awaited Captaincy Update, first discussed prior to the game's release all the way back in 2018, will miss its planned launch later this month and is now due to arrive alongside Season Seven on 4th August.
In its originally envisaged 2018 guise, the Captaincy Update was an early victim of Sea of Thieves' rocky launch, with Rare ultimately making the decision to place it "on the back burner" while it refocused its development plans. Most assumed it was lost to time after that, but, to everyone's surprise, it suddenly resurfaced during Microsoft's not-E3 showcase this June.
This new iteration of Captaincy follows the same basic premise of the originally teased update, introducing a host of new features designed around the idea of becoming the captain of your own distinctive vessel. These will include the ability to name your ship, decorate its cabin, earn unique rewards, make use of special new cash-in points across the ocean, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up until now, The Sims 4 has presented itself as an enthusisatically flexi-sexual world, where every Sim is open to at least considering all attempts to woo and WooHoo. That'll soon change, however, with an imminent update giving The Sims 4 players the opportunity to define their Sims' sexual orientations in a way that better reflects the real world.


Arriving as part of a free update accompanying The Sims 4's next major expansion, High School Years, which launches on 28th July, the feature will add a new Sexual Orientation tab to the game's Create-A-Sim screen. Here, player will have the opportunity to tinker with three settings that will impact how Sims interact with others in-game.


The first option enables players to choose whether a Sim is romantically attracted to men, women, both, or neither, meaning they'll turn down romantic advances made by Sims that don't fit that profile. Incidentally, while discussing the feature during its latest livestream, developer Maxis explained it's currently using gender binary terms (despite making strides to add more inclusive pronoun options) for technical reasons relating to how The Sims 4, which is built on eight-year-old architecture, currently handles gender behind the scenes. It notes, however, that it hopes to expand the feature to encompass more gender identities over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has detailed a long-lost title from Totally Games, the developer best remembered for its work on the X-Wing series. Known as Knights of Decayden, it was planned as an early exclusive for the original Xbox before its cancellation and subsequent fade into obscurity.


Totally Games was, of course, a big deal back in the 1990s, having made a name for itself with LucasArts' hugely popular series of Star Wars space shooters, which included the likes of X-Wing, Tie Fighter, and X-Wing Alliance. Sadly, the studio closed in 2015, following a string of critically and commercially disappointing releases - but fans will likely get a kick out of a new Axios report detailing a fantasy flight combat game the developer was working on in partnership with Microsoft at the height of its success.


Knights of Decayden (other titles reportedly included alternative spelling Knights of Decadyn and Project Archipelago) was initially pitched to Sony under the name Knights of Utu for release on PS2, but eventually found its way under Microsoft's wing, with the plan being to release it as an Xbox exclusive in the year following the fledgling console's 2001 launch.

Karpyshyn served as lead writer for Mass Effect 1 and 2, though left BioWare part-way through the second game's development. 


Discussing the trilogy in a new reddit AMA, Karpyshyn said that when he was in the Mass Effect 2 writers room, BioWare had "some very ideas planned out".

Riccitiello raised eyebrows when discussing developers who don't prioritise monetisation as part of their creative process.


"It's a very small portion of the gaming industry that works that way," Riccitiello told PocketGamer.biz, "and some of these people are my favorite people in the world to fight with - they're the most beautiful and pure, brilliant people. They're also some of the biggest fucking idiots."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pre-orders are now open for the many different editions of God of War Ragnarök - the most expensive of which, the Jotnar Edition, is priced at £230. This includes lots of fancy physical items and a digital code for the game - but no disc.


As detailed last week, Ragnarök will be available in four separate editions upon launch in November. 


Slightly less expensive, and also without a disc, the God of War Ragnarök Collector's Edition costs £180. The Digital Deluxe edition costs £80 - as you might expect from the name, there's no disc there either. Finally, a standard digital/disc copy of the game costs £70 on PS5, or £60 on PS4 (where there's a £10 upgrade option).

Details on the new venture - currently being referred to as "Aliens" - are pretty scarce right now, with Survios only saying it'll feature an original storyline set somewhere between the events of Alien and Aliens, with players taking on the role of a "battle hardened veteran [with] a vendetta against the Xenomorphs".


Given Survios' background as a primarily VR-focused developer - it's worked on the likes of Creed: Rise to Glory, The Walking Dead Onslaught, and Puzzle Bobble 3D: Vacation Odyssey - it won't be much of a surprise to hear its new Aliens project is also be getting the VR treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans eagerly awaited fresh news of EA's highly-anticipated new Skate game have been given their wish, but it mighn't be quite what they were expecting. EA and developer Full Circle have shared a new 18-minute video, announcing, among other things, that their long-awaited skateboarding revival will be a free-to-play live-service game.


Despite having variously been known as both Skate 4 and a Skate reboot since its development was announced in 2020, Full Circle now says the game "isn't a sequel, it's not a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel." Instead, it's described as an "authentic evolution" of the series - one whose last mainline entry arrived 12 years ago - that reflects "where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world".


Full Circle also dropped an official name in the form of "Skate." (that fullstop is here to stay it seems), and a new setting in San Vansterdam - described as a sister city to previous games' San Vanelona.

Resurgence (not to be confused with Heartland, Ubisoft's upcoming free-to-play Division game for PC and consoles), will, like other entries in the series, be an open-world third-person shooter RPG set in post-crisis America - in this case, Manhattan - following a deadly virus outbreak.


It does promises a fresh story campaign, in which players once again take on the role of an agent allied to the Strategic Homeland, delivering a "new perspective on key story events".

To add a cherry on top, Jairus handed over the launcher to "Master Chief" who fired it at a lake on the back of a Mongoose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - also available in audio form! - it's all about Nintendo Switch, which is quietly having yet another brilliant year.

The last few days have seen confirmation of a new Kirby game and a Bayonetta 3 release date (finally!), adding to a solid year so far and a strong end to 2022 which will also see the likes of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Splatoon 3, Mario Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It's a bumper crop - especially compared to this year's lack of first-party launches on PlayStation and - most of all - Xbox.

At the same time, the way Nintendo is detailing these games is changing. Notably, there's been no big E3 week Nintendo Direct this year, as the company keeps information on Zelda and Metroid under wraps. Is this leading to an even bigger 2023 - perhaps with new Switch hardware too? Eurogamer's Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Ishraq Subhan discuss.

<blockquote><p>The findings, which NJIT researchers will present at the Usenix Security Symposium in Boston next month, show how an attacker who tricks someone into loading a malicious website can determine whether that visitor controls a particular public identifier, like an email address or social media account, thus linking the visitor to a piece of potentially personal data.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, the page can capture your IP address, but this doesn&#8217;t necessarily give the site owner enough information to individually identify you. Instead, the hack analyzes subtle features of a potential target&#8217;s browser activity to determine whether they are logged into an account for an array of services, from YouTube and Dropbox to Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and more. Plus the attacks work against every major browser, including the anonymity-focused Tor Browser...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

That's according to producer Naoki Yoshida speaking to Famitsu (and translated by VGC) in an extensive new interview on the game.


"I'm from a generation that grew up with command and turn-based RPGs," said Yoshida. "I think I understand how interesting and immersive it can be. On the other hand, for the past decade or so, I've seen quite a number of opinions saying 'I don't understand the attraction of selecting commands in video games'.

According to preliminary data analysed by research firm Gartner, sales fell by 12.6 percent year-on-year to 72.01m units. 


Gartner puts the decline down to three main causes: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis caused by inflation and steep downturn in demand for Chromebooks.

It was initially due to launch into early access on 8th February this year, but Iron Galaxy opted to delay its release indefinitely, saying "there's more we want to do to perfect the experience."

There's no confirmed release date yet for Sega fans in other countries - presumably the name will be changed to Mega Drive Mini 2 as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortality: An Interactive Movie Trilogy - the upcoming Hollywood-inspired  investigative horror game from Her Story and Telling Lies creator Sam Barlow - has been delayed until 30th August to "ensure the experience is as polished as possible".


Immortality, which was initially due to launch on 26th July, tells the story of Marissa Marcel, a (fictional) actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.


As with Barlow's previous titles, it's a story presented in non-linear fashion that players must slowly piece together themselves by scouring through reams of FMV video. But while Her Story featured faux police interview footage and Telling Lies chose "hacked" webcam video as its medium of choice, Immortality asks players to dig through an archive of film and behind-the-scenes footage - using a machine resembling an old-fashioned Moviola editing device - to find out what happened to Marissa Marcel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge - the critically acclaimed, retro-inspired beat-em-up from developer Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu has shifted over 1m copies since it launched a little under a month ago in June.


Shredder's Revenge has, of course, gone down a storm since its release on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Eurogamer's Christian Donlan was just one of many to be won over by its charmingly reinvigorated classic side-scrolling brawling action (which comes with a bunch of pleasing mod-cons, including online co-op support for up to six players), calling it a "wonderful thing, colourful, pacey, and filled with perfect Turtles music."


Clearly, with Shredder's Revenge having now officially surpassed the 1m sales mark - as announced on Twitter - plenty of others have equally been in the mood for Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael's retro return.

Posted to reddit by user ZeoNyph, the video replaces the models of Arcane's heroes with Mass Effect's main characters. So, in place of Arcane's sister stars Vi and Jynx, we have FemShep and Liara - a little generous to the latter perhaps, though both Liara and Jynx are associated with the colour blue.


Next up, there's brief shots of boring Kaiden Alenko swapped into the place of Jayce, fan-favourite engineer fangirl Tali in the place of Viktor, and then space bro Garrus - who as a cop gets the spot of Caitlyn.

Platinum Games' threequel was first announced nearly five years ago, and has been MIA for much of that time. Today's lengthy trailer offers us a good look at the game, however. Here it is:
"The titular Umbra Witch must face a mysterious evil using her signature guns and time-slowing Witch Time ability," Nintendo writes. "This time, invading man-made bioweapons called Homunculi find themselves in Bayonetta's crosshairs."

This includes the potential of any changes to the look of its main character, the cheerleader Juliet Starling, who spends the game slashing through hordes of zombies in a skimpy outfit. 


A new statement on the remake was posted to Twitter last night by producer Yoshimi Yasuda, in a bid to clear up fan confusion over several lines from the project's original announcement.

"While we understand you're excited to get into the game, we encourage you to be careful when downloading files from unknown sources (and remind you of the potential consequences of breaking EA's Terms of Service)," Full Circle wrote.

<blockquote><p>Taken together, this means <b>the primary digital threat for people who take abortion pills is the actual evidence of intention stored on your phone, in the form of texts, emails, and search/web history.</b> Cynthia Conti-Cook&#8217;s incredible article &#8220;<a href="https://scholarworks.law.ubalt.edu/ublr/vol50/iss1/2/">Surveilling the Digital Abortion Diary</a> details what we know now about how digital evidence has been used to prosecute women who have been pregnant. That evidence includes search engine history, as in the case of the prosecution of Latice Fisher in Mississippi. As Conti-Cook says, Ms. Fisher &#8220;conduct[ed] internet searches, including how to induce a miscarriage, &#8216;buy abortion pills, mifepristone online, misoprostol online,&#8217; and &#8216;buy misoprostol abortion pill online,'&#8221; and then purchased misoprostol online. Those searches were the evidence that she intentionally induced a miscarriage. Text messages are also often used in prosecutions, as they were in the prosecution of Purvi Patel, also discussed in Conti-Cook&#8217;s article...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

We are excited to announce the v0.5.0 release of Gateway API. For the first

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The co-op flight test for Halo Infinite is still due out this week, according to community manager Brian Jarrard.


Many players expected it to launch yesterday, 11th July, but it's still not live. It should still arrive this week, though.


"The team is still working on our upcoming Halo Infinite network co-op Insider flight build. While we always said our 'target was the week of July 11', many sites reported it simply as 'starting July 11.' Still hoping for this week, but it will not start today," tweeted Jarrard yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When was the last time you played a game on Facebook? Well, Meta is hoping to tempt you back to its platform with an interesting prospect: a daily, choice-based narrative experience taking place over the course of the next four months, titled The Walking Dead: Last Mile.


A massively interactive live event (MILE), the project is a collaboration between publisher Genvid, which specialises in these part-game, part-interactive stream, part-live show creations, with design and narrative input from The Walking Dead's team at Skybound and funding from Facebook.


The big sell is that Last Mile is a new chapter of The Walking Dead's lore, which will unfold across the next couple of months based upon decisions made by players, with the resulting narrative becoming franchise "canon" in line with the original comic books.  And for fans of Telltale's The Walking Dead games, there's a clear influence in art style and design language, if not gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new novel based in the Halo universe is coming to stores on 9th August.
This book, which is called Halo: The Rubicon Protocol, will act as a prequel to Halo Infinite and tells of the six months before Master Chief wakes up and the game's campaign begins.
It sounds like this will offer up some useful bits of background information for those who started Halo Infinite and found themselves a touch confused by what exactly was going on. While some of this history can be picked up in-game thanks to some well-placed audio logs, it could definitely be made clearer for players from the off.

Along with this new mod for The Elder Scrolls 5, the Together team has also shared a little update about its purpose. Calling it a "passion project" by a small handful of volunteers, the developer revealed it had tested it out with "30+ players", although this did not strictly make it an MMO. 
"The aim of the mod is to develop a true Skyrim multiplayer experience that brings online multiplayer into this otherwise strictly single player game," the Together team explained, stating it is aimed for use by two to eight players at a time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Low sales of the Wii U weren't the only reason Nintendo decided to not offer dual GamePad support on its somewhat underwhelming console. The decision was also due to a general lack of suitable games to actually make its implementation worthwhile, former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has said.
Speaking to MinnMax, Fils-Aimé stated: 
"What was interesting is that with the Wii U, there was a full development plan for all of the interesting interactions and all of the interesting capabilities that the system could do, and so in that case, technically could multiple gamepads communicate with a Wii U? Answer was 'yes', but the install base never got large enough that that type of implementation made sense."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Professional gamer Philip "ImperialHal" Dosen hit the headlines this weekend after he held off from shooting an opponent in a competitive match when he realised the enemy player had been disconnected.

As spotted by Apex Legends Intel, ImperialHal was competing in the Apex Legends Global Series 2022 - a championship with a cool $2 million up for grabs - when he spied a lone player off in the distance. After monitoring them for a couple of seconds, he told his TSM teammates: "Dont shoot him. Don't shoot him, bro! He's crashed".

In a tweet on his personal Twitter account, Robert Morrison - whose credits also include Resident Evil 7, Injustice 2, and Santa Monica Studios' 2018 God of War reboot - countered such claims by insisting it is "the most meticiously built and crafted project" that's had "the highest level of care and attention to detail possible".

Animator Morrison - who worked on The Last of Us Part 1 and now works at fellow Sony studio, Bend - said: "Actually, it’s the most meticulously built and crafted project that I have ever seen or been a part of in my entire career.

Whilst not quite as impactful as the last patch, the game's Steam page explains how the update hopes to address "exploits and stability issues".

The long bulletpointed list includes mostly quality of life (QoL) fixes, but some new game server settings will now enable server operator to "limit the amount of processing time the gamer server can spend on processing packets for each client per tick". Clients that send packets causing server CPU processing time to exceed the configured number of milliseconds will be kicked.

Known only as "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title", the game is clearly in the very early stages, but already the team is looking to bring a host of new developers on to what seems to be a singleplayer shooter that will be a "brand new Respawn single-player adventure".

Respawn's careers page, first noticed by Dextero, is currently hiring for numerous projects, including Apex Legends, its Mobile equivalent, the upcoming Star Wars FPS, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Fallen Order's recently announced sequel. But also included in the list is that Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title, too.

As for Nintendo Switch? Sato reportedly didn't expand on that, only saying that there would be “differences” in the resolution and FPS on Nintendo's handheld system.

In a blog on the official website, Blizzard said that the team has been hard at work "compiling player feedback, [and] squashing bugs", and revealed that part of this will be revisiting Mercy's changes in light of fan feedback.

Healer Mercy received some minor nerfs when the beta test kicked off, such as her character automatically launching into the air when reaching an ally. Now, however, Blizzard is changing it so that you can decide if and when to jump… even though it seems as though that particular ability was a complete accident in the first place.

According to ResetEra's BlackBate - a mysterious poster who's correctly leaked games ahead of schedule before - it looks like subscribers to Sony's top two PS+ tiers will see the following games join the collection: Stray (which ties in with what we already knew), FFVII Remake Intergrade + FF7R EPISODE INTERmission, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, Assassin's Creed Unity, Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered, Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry, Assassin's Creed The Ezio Collection, and Saints Row IV: Re-Elected.

BlackBate reckons the games will join the PS Plus library on 19th July - yes, Stray's release date - and states that these are only "some of the games", perhaps hinting there are more to come.

Megill's CV is an impressive one, featuring story-rich games such as Control - for which she was also narrative lead - Dishonored: Death of the Outsider, and Ubisoft's upcoming Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

In a brief update posted yesterday on the official website, Blizzard said it would now treat the MOBA in a "manner similar to our other longstanding games, StarCraft and StarCraft II" by continuing seasonal rolls and hero rotations, but with no plans for new "for-purchase content to be added".

As a thank you to all who've stuck with the game, Blizzard is offering the "incredibly rare" Epic Arcane Lizard mount to all players with next week’s patch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Ineractive has given us a first look at the new level coming to Hitman 3, known as Ambrose Island.
Agent 47 is certainly not one to stay put for long, and he is now readying himself for his next holiday (sorry, I mean mission). While many of us can only dream of having the opportunity to see the world as readily as he does, for Agent 47 this is all just part of a standard day. So, what of his next destination? 
Well, once you set yours and 47's feet onto the tropical isles of Ambrose Island you will most definitely be stepping into dangerous territory. In fact, you will be stepping into pirate territory. So, you had better get ready for your buckles to be swashed. You can check out the new reveal trailer below.

It's bad news for Red Dead Online players, who have for some time complained the game had been underserved and overlooked by Rockstar in comparison to the more lucrative GTA Online. 


Now, Rockstar has laid out its plan to keep Red Dead Online on life support and acknowledged its greater focus on GTA6.

A new trailer for the upcoming release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has given us all a closer look at gameplay. Here, we see the titular Gollum scaling walls, skulking in the shrubbery, and popping off orcs with rocks. 
We also get to have a closer look at some of the other characters from Middle-earth. These include Gandalf and the elven king Thranduil, a mysterious new elf (who I suspect may be Mel from the preview I was invited to earlier this year), the Nazgûl and the eight-legged wonder Shelob. You can check it out for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the heels of The Quarry, another horror-filled game from Supermassive is coming our way. This time, we're heading back to its Dark Pictures series, with The Devil in Me.
A new trailer for this upcoming release has given us two things. The first is a launch window of this autumn. The second is an unnerving look at the game's Saw-like story, which sees a group of film makers make their way to to a replica of the 'Murder House' of HH Holmes, America's first serial killer. Obviously, things are not going to go smoothly for our group of intrepid young'uns.
Unlike previous entries in its Dark Pictures series, The Devil in Me does not appear going down the paranormal or supernatural route. Rather, it looks to be rooted in a pretty grim but very believable reality akin to the aforementioned Saw and the Hostel series of films. There are traps for our unsuspecting victims to trigger, there're torture rooms, there is tension, and there are some creepy-as mannequins. You can see for yourself below.

Originally launched in 2000, this pocket monster puzzler plays similarly to Panel de Pon, albeit with tiles themed around Pokémon types.


Perhaps my favourite thing about it is the game's heavily influence from the early days of the Pokémon anime - so expect appearances and slightly distorted sound clips from Ash, Misty, Brock and Team Rocket as you clear tiles. Here's a refresher:

<blockquote><p>Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE’s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has ­ without any judicial, legislative or public oversight ­ reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been six years since that initial summer of Pokémon Go, where we all wandered around hunting Vaporeon and the world seemed a sunnier place. 


To celebrate this latest anniversary, Pokémon Go maker Niantic has released another of its annual celebratory artworks - which regularly tease what the next 12 months may bring. 


Pokémon fans have been poring over the image, though the most noticable additions here are two brand-new characters - potentially the game's next two NPCs.

The detail was dropped rather unexpectedly last night, as part of an official Xbox Twitch livestream for the game featuring streamer Frank "Techniq" Ellerbe and Marvel's Avengers lead designer Brian Waggoner. 


In an off-the-cuff comment, Ellerbe claimed his acting coach was actually the voice of She-Hulk in the game, to the obvious surprise of Waggoner - who stated that the character had not yet been officially confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games had plans to release a remaster of both Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto 4, a new report has claimed. 
However, in light of the pretty poor reception following its GTA trilogy release last year (yes, I am being generous here), the company has now apparently put these ideas to one side.
Sources with knowledge of Rockstar's inner workings have now confirmed to Kotaku that recent rumours to this effect were indeed true, and we were meant to be getting a shiny new upgrade for both games. Last year's release of the GTA trilogy came as a real blow to Rockstar, however, and now the company is hoping to put all of that bad press behind it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a three-year hiatus due to Covid, Pokémon Go's in-person Go Fests have properly returned. The first of three music festival-sized city gatherings took place this weekend in Berlin and went off smoothly, with the usual mix of rare creatures, boosted Shiny chances and early access to new species.


As ever, it was the feeling of playing Pokémon Go among thousands of others that made the event something special. Along the many pretty paths circling Berlin's beautiful Britzer Garden, thousands of Pokémon players plodded along in groups, with friends or in couples, celebrating rare catches or looking on in envy. 


I wasn't certain about Berlin as a choice for Go Fest, after the smaller German city of Dortmund hosted the game's main European events in previous years so successfully. Not only did Dortmund have a great city park to play in, but its main centre was small enough that when Pokémon Go players turned up, they absolutely took over - fans flooding its small squares and filling restaurant terraces. It created a carnival atmosphere, and seeing the expressions of bemused locals as dozens of people passed by in Pikachu onesies never got old.

However, an extra run of the game's Blade Wolf DLC was offered as a charity donation goal incentive, but Mekarazium has since admitted this run was faked using pre-recorded footage, as PCGamesN reported.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We will no longer be getting any Xbox 360 games included with Games with Gold as of this October. 
This is due to the fact that Microsoft has now "reached the limit of [its] ability" for adding new Xbox 360 games to the service, Microsoft stated in an email to customers seen by Eurogamer. 
All is not lost though, as we will still be getting the usual monthly offering of Xbox One games.

The sale of games, consoles and subscription services contributed to a enormous $191bn global total in 2021, which will fall slightly to $188bn this year, according to Ampere Analysis. 


This follows extraordinary growth through the early stages of the pandemic, with a leap in spending especially noticable from 2020 onwards.

They have since shared a compilation of the incredible inclusions from Naughty Dog, many of which can be easily missed on your average playthrough. I am talking about things like Joel's buttons being embossed with the words "Naughty Button" or being able to spot Tess' bite before she reveals her infection.

The stunt in question comes from the 1971 film Diamonds are Forever, where Sean Connery's Bond tips his vehicle onto two wheels to get through a tight gap (something those in pursuit are, of course, unable to pull off). 
"We actually prototyped doing that [during A Thief's End's jeep chase]," Uncharted 4's co-lead designer Kurt Margenau reflected during a recent chat with Couch Soup. However, as those who have played the game will know, this idea did not ultimately make the final cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has shared the opening credit sequence for its upcoming anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.
First debuted at the Anime Expo 2022 in Los Angeles, these opening credits are accompanied by Franz Ferdinand's 'This Fffire' from 2004. (A small spot of trivia for your next pub quiz, this is not the only piece of game-inspired media to feature this song. The earlier released and self-produced 'This Fire' can also be found on the soundtrack from Burnout 3: Takedown.)
Anyway, I digress. Back to Edgerunners, and its new credit sequence which you can check out for yourself below.

In less than 24 hours, we got the news that Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert was no longer going to talk about the upcoming release of Return to Monkey Island following online abuse, and God of War Ragnarök's producer had to ask everyone to remain patient while waiting for more news on the game.
It has since transpired that some members of the gaming community have even been sending unsolicited pictures of their private parts to members of the God of War Ragnarök team. They somehow believed that this would suddenly make Sony Santa Monica give the world an update on the game's release date... How they came to this conclusion is beyond me.
Since all of this has happened, prominent members from the industry have been making their voices heard and have called out the toxic behaviour of these so-called fans.

Hard at work for more than a year on a major update. This update will be released on September 13th.
"On that date, owners of the game will receive a free update and enjoy the game as intended. The development studio reworked the entire game from the Art Direction to the AI and added numerous technical improvements" (via Kotaku).

As translated by VGC, Furukawa replied: "It is realistically difficult to develop new titles and remakes, including sequels, for every Nintendo game that people request, but we are very grateful and appreciate the expectations our fans have for our games."

<blockquote><p>So far, researchers from Lumen Technologies&#8217; Black Lotus Labs say they&#8217;ve identified at least 80 targets infected by the stealthy malware, including routers made by Cisco, Netgear, Asus, and DrayTek. Dubbed ZuoRAT, the remote access Trojan is part of a broader hacking campaign that has existed since at least the fourth quarter of 2020 and continues to operate.</p>
<p>The discovery of custom-built malware written for the MIPS architecture and compiled for small-office and home-office routers is significant, particularly given its range of capabilities. Its ability to enumerate all devices connected to an infected router and collect the DNS lookups and network traffic they send and receive and remain undetected is the hallmark of a highly sophisticated threat actor...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maxis continues to tick those much-requested Sims 4 features off the list as fans wait impatiently for news of the Sims 5, with the developer having now confirmed it'll finally be giving teen Sims a proper education in its newly announced High School Years Expansion Pack, due 28th July.


High School Years, which follows the release of The Sim 4's excellent Werewolves Game Pack earlier this month, does pretty much exactly what you'd assume it does based on its name, giving players the option to send teenage Sims off to Copperdale High for a few years of learning and post-class socialising with peers.


Its first big addition is the new location of Copperdale. Nestled on the banks of Lake LaSuli, this small town plays home to more than just the local high school; it also incorporates a library, the principal's lavish mansion, a thrift store/boba hangout known as ThrifTea, and an amusement park, complete with haunted house, tunnel of love, ferris wheel, and photo booth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, news broke of a modder that hacked AMD's FSR 2.0 temporal upscaling technology into Cyberpunk 2077, allowing users of non-RTX graphics cards the chance to play the game at higher frame-rates with substantially better visual quality than with FSR 1.0 upscaling. That's massive for owners of AMD GPUs, and the mod even works beautifully on Steam Deck. 
We contacted the mod's creator, the gloriously named PotatoOfDoom1337, to find out exactly how it works - and whether it means that FSR 2.0 will soon be available in a tonne of existing games. Here's the interview, edited lightly for clarity. Enjoy!

What's your background in programming and game modding? On NexusMods, it looks like you've only been creating mods since April last year?

At this café, you can purchase a selection of eats to help Kirby on his quest to free the Waddle Dees, including the Car-Mouth Cake. This cake will cost Kirby 20 coins and will recover some health. But, let's be honest, its reviving properties are not what we really love about it. What we really love is the fact that it is an adorable, edible Carby.
Now, the Kirby Café in Tokyo and Hakata in Japan has updated its menus to include a real Car-Mouth Cake for us to enjoy (I mean, if we are ever in the area).

The change was first spotted by German publication HardwareLuxx, which noticed the 256 GB and 512 GB versions of the Steam Deck now ship with either a two-lane or four-lane PCIe Gen 3 SSD. Previously, these versions all came with a faster four-lane SSD. 


Asked by PC Gamer for comment, Valve's product designer Lawrence Yang said Valve "determined  that there is no impact to performance between the two models," and there were only differences between the two drives in "extremely uncommon cases."

The original Overwatch wasn't updated to natively support the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, so there's huge expectation that the sequel will bring the latest and greatest tech features.


Beta players have reported that the game will be able to run at 120 FPS with variable refresh rate (VRR) support. That's a huge upgrade for console players who have been locked to 60 FPS on last-gen consoles.

The picture came from Bit Planet Games, the developer of Ultrawings and its follow up Ultrawings 2. It showed the PS VR2 on a black leather chair.
It wasn't much, with the set not even being in use for the photo, but it was enough to quickly catch the ever-watching eyes of the internet before the developer had a chance to remove the post without anyone noticing it. You can see it for yourself below (via Reddit).

That's according to Bloomberg, which has shared portions of an email sent to Niantic staff by the company's chief executive officer John Hanke.
In the message, Hanke is said to have blamed today's project cancellations and redundancies - which will affect around 8% of Niantic's workforce - on the company facing "a time of economic turmoil". Hanke reportedly claimed the moves would help "further streamline our operations in order to best position the company to weather any economic storms that may lie ahead."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RimWorld, developer Ludeon Studios' widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim, will finally be making the jump to consoles - some three and a half years after its full PC release - on 29th July.


RimWorld has, of course, made quite the mark on PC since its early access arrival all the way back in 2013 - partly for its wonderfully rich blend of management sim action and procedural storytelling, but equally for the way its complex systems can quickly tumble into outright debauchery, ranging from drug-fuelled cannibalism to non-consensual body harvesting.


Word that a console version of RimWorld was finally on the way arrived in March, although notably not through official channels. Instead, the port - being handled by Double Eleven Limited, which has previously helped port the likes of Minecraft Dungeons and Rust to consoles - hit headlines when it was listed as having been refused classification in Australia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Ocean: The Divine Force, the latest entry in publisher Square Enix's long-running action-RPG series, now has a release date and will be launching for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam on 27th October.


Tri-Ace, the studio that's been at the helm of the Star Ocean series since its debut in 1996, is once again handling development duties on The Divine Force, which this time follows the stories of dual protagonists Raymond, the captain of the space trading ship Ydas, and Laeticia, the princess-knight of a kingdom on the underdeveloped planet of Aster IV.


Each character offers its own story perspectives and gameplay experiences, and there's a taste of Star Ocean: The Divine Force's ensuing action in the new trailer accompanying today's news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has today unveiled a feast of fresh Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope gameplay footage, showcasing its intriguing new settings, characters and chaos.


This sequel to the excellent Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle takes place in a "whimsical" and gorgeous new galaxy, that's a curious blend of both Mario Galaxy and Rabbids universes. Within its orbit float worlds of autumnal colour, frozen snow and sandy beaches, like a Mario Galaxy game in miniature.


The story here revolves around Cursa, a dark entity that wants to absorb this hybrid galaxy's energy and capture the Sparks - cute creations that are a mix of Galaxy's Lumas and the Rabbids. It's up to Mario and his Kingdom Battle crew to save the day, now aided by Rabbid Rosalina, the punky-looking rabbid Edge, and - as we found out yesterday during the latest Nintendo Direct - Bowser himself.

The first discovery came from self-proclaimed "Switch tinkerer" OatmealDome. In this case, the modder managed to unearth some Half-Life 2 content tucked away in the Portal: Companion Collection's files.
"The entirety of Half-Life 2 (minus maps and music) is present in the ROM," they wrote via Twitter. "Likely based on the NVIDIA Shield port, with a little Xbox 360 sprinkled in."

However, at the time of writing, no further details have been given about what role any of the actors will play on the show's release (via Variety). 
MacLachlan is probably best known for his role of Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks, as well as Trey MacDougal in Sex and the City and Orson Hodge in Desperate Housewives. For the fellow parents among us, he is also the voice of Riley's father in the very good (and more than just a little bit emotional) Inside Out.

The allegation surfaced this week via a YouTube video from a channel named Upper Echelon Gamers. Titled "What Made Cyberpunk 2077 Fail - Quantic Lab?", the 14-minute video claimed the QA studio had placed junior members of its team on the project instead of seasoned veterans, and flagged too many minor bugs. 


These issues, the video claimed, impacted Quantic Lab's work and therefore the overall game.

This is the second time the switch has now occured, after Pac-Mom previously took Ms Pac-Man's place in Bandai Namco's Arcade Archives: Pac-Land earlier this year.


Again, the reason for the swap seems to be the messy legal issues surrounding ownership of Ms Pac-Man, which are the subject of a 2019 lawsuit.

After all, we had not seen a new game with Guybrush Threepwood at the fore since 2009. 
However, while we are getting a return, this may not be the start of a new wave of games based in the sun-soaked Caribbean islands. Rather, this appears to be the last one of its kind. 
Following its new gameplay trailer yesterday (see above) and the news it will be coming to the Nintendo Switch as a console first, the Return to Monkey Island developers unveiled a new website for the game. It is a great site, with playful interactive options for fans of the series, including the chance to 'chat' with series regular Stan.

Revealed during today's busy Nintendo Direct, Cyber Space is a mysterious digital realm that can be reached by uncovering ancient entrances around Starfall Islands - a cluster of landmasses incorporating Kronos Island, the lush area seen in Sonic Frontiers' divisive first trailers. 


In order to unlock the Cyber Space entrances, players will first need to earn Portal Gears by solving puzzles and completing challenges around the "open zone" map. Once in Cyber Space, they can try their hand at "traditional, fast-paced, speed running action platforming" - linear stages more in line with classic Sonic action - earning Vault Keys required to progress further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we ready to catapult with full enthusiasm into summer, Microsoft has announced July's Xbox Games with Gold, this time giving subscribers on  Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S access to Torchlight, Thrillville: Off the Rails, Beast of Maravilla Island, and Relicta.


It's not exactly a blockbuster line-up then, but there's certainly some fun to be had. Developer Runic Games' Torchlight, for instance, is an enjoyable Diablo-esque dungeon-crawler from 2009. This isn't the first time it's appeared as part of Xbox Games with Gold though (it was last available in July 2019), so it's entirely possible this one is already hanging around your library.


Thrillville: Off the Rails, meanwhile, is the 2007 sequel to Frontier Developments' Thrillville, an attempt at creating a more accessible spin on the classic theme park sim genre. "It's not complex, it's not challenging, but it's not trying to be," said Eurogamer in its review. "It's an enjoyable family game which also has appeal for retro gaming fans and drunk people."

"It's hard to imagine a Robin without a Batman," muses the masked hero, before resolving that he will figure it all out. What then unfolds is a bombastic trailer with Robin showing off his athletic prowess. This includes his various attacks and how he can use "teleportation tech from the Justice League's satellite" to "zap [himself] short distances in a fight".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Nintendo Direct highlighted an arry of third-party games coming to Nintendo Switch through the rest of this year and beyond. As expected, the showcase focused on games made by non-Nintendo companies - but there were still plenty of highlights, and several exclusives.


The show kicked off with Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak, which launches this week. A title update with yet more monsters to slay arrives in August, and has the jazzy title of Seething Bazelgeuse. Oh, and there's a demo available now.
Next was the venerable Nier Automata, PlatinumGames' acclaimed role-playing game from 2017. It's now headed to Nintendo Switch via a fresh The End of YoRHa Edition which contains previous DLC and new costumes. It launches on 6th October.

Return to Monkey Island is slated to release sometime this year, and come to consoles first via Nintendo Switch. We have been given some nice titbits of information about its upcoming release, including that it will be starting off at an amusement park (where Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge concluded), but the team has been keeping its cards close to its chest in terms of story and trailer reveals. Well, that was until now.
Today's Nintendo Direct, gave us our first look at some of the game's action, including piratical sword fights, explosive nautical combat, and what appears to be Guybrush in some kind of court (bodes well!). We also got to see some returning faces such as Elaine Marley, LeChuck, Murray the talking skull and Wally (to name but a few).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mega Man Battle Network, Capcom's turn-based take on its iconic action series, is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PC next year. 


Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be bundling some 10 games in total, with a physical release offering the full set while the digital release will be split across two volumes. There'll be extra features such as a music mode featuring some 150 songs and an art gallery containing some 1000 illustrations. 


The Mega Man Battle Network series had an extremely prolific run from 2001 to 2009 on the Game Boy Advance, and was well-received even if it was often hard to distinguish individual titles. There's no release date set for Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection beyond a vague 2023 window.

"Fallout: London is a DLC-sized mod for Bethesda's Fallout 4. As a continuation of the base game, the mod will allow the player to visit the previously unexplored post-apocalyptic environment of London," the description explains. 
This mod will be a change from the rest of the Fallout series, as it will not take place in America. The developer hopes this will allow for users to explore "new cultures which have not homogenised with their American counterparts". It will also mean that players can dive on into "pre-war European history, and the effects the Resource Wars had on the class structured society of pre-war Britain."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skyrim has been around for quite the time, with many a new edition or various mod upgrades being made available in its 10 plus years on the market. However, we now also have a mod that covers any version of Skyrim that releases even further down the line (which, let's be honest, will likely happen).
The mod in question comes from Nexus Mods user xilamonstrr and brings Skyrim's big scaly dragons into super sharp focus. I am talking about seeing all the little details, right down to each beast's scars, in much, much, higher definition. 
And, while 16k may seem a touch excessive given that most games tend to opt for 1440p, xilamonstrr has a good reason for choosing this resolution. In short, the dragons in Skyrim are huge, and therefore their textures can get stretched more than the other enemies and entities in this world.

The company has yet to officially trumpet the date, but it was live for a while on Ubisoft's store (thanks, Gematsu) ahead of today's Nintendo Direct, which is scheduled for 2pm UK time. 


Today's announcement stream is set to feature third-party games for Nintendo Switch - of which Sparks of Hope is a prime example. It seems likely we'll see this made official then.

A brief message posted to Ubisoft's Twitter last night revealed the publisher would be present at this August's Cologne-based convention, though did not detail what games might be on offer.


Ubisoft's decision comes after the recent pull-outs from Sony, Nintendo, Activision Blizzard and Take-Two, which have all chosen not to attend. Microsoft has yet to make an announcement - though it's unclear what it might bring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Nightdive Studios has announced that its critically panned remaster of Westwood Studios' classic point-and-click adventure Blade Runner will now include the well-recieved ScummVM version of the original game on Steam.


Nightdive's remaster was announced back in March 2020, but the project appeared to be on a permanent hiatus after the studio told Eurogamer it was struggling to overcome certain "obstacles". It was a bit of a surprise, then, when Nightdive's long-awaited Enhanced Edition of Blade Runner resurfaced earlier this month with a 23rd June release date, but perhaps less of a surprise, given its history, when the remaster launched to less-than-stellar reviews.


For those that purchased the game via GOG, there was some respite in that all copies of the remaster came with the previously available ScummVM version, developed by a dedicated group of enthusiasts. Steam purchasers, however, were stuck with Nightdive's inferior remaster - until today, that is, when the studio revealed it would adding the ScummVM version as an alternative download for all purchases.

That's according to the persistently leaky Jeff Grubb, who shared the news on Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, saying he'd been told "pretty definitively" that an updated version of Metroid Prime 1 - what he referred to as Metroid Prime Remastered - was set to be one of Nintendo's "big holiday games" for 2022.


"In the past, this is something I'd heard was in the works," Grubb explained, "they have things happening with that game. Now I’ve been told that their plans are to release that game this holiday - I think almost certainly to line up with the 20th anniversary in November."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Fall Guys' successful, if slightly controversial, switch to free-to-play last week, developer Mediatonic has been plugging away to fix any launch week woes, and those continuing efforts have now manifested in a new patch which, among other things, should now enable PS5 players to get into games while in parties.
Beyond that headline fix, and tweaks to resolve a seperate bug preventing players from hearing party members in voice chat, Mediatonic's latest patch notes suggest an update primarily targeting smaller issues across all versions of the game, rather than anything particularly seismic, with other fixes including a range of visual issues on Switch. Here's the full list of tweaks and adjustments, for the curious, as per the Fall Guys Twitter account:
Fall Guys' transition to a free-to-pay model seems to have paid off for Mediatonic. Despite some server wobbles on launch day, the developer reported Fall Guy's new monetisation model - combined with its launch on two new platforms in Xbox and Switch - managed to push the game's player base over the 20m mark just 24 hours after its free-to-play release.

A fresh video detailing work on the project has revealed the remake's newly-stitched-together open world, and promises further additions in future - such as improvements to the game's vehicles, the addition of online multiplayer, a quest system and revamped graphics. 


The project's re-emergence now is a little surprising, since an earlier version was previously pulled offline from creator Reuben "Reubs" Ward's Patreon to avoid getting into any potential legal issues.

The studio's website states that Fntastic's "culture" is "based on the idea of volunteering" and, as such, "every Fntastic member is a volunteer" - paid or not (thanks, Well Played). 
These types of "volunteers" are divided into two categories: full-time and part-time. A full-time volunteer is apparently paid a salary, while a part-time volunteer is expected to take part in "various activities ranging from translating to community moderating". Writes Fntastic: "Part-time volunteers also can offer their unique skills to improve our projects or create new special features."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, we have a proper Nintendo Direct set in the schedule for tomorrow. Tune in at 2pm UK time for an announcement show lasting 25 minutes, focused on third-party games. 


Expect a look at Switch games made by companies other than Nintendo - so, no hoping for Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 news here. 


A previous rumour with word of tomorrow's showcase suggested we'd see the Persona franchise represented, as well as the possibility of Red Dead Redemption 2.

"I quit after three episodes of season one," Kojima wrote on Twitter, discussing the series. "I thought I'd watch the rest of the show. Actually, I watched a few episodes that were delivered at the time when I was about to start a project that I had been warming up for a long time and put it on hold because the concept was similar (different settings and tricks)."
Kojima went on to state his project would have been a "buddy (male/female) thing with a special detective squad facing off against legendary heroes behind the scenes." As well as this, Kojima had none other than Hannibal's Mads Mikkelsen in mind as his leading man.

PlayStation Plus is available on PC and allows games to be streamed, but the library differs from the console version.


The main issue is that a number of PS1, 2, and 4 games are listed incorrectly as PS3 titles, which do not load at all when selected. Correctly labelled PS3 games do play as intended.

The detail comes from a 2003 issue of Nintendo Dream magazine, which popular YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming? has now translated.


Zelda series boss Eiji Aounuma was all set to use a theremin as Link's musical instrument of choice, with each control stick on the GameCube pad set to control each of Link's hands as he manipulated its volume and pitch.

In response to an article reporting one such way of doing this, Yang replied: "Hi, please don't do this. The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved. In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for."
Yang finished by writing that, while the mod in question "may appear to work", it will "significantly shorten the life of your Deck". So, certainly something that is best avoided.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fall Guys players believe it's now quicker to level up your battle pass if you lose rather than win.

That's because of the game's all new progression and monetisation systems that were introduced when the game switched to a free-to-play model earlier this week.

As spotted by Gamerant, players can still level up their battle pass, but with new daily, weekly, and long-term challenges also now available, it seems as though maximising those will help you progress faster than winning matches... and given the time it takes to secure a winning crown, you could potentially earn the same amount of Fame more quickly just by crashing out in early rounds.

The news follows rating board confirmations in other parts of the world, too, including Brazil and Australia, and a leak of Skull & Bones' four-minute tutorial video back in April, which Ubisoft eventually confirmed was real.

The description shared on the ESRB website is the closest we've come to getting an idea of what the game - which is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox Series - entails since it underwent "extensive reworking" a couple of years back.

The post stresses that these recordings will only be evaluated when "a report for [negative] behaviour is submitted" and the system will originally kick off in Valorant before - once the "tech [is] in a good enough place" - it will be rolled out to other games.

According to GamesBeat, Stolar - whose career started in 1980 when he set up his own coin-op arcade company - died in California. He had always been a very candid and transparent executive who talked openly about his triumphs and mistakes over the years.

"I loved working for Sony," Stolar once said, according to GB. "I really did. But when the opportunity came up to go to Sega and help rebuild the business and come up with new hardware, I was very interested in doing it. I wouldn’t have left Sony if I hadn’t also lived in fear of getting fired along with everyone else, though.

Since that time, we've had Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, PSVR game, Déraciné, and Elden Ring, of course. That leaves just one mysterious game yet to be announced, which may or may not be that heavily-rumoured Armored Core instalment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has revealed its upcoming mini console, the Sega Mega Drive Mini 2, is getting a £120 (¥19,800) controller.

The USB controller is based upon the Cyber Stick and offers analogue controls for compatible games on Sega's diminutive system. As demonstrated in yesterday's announcement livestream, like its 90s predecessor, it'll feature a throttle, stick, and the ability to suit both right- and left-handed players. 

The Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 itself will retail for around half the price of this newly-announced peripheral (thanks, Famitsu).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie and a number of PlayStation studios, including Insoniac and Sucker Punch, have spoken out in support of reproductive rights following today's decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn key legislation granting individuals the constitutional right to choose an abortion - a move that gives US states the power to either severely restrict or ban the practice.


Bungie was one of the first studios to make a statement in May after the US Supreme Court's plans to overthrow Roe v Wade were leaked to the press, calling the move a "direct attack on human rights". Adding to that sentiment in a new statement shared today, it said, "Standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values."


"Last month, we stated without reservation that all of us deserve to choose our own path and access the healthcare we need," the developer continued. "The decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade cuts off millions of Americans from that access and leaves open the possibility of even further restrictions on life-saving healthcare for all of us."

And, of course, the company has not missed out on a golden opportunity to remind us all of its many IPs, from Horizon and Uncharted to Bloodborne, Ghost of Tsushima and more. 
The new trailer, which is simply called Mr. Malcom, takes us on a journey into a "mystifying and intriguing world, showcasing the lives that anyone can live, through wonderful gaming experiences". It all starts off seemingly benign, with the titular Mr Malcom enjoying a meal out before buying himself some nice juicy meat from the butcher. 
However, it soon becomes more and more surreal, as Mr. Malcom makes his way home and back to his eclectic collection. Also, that meat I just mentioned... it wasn't actually for him. You can check out the trailer for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has seen a fair amount of bad press and overall poor performance of late, a result of which has seen its chief executive taking a voluntary pay cut. 
A recent company filing revealed Yves Guillemot chose to forgo about a third of his annual compensation (via Axios), equating to a pay cut of €310k (approximately £266k / $327k). 
An Ubisoft spokesperson told Axios this was a "personal decision by Yves Guillemot, which he took considering that the company had not reached the financial targets that it had publicly communicated to the markets".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actor Chris Pratt has been discussing his - somewhat controversial - role in the upcoming CGI Super Mario Bros. movie, telling Variety that his take on the title character will be "updated and unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world before."


Mario has, of course, been voiced by Charles Martinet since 1992, and his video game performance has become inseparable from Nintendo's flagship character. As such, Mario fans were somewhat aghast last year when Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto announced Pratt would be replacing Martinet as the voice of Mario in the upcoming film.


It's a casting decision that few seemed to have warmed to even ten months on, despite the best efforts of Chris Meledandri, producer of the Super Mario film, who insisted Pratt's performance as Mario was "phenomenal" last November. Meledandri then defended his star again this week, saying criticism of Pratt's casting would "evaporate" when people heard his performance.

It'll also include a new, more challenging difficulty mode, plus support for seven new languages.


Alongside the update for existing platforms, Into the Breach will also be making its iOS and Android debut on 19th July.

Evil Empire first discussed improving Dead Cells' accessibility back in January, when it began canvassing players for feedback on how it could expand the game to better suit a wide range of needs. It then shared an update on its progress in May, detailing some of the accessibility options that were on the way.


After a round of beta testing, all that work has now been moved to the live game with the official launch of Breaking Barriers. The update brings an huge range of new accessibility features - tested by a panel of players with various disabilities at AbleGamers - all of which have been detailed in a lengthy new blog post and nine-minute video breakdown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - also available in audio form! - we look in detail at today's final rollout of PlayStation Plus Premium, which is now available in the UK and mainland Europe.

We now know all of the games included in the PlayStation Plus Premium catalogue at launch and it's enough to hit Sony's promises, certainly, though there are still odd omissions. The lack of 60Hz for some PS1 games (for now) also points to a rather rushed release, despite the extra weeks we've waited on these shores.

So, what can Sony do to build on this launch and improve the new PlayStation Plus Premium further? And, after all that, have we ended up subscribing ourselves? Eurogamer's Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If an entire universe in the palm of your hand sounds neat, you're probably already excited about the launch of exploratory space sim No Man's Sky on Switch. And it turns out the wait for its arrival won't go on too much longer, with developer Hello Games having now confirmed it'll be coming to Nintendo's console - initially as a single-player-only experience - on 7th October.


No Man's Sky, of course, launched for PC and PS4 back in the summer of 2016, giving players an entire procedural universe to explore as their whims took them. That initial version memorably came in for some criticism, but Hello Games has continued to expand on the game's solid survival core since then, delivering over 19, often significant, free updates.


These have introduced the likes of base building, bobbleheads, farming, giant customisable space freighters, land and water vehicles, pilotable mechs, living ships, alien-infested space derelicts, new flora and fauna, pets, live-service-style community expeditions, music tools, sand worms, and more - all of which should be included at launch on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new boardgame set in Cyberpunk 2077's dystopian world of Night City recently launched on Kickstarter, and has quickly  surpassed its target.
The game, which is known as Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City - The Board Game, comes from a collaboration with CMON, whose other works include Zombicide, Blood Rage, The Others, Rising Sun, Massive Darkness and Arcadia Quest, to name but a few. 
It sees up to four players taking on the role of the ruthless gangs vying for control in the "glittering hellhole" of Night City (much as the name suggests).

Fans had been eyeing the service's slow roll-out over the course of the past month through different countries around the world - until its final deployment in the UK and mainland Europe today. 


Ahead of time, Sony had promised "up to 400" PlayStation 4 and PS5 games would be available to both PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tier subscribers - though the initial launch in Asia fell well short. Eurogamer's list of PS4 and PS5 games available today comes to 429.

Of course, it takes a top-down viewpoint akin to classic RPGs (the video notes Secret of Mana, Terranigma, and Final Fantasy 6 as inspiration), with a cute little Tarnished defeating various iconic bosses with melee weapons and magic.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In recent decades, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which develops cryptographic standards for non-national security agencies of the U.S. government, has emerged as the de facto international source for cryptographic standards. But in 2013, Edward Snowden disclosed that the National Security Agency had subverted the integrity of a NIST cryptographic standard­the Dual_EC_DRBG­enabling easy decryption of supposedly secured communications. This discovery reinforced the desire of some public and private entities to develop their own cryptographic standards instead of relying on a U.S. government process. Yet, a decade later, no credible alternative to NIST has emerged. NIST remains the only viable candidate for effectively developing internationally trusted cryptography standards...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The film is currently the eighth-biggest film launch worldwide this year, but, as Deadline reports, this place is likely to jump up a few notches with the film still to release in both Hong Kong and Japan. 
These numbers are a pretty impressive sight, but perhaps not unexpected. After all, Sonic 2 reportedly enjoyed the greatest opening weekend for any video-game based movie ever on its release in April.

The handheld shoot 'em-up, originally launched in 2008, can be found by searching directly for the title in the PlayStation Store (thanks to reddit user Turb0_Thunder).


You won't find it (yet) via the Classic Catalogue menu, although it's unclear if this is because it's not due to go live yet, or a deliberate secret. (Either way, PlayStation's store interface isn't the clearest to filter and search through.)

When developer Crystal Dynamics first confirmed Foster was to be Marvel's Avengers' next playable hero, the studio said the character would have "a lot in common" with the version of Thor already in-game, albeit with "elements that are distinctly Jane".


Crystal Dynamics has since expanded on that, revealing Foster will arrive with a few new baseline abilities setting her apart from Odinson, including a new ranged combo and new ranged power attack. There's also her new Intrinsic ability (All-Mother's Blessing), a new Overcharge ability (God Tempest), and a new Ultimate ability (All-Weapon) enabling her to smite foes using both the Undrjarn and Mjölnir.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite running into some considerable set-backs shortly after its initial announcement, leading to an indefinite delay, developer Nightdive Studios' highly anticipated remaster of Westwood Studio's classic Blade Runner point-and-click adventure is finally complete, and will be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, tomorrow, 23rd June.


The Blade Runner game, for those unfamiliar, released in 1997, and, unlike the vast majority of licensed adaptations, was an extraordinary piece of work, not only managing to perfectly capture the neon-streaked dystopian atmosphere of the movie in a story that ran parallel to its action, but doing so in ways both wildly ambitious and legitimately groundbreaking.


Although Blade Runner takes its cue from narrative-driven point-and-click games, it immediately distinguishes itself from its genre peers by sending players, in the role of Blade Runner Ray McCoy, on a heavily randomised adventure. The goal remains the same each play-through, in that players must use their investigatory skills to identify and hunt down a number of replicants, but exactly which characters are replicants is determined at the start of a new game, subtly changing their behaviour as the story unfolds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Creative Assembly has finally unmasked Hyenas, its long-in-the-works sci-fi shooter - and while Alien Isolation fans might be a little disappointed to see it's not a much-hoped for successor, anyone who's ever dreamed of doing heists in a space should be very cheerful.


Creative Assembly first revealed it was working on a sci-fi shooter back in September 2018, calling it an "ambitious multiplayer title" and a "fresh take on the FPS genre" that would enable players to "embrace a variety of creative playstyles". Almost four years later, that project has now been named as Hyenas, a "ballsy entry into the most competitive genre in gaming".


"In Hyenas, the world is broken... literally," explains Creative Assembly. "The billionaires have finally made it to Mars, leaving Earth and those tax bills far behind. The zero-gravity tech that powered their journey has shattered our planet, abandoning us in a drifting slum called the 'Taint'. The only thing the rich care for is rare Merch, pop culture swag from the lives we left behind, which they loot from the rubble to furnish their Martian mansions."

"That's a unique experience that we're setting up just for these extra bonuses in Community Day," Pokémon Go game director Michael Steranka told me today, referring to the bonuses players will get to extend their local Community Day experience by taking part in the game's new in-person-only event raids.

YouTuber MythyMoo used an item and boss randomiser mod that mixes up the placement of acquired items and bosses, which can massively impact the difficulty of a run. The mod also mixes up the names of each boss.


Except, as PCGamesN reports, things took a turn when MythyMoo arrived in the Consecrated Snowfield, an area with various field bosses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Epic Games Store has launched its own version of user reviews and tags, via randomised game ratings and polls it hopes will avoid the kinds of review bombing seen frequently on Steam. 


The ability to rate a game on a five-star scale will be randomly offered to owners of that title who have played it for more than two hours. 


"Because these requests are randomised, we won't spam our players, and we probably won't ask about every game or app used," Epic Games' Craig Pearson explained. "This approach protects games from review bombing and ensures people assigning scores are actual players of the games."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo presented a deep dive into the imminent JRPG epic Xenoblade Chronicles in today's focussed Direct presentation, revealing an expansion pass that unlocks helpful items and outfits upon the game's release next month and that will provide access to a new story scenario that's set to launch before the end of 2023. 


There was plenty more shown off, with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 thankfully dialling back some of the anime excesses of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - there was not a single improbably proportioned sidekick to be seen - while restoring some of the scale and wonder of Xenoblade Chronicles X. 


Set on the planet of Aionios, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is set against a backdrop of warring factions from the nations of Keves and Agnos, and a world in which people have pre-determined lifespans of 10 years. Your party is drawn from three characters from each side who've put their differences aside - and opening up a broader, deeper take on combat that's rich with systems.

Players at Pokémon Go's three big in-person gatherings in Berlin, Seattle and Sapporo this summer will be first to use Beast Balls over the next six weeks, and get first access to one of the next three Ultra Beasts to arrive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new update for Gran Turismo 7 lands early tomorrow, bringing three new cars previously teased as well as the surprise introduction of a track that's entirely new to Polyphony Digital's series. 


Watkins Glen International is a staple of the US racing scene, playing host to F1 until it was deemed unsafe after a series of fatal accidents. It's a ramshackle kind of place that now plays host to the likes of IMSA and NASCAR, and it's an absolute delight to drive either of the configurations that are on offer in Gran Turismo 7's take on the track. 


There's a trio of new cars too, with a brace of Suzukis including a new fictional 'Vision' car alongside the iconic V6 Escudo Pikes Peak Special (now how about putting Pikes Peak in the game, seeing as Gran Turismo's been squatting on the official licence for the legendary course for a while?).

Fans have speculated whether other characters will join battles, which producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed to IGN - although they will remain AI-controlled.


"We didn't want to overwhelm users in our newest trailer, so we focused solely on Clive's battles. That said, for most of his journey, Clive will be accompanied by one or more companions. These companions will participate in battle, as well as trade banter with Clive. That said, the party members will be AI-driven so as to allow players to focus solely on controlling Clive," said Yoshida.

In a PlayStation Blog interview, the Final Fantasy 16 producer describes how he was honoured to be offered the opportunity to work on a single-player game in the series, but thought fans may criticise him.



"I said 'Thanks, but I have my hands full with Final Fantasy 14, so let me think about it.' I was truly honoured that the company would choose my section, Creative Business Unit 3, to be responsible for making the next entry in the FF series. But, as you probably know, I'm already the producer and director of Final Fantasy 14. I was worried that if I took on the directorship of 16, too, fans of both games would have good reason to believe I wasn't giving either project my full attention," said Yoshida.

Speaking to Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, DICE's recently-appointed general manager Rebecka Coutaz confirmed any project such as Mirror's Edge was currently sat on the backburner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5 got a hefty new patch which adds two of the most requested features for Xbox and PC players alike. 


Players can now finally start Horizon Stories with friends in co-op, a feature that was strangely omitted from the game at launch and even stranger given the social nature of the game. 


Previously, players in a convoy would be booted off when the host starts a story mission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is the latest big company to announce it will skip Gamescom this year. 


The annual European show, held in Cologne, was traditionally the world's largest in terms of visitors. This summer will see Gamescom return as a physical event for the first time since 2019, albeit with fewer publishers in attendance. 

PlayStation confirmed its decision to skip Gamescom 2022 in a statement to German publication Games Wirtschaft (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), where it also confirmed it would not feature any announcements in the show's Geoff Keighley-fronted livestream Opening Night Live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 will not have an open world.


Producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed the news in an interview with IGN, although he said that recent open world games have provided "inspiration".


"We've found in our extensive user research that many of the younger generation of gamers have never played a Final Fantasy or don't have any interest in the series. To create a game that might excite and resonate not only with our core fans, but also with that new generation, we played a lot of games ourselves, and so yes, in [Final Fantasy 16] you'll find inspiration from recent triple-A open world RPGs," said Yoshida.

Developer Mediatonic first acknowledged the issues yesterday afternoon, in a fashionably Fall Guys-style tweet.


Late last night, things seemed to be improving, with more players able to get into game. But still there were  "teething issues", as servers were flooded with new players across PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has issued a new update for Team Fortress 2, a month after acknowledging a high-profile fan campaign that highlighted the current state of the game. 


A "peaceful protest" to "#SaveTF2" was organised by fans in May to raise awareness of the game's many bugs, its ongoing bot problems, and the general lack of updates by Valve despite TF2's ongoing popularity.


In response, Valve said it had heard the game's community. "We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things," it wrote shortly after.

Producer Naoki Yoshida has spoken in multiple interviews about the game, divulging new information about its conception.


"When it came to deciding what to do with Final Fantasy 16, I thought back to when I played the original Final Fantasy, and remembered how I felt like I was playing the leading role in a motion picture," he said in a new PlayStation Blog post.

Dragonflight, as detailed in Blizzard's April reveal stream, will give players access to the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind, known as the Dragon Isles, introducing four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, Ohn’ahran Plains, Azure Span, and Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also adds the Dracthyr Evokers - a new playable race-class hybrid that can, depending on a players' chosen class specialisations, focus on either damage dealing or healing - plus a new skill-based flight system tied to customisable dragon companions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard shareholders have voted to approve a proposal that the company should publish an annual report detailing the effectiveness and outcomes of its efforts to prevent abuse, harassment, and discrimination in its workplace - a non-binding vote Activision has, as yet, only said it will "carefully consider".


The proposal, originally raised by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli in February, requested that Activision publically release an annual report detailing several key metrics: the total number of pending sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or ligation; details of the company's progress toward reducing the average time it takes to resolve sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints; the amount of money it has spent settling disputes related to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, and finally pay and hours worked consolidated data.


While this kind of transparency might seem prudent given the shocking allegations that have surfaced in relation to Activision Blizzard's workplace practices over the last year, and given that the publisher remains embroiled in a number of lawsuits relating to those practices - including last July's State of California filing, which called the company a "breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women" - the company's board of directors instead wrote to shareholders in May unanimously urging them to vote against the proposal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After more than five years of development, Redbeet Interactive's enormously enjoyable open water survival adventure Raft has just received its full version 1.0 release, bringing, among other things, the final chunk of its exploratory story campaign.


Raft, if you're unfamiliar, first started to attract attention as a free prototype on itch.io back in 2016. Redbeet steadily expanded on that version's core survival loop - in which players start out on a tiny wooden raft in the middle of the ocean, hooking up foods, supplies, and building materials until their tiny vessel is a veritable sea-faring palace - in preparation for a commercial early access release on Steam, which finally arrived in 2018.


Since then, Redbeet has continued to build on that early feature set, introducing the likes of online co-op, explorable islands, underwater reefs, crop growing, cooking, animal care, and even a full story campaign in which players can learn more about the flooded world.

On the animal front, Planet Zoo's Conservation Pack brings five new additions - Przewalski's horse, amur leopard, scimitar-horned oryx, siamang, and axolotl - all of which are considered at-risk species as a result of climate change, poaching, and habitat degradation.


Elsewhere, the DLC introduces a new scenario challenging players to assist the Turtlerock Wildlife Orphanage, inspired by Mongolia's Gorkhi Terelj National Park, by rescuing, raising, documenting and releasing as many species as possible. Renewable energy, plant diversity, and sustainability will be an important focus too.

Released on Epic, PlayStation, and Xbox in March, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands takes the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2's much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep and spins it out into a full-sized game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


The game-within-a-game premise casts players as an unnamed "newbie" in the real, Borderlands world who's taking part in a D&D-like game called Bunkers and Badasses. Several celebrity-voiced friends are along for the ride, as is the irrepressible Tina, as Dungeon Master.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rights to Steam hit Spintires - as well as the fate of millions of dollars in revenue for spin-off sequels Mudrunner and Snowrunner - are the focus of several major legal claims between Saber Interactive and the game's original publisher Oovee, Eurogamer can reveal. 


The increasingly bitter fight between the two companies escalated significantly last week with the issuing of a press release by a legal firm associated with Oovee containing numerous claims directed at Saber, and the brief return of Spintires to Steam despite its previous delisting in the wake of another legal challenge. 


Saber has subsequently filed a defamation claim in relation to Oovee's allegations, Eurogamer can also reveal, while Spintires' Steam page is now back offline pending various DMCA challenges.

A tweet from the Nintendo Japan account states that the iOS version of the app will be updated in "summer 2022" and will only be compatible with iOS version 14.0 or later.


It therefore won't be available on iOS version 13.0 or earlier, according to a rough translation of the tweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA's Battlefield 2042 has attracted its fair share of controversy since it launched last November, with players unhappy with the omission of key features at launch as well as some questionable design decisions which resulted in fan backlash. 


There have been updates since release that have corrected the course of Battlefield 2042, with the belated launch of its first season earlier this month introducing a new map and features that have gone down well with the game's community. 


Despite these updates, however, Battlefield 2042 still has players fighting under a Russian flag as one of the two factions in the game - a decision that sits uncomfortably given the invasion of Ukraine from Russian forces, and in light of EA's decision to remove Russian clubs and the Russian national football team from FIFA 22, FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online.

The move coincides with the launch of Sony's new subscription service this week, which has multiple price tiers - making the old retail cards somewhat obsolete.

However, for those that are keen for more thrills (and bloody spills) in its horror-filled world, fear not, as fans have your backs. 
A remake of the original Silent Hill is currently being made in Unreal Engine 5 by a group called Codeless Games (via DSO Gaming). And not only is it in development, but we have also been given a peak at 10 minutes of gameplay that focuses on Midwich Elementary School (a major building that protagonist Harry Mason explores in a bid to find his missing daughter). 
This project does a pretty good job at setting the scene and overall atmosphere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 may be a lot of things to a lot of different people, but one thing most would probably agree on is that it's a bloody big console. Now, however, one enterprising YouTuber has taken up the challenge of downsizing the machine to create the "world's first PS5 Slim console" - one that's less than 2cm thick.


The project is the work of YouTube channel DIY Perks, which specialises in videos about designing and building gadgets and technology at home, and begins with a tear-down of Sony's behemoth console to figure exactly which of its innards should stay and wish can go to hit that 2cm target.


Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of the PS5's bulk comes from its steel shrouding and CPU-cooling heatsink, and with those gone, DIY Perk's target seems a little closer to reality. Ultimately, to hit that magic number, PS5's existing cooling solution is replaced with a custom water-channeling system made from copper sheeting. It's not a cheap option, costing an eyewatering $240 for the sheeting alone, but it appears to do the job.

Outriders launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation last April, delivering a slice of co-operative shooter action that Eurogamer reviewer Vikki Blake enjoyed, albeit with some caveats. "For some," she wrote, "I suspect Outriders doesn't innovate enough to stand out from an already oversaturated shooter market, relying too much on the ideas of other, stronger titles that have come before it."


"[But] as a die-hard Guardian and card-carrying fangirl of the genre," Vikki continued, "Outriders tickles me in all the right places. Offering gunplay that feels solid and satisfying and an array of additional powers and abilities to keep combat fresh and exciting, I can only admit that Outriders has surprised me in all the right ways. Maybe it'll surprise you, too."

Shiro eventually confirmed multiplayer would arrive this "summer" as part of its inaugural development roadmap, and that day is finally here.


According to today's patch notes, Dune's multiplayer can utilise both dedicated servers and peer-to-peer connections, and enables players to try their hand at 2v2 matches or test their mettle in four-person free-for-alls, playing as Atreides, Harkonnen, Fremen, or Smugglers.

Roller Champions is Ubisoft's stab at creating its own chaotic sports mash-up in the vein of Rocket League, albeit one that switches out the latter's cars-meet-football concept for a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football.


The gist is that two teams of three players hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another. When one team finally has the ball, they need to complete at least one lap before pelting it into the goal, with additional points accrued the more laps they can keep hold of it before taking a successful shot.

How does it work? He wears two gloves that have motion sensors and a stick in each hand for movement. Simply punching the air is enough for light attacks, with other motions used for heavy attacks and parries, and then picking up items and other interactions are done by clicking in the sticks.

According to the analysts at Appmagic (thanks, Pocket Gamer), that makes Diablo Immortal - which has been downloaded over eight million times in just a fortnight - one of Blizzard's biggest mobile app, second only to the immense popularity of Hearthstone. 

The game has seen its biggest success in the US, which accounts for 26 per cent of all downloads. This is followed by South Korea, Brazil, and Japan, with 11 per cent, 8 per cent, and 8 per cent of the market share respectively. The UK only features in the 17 per cent "other" category which aggregates low-level figures across the rest of the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, developer Supermassive released its sumputous slasher horror The Quarry on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in collaboration with publisher 2K Games - but a new report has claimed the game was originally in development as a "signature" title for Stadia, before Google made the decision to downsize its gaming operation and send the project elsewhere.


Stadia, of course, launched to much fanfare in 2019, and part of Google's promise to early adopters was that the service would bring its own console-like exclusives from both first- and third-parties. To that end, Google established its own internal game development studio and signed deals with external developers, including Supermassive, as announced in 2020.


Those plans, however, changed dramatically just 14 months after Stadia's high-profile arrival, with Google announcing a major rethink of its cloud streaming strategy following a less-than-stellar launch, which included the cancellation of all internal game development as it began prioritising selling its tech to third-parties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its ongoing war against cheaters, the team behind Call of Duty's server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, known as Ricochet, has unveiled a new mitigation technique that takes a player's weapons (and fists) away when the system identifies them as a cheater.


Word of this latest mitigation technique comes via a new blog update detailing the current state of Call of Duty's anti-cheat solution, and follows previously revealed anti-cheat techniques Cloaking and Damage Shield.


Damage Shield, Richochet's first major mitigation technique, essentially works by turning on God Mode for all legitimate players when a cheater is detected in-match. Cloaking, meanwhile, makes it impossible for detected cheaters to see opponents and bullets, or even hear sounds.

The roughly $20m pay cut was signalled last summer, when EA acknowledged "stockholder feedback" from a non-binding but decisive say-on-pay vote. 


In a nutshell, stockholders said EA's execs were being handed pay awards from the company money pot that were too large and too frequent. In response, EA said it would make "substantial changes" to the pay of executives.

This crossover is thanks to the hard work of Speclizer, who used mods from OmegaFantasy to swap out Kratos and Atreus for Joel and Ellie respectively (it was also OmegaFantasy that enabled The Simpsons to tootle on over to God of War last month). This was done to "celebrate two amazing games coming out this year".
And its not just Joel and Ellie that we get to see in action. The Last of Us' David also shows up as the mysterious 'stranger' from the start of God of War, while the draugr have now become clickers.

This is the game where you capture pictures of Pokémon, rather than capture the creatures themselves and force them to do your bidding. 


There have been plenty of weird and wonderful Pokémon spin-offs over the years, but Snap holds a firm place as one of the best. Via an on-rails safari through Pokémon environments, you get to see the little critters mucking about in their natural habitats.
