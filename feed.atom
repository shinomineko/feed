Deviation Games was set up in November 2019 by former Treyarch Studios developers Dave Anthony and Jason Blundell, both of whom played a key role in the success of the Call of Duty: Black Ops series.
Blundell, one of the chief creators of Call of Duty's popular zombies mode, left Treyarch after 13 years at the developer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somerville has been teased with a number of trailers over the past few years, but during yesterday's Xbox-Bethesda showcase we got another look at the game - and now have some idea of what the main characters will look like.  
The sci-fi adventure is being made by Jumpship, an independent studio founded by animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Playdead co-founder and former CEO Dino Patti. (Playdead created Limbo and its spiritual successor Inside, two very unsettling puzzle-platformers.) 
As you can see from the trailer, Somerville set in a sci-fi world and focuses on the struggles of a family trying to survive a major disaster. "In the wake of catastrophe you must find the means to make your family whole again," says the official description. "Somerville is a sci-fi adventure grounded in the intimate repercussions of large-scale conflict.

This dinky puzzle platformer has you controlling a miniature alien astronaut as he explores our world. He's aided in his travels by a swarm of mini creatures, named tinykin. 
Sound familiar? While clearly inspired by Nintendo's Pikmin, what impressed me here was how snappy and fluid the movement and exploration looks, with tinykin used to create ladders or skate around.

Curious Final Fantasy fans first reported an inability to load the demo after downloading it last night. This morning, our Aoife told me it's still not working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in May, rumours began circulating that Square Enix was collaborating with Nioh developer Team Ninja on an action-focussed Final Fantasy spin-off titled Final Fantasy Origin. Well, it turns out those rumours weren't far off at all! Square has now officially unveiled Team Ninja's action-RPG Final Fantasy spin-off, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins.
Stranger of Paradise follows a band of adventurers who, as the trailer repeatedly reminds us, want to kill chaos. Or at least stab it in the face a few times until its head pops off. "Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine," Square elaborates in its announcement, "Yet doubts remain-are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?".
May's rumours suggested the game would slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja's Nioh games and From Software's Souls series, albeit with a more accessible focus, and today's reveal appears to support that. Square is promising "exhilarating, action-packed battles" against iconic Final Fantasy monsters in a "world of dark fantasy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platinum Games' long-awaited Square Enix title Babylon's Fall is now coming to PS5 as well as PS4 and PC. This was announced during Square Enix's E3 showcase this evening.
The game's also going live-service. The publisher treated audiences to a fairly brief trailer, featuring in-game footage of a frantic 3D action game with lots of armour and magical lightning and some decent operatic music. A follow-up developer interview revealed a game in which teams of players enjoy hack-and-slash combat and explore dungeons in groups of four. These dungeons are located on different floors of a giant tower, and end with a boss.
Regular updates will allow for new moves that can be equipped as skills. There's a focus on character customisation and crafting, and a massive emphasis on builds, due to a "Gideon coffin" the characters wear that allows them to equip two additional weapons alongside the weapons they hold in their hands, and, I think, swing them about independently, a la Astral Chain. The game will ship with five weapon types, and there will be a website that allows players to tweak their builds while they're away from the game.

While we don't yet know exactly what the gameplay will look like, it will feature co-op with up to four players. "Redfall blends single and multiplayer options seamlessly, allowing the player to venture into the darkness alone or to squad-up with up to three friends for four-player co-op", a Bethesda press release explained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Asobo's jaw-droppingly beautiful Microsoft Flight Simulator finally has a console release date, and will be coming to Xbox Series X/S on 27th July.
Microsoft Flight Simulator received much praise when it launched on PC at the end of last year, in large part thanks to its utterly staggering rendition of the entire world - one that Asobo has continued to build on with regular free sim updates and visual overhauls for the likes of Japan, the United States, France, Benelux, the UK, and Ireland.
"From light planes to wide-body jets," explains Microsoft of its flight sim, "you'll test your piloting skills against the challenges of real-time weather, including accurate worldwide cloud cover and cloud layers, wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, rain, and lightning - all in a dynamic and living world. With the power of satellite data and cloud-based AI, you'll travel the entire planet in amazing detail with over 37,000 airports, 2 million cities, 1.5 billion buildings, real mountain ranges, roads, trees, rivers, animals, traffic, and more."

There was also plenty of siege and town-based action, and lots of people in armour running at each other on nice grassy hills, which is exactly what we want.

The third-person platformer has seen a series of delays, with developer Double Fine previously explaining that it needed more time to bring it up to standard, and that the studio needed time to adjust to its acquisition by Microsoft. It looks like we'll finally see the results of all this hard work soon, however, and Double Fine provided a fresh peek at Psychonauts 2 with a gameplay trailer shown during the showcase livestream:  
"Psychonauts 2 is an exciting journey through the mind filled with the signature Double Fine humor and heart, and a touch of next-level platforming," says the official blog post. "You play as Razputin Aquato, a trained acrobat and powerful young psychic, who has realized his lifelong dream of joining the international psychic espionage organization known as the Psychonauts. But these psychic super spies are in trouble. Raz must use his powers to bring the murderous psychic villain, Maligula, back from the dead! Check out the video above and get psyched!"

It's all in-game captured footage from an Xbox Series X, showing off the chaos of the game's new 128-person battles and a range of new toys.
The highlights include a tank being air-dropped into battle via parachute, a grappling hook that should open up some new opportunities for the more ingenuitive campers (and anti-campers), some cross-skyscraper ziplines, a desert cyclone, and a rocket launching into the atmosphere. There's a nice tone to it all, too - clearly DICE is aware of the more ridiculous stunts the Battlefield community has become known for pulling off.

Davy Jones, inevitably, isn't far behind, and the adventure will see players setting sail to visit new locations from both universes - including some from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park rides that didn't quite make it into the movies.

Confirmation came during a reveal of Far Cry 6's season pass details, which also showed that the DLC lets you play as Vaas, Pagan Min, and Joseph Seed - villains from previous Far Cry games. 
While, admittedly, the teaser doesn't tell us much, the neon colours that come in 30 seconds before the end of the trailer are unmistakable. Here, take a look:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five Nights at Freddy's creator Scott Cawthon has said he "won't apologise for" funding US Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, but acknowledged that "with so many people from the LGBT community in the fanbase that I love", it was "not an option" to ignore fan backlash about his political beliefs.
While many of the candidates Cawthon backed are conservative and sit within America's right-leaning Republican party, Cawthon insists that "for those who took the time to look", they'd see that the candidates he supported "included men, women, white people, black people, republicans, and democrats". 
Directly addressing his community on Reddit, Cawthon also took the time to discuss why he supports Republicans despite their broadly anti-LGBTQIA+ stance, stating "even if there were candidates who had better things to say to the LGBT community directly, and bigger promises to make, I believed that their stances on other issues would have ended up doing much greater harm to those communities than good".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Town of Light developer LKA has dropped a new video teaser for its upcoming psychological thriller, Martha Is Dead.
The trailer doesn't give away much, but it does touch upon the Tale of the White Lady, "the spirit of a murdered, tortured soul whose one goal is to seek a moment's relief by dragging others into the water to suffer the same fate".
The "savage story" told in the video is reportedly based upon a real-life Italian legend, which is purportedly passed down through from generation to generation much as it's done in this trailer, with the young Giulia badgering her grandmother to tell her the spooky story of "a drowned maiden, murdered in a fit of jealousy by her lover who now stalks the shores of the lake where she suffered in her final moments".

It is perhaps surprising to see the visually-impressive role-player getting ported to last-gen - not that we saw much of what that PS4 version might look like today. But this move will, obviously, open up the game to a wider audience.
Today also brought word of Fire & Darkness, a new expansion for Godfall which adds in a new realm, new story, and a hoard of new loot.

Let's start with Trek to Yomi, a "cinematic tour-de-force" inspired by classic samurai films from director Leonard Menchiari and Flying Wild Hog, the Polish studio behind the 2013 reboot of Shadow Warrior and its 2016 sequel, Shadow Warrior 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to 2017, and you might recall Ubisoft announcing it was working on a new video game adaptation of James Cameron's Avatar movie. Five years of almost complete silence around the project followed, but all that's now changed, with Ubisoft showing the first footage of its Avatar game, now titled Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, during its E3 livestream.
"In this new, standalone story," explains Ubisoft, "play as a Na'vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by unique creatures and new characters, and push back the formidable RDA forces that threaten it."
Ubisoft is calling Frontiers of Pandora a first-person action-adventure and a "immersive, open world experience", and its trailer - running on the latest version of Ubisoft's Snowdrop Engine, according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot - offers a jaunt through a gorgeous rendition of the planet Pandora, complete with all the exotic flora and fauna you could possible hope for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humankind, Amplitude's upcoming, history-spanning 4X game, gets a new closed beta soon, and it'll let you play through five of the game's six eras. There's also a snazzy new trailer to come with the announcement, which you can watch here:
Amplitude's done plenty of other betas like this in the past - which the studio refers to as OpenDevs - but this is the furthest into a game of Humankind you'll have been able to get, by some way.
You can play either 200 turns or up to the end of the Industrial Era, whichever comes first. Industrial era features include resources like coal and oil, railways, and artillery and air battles - we actually had a chance to explore some more of this ourselves during our latest preview but barely got halfway there, despite playing a good 10 to 15-odd hours, which should give you an idea of just how long you get with this beta.

This is the first time any game in the Assassin's Creed series has received this level of post-launch support, but this news isn't surprising. Firstly, Valhalla has gone down very well. Secondly, as we reported last month, datamining has pointed to the mythical realm of Muspelheim coming down the line. And, indeed, Ubisoft teased Muspelheim tonight.
Before all that, Valhalla has its previously-announced Siege of Paris expansion coming this summer. No release date for that was shared, but we got a good look at footage. Ubisoft also confirmed the fan-favourite "black box" missions from the series' past will return here. These are assassination target opportunities where you have a set location and multiple methods to take down a target.

A video advert was spotted by fans playing on YouTube, and although Ubisoft has issued copyright claims in a bid to scrub the leak from the internet, it's readily available.
According to the advert, the Far Cry 6 season pass lets you play as villains from previous Far Cry games. Vaas from Far Cry 3 is shown, as is Pagan from Far Cry 4 and Joseph from Far Cry 5.

Speaking in the latest Axios Gaming newsletter, Ryan was asked about a 2017 interview with Time in which he recalled seeing different versions of Gran Turismo running side-by-side on PSone, PS2, PS3 and PS4.
"The PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?" he said at the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been almost a year and a half since our coins were well and truly tossed by Netflix's inaugural season of The Witcher, so anticipation is understandably high for news on Season Two. As part of its Geeked Week of reveals, Netflix teased a first look at things to come, and it's delivered exactly that - albeit limiting itself to just 12 seconds of footage.
Even before the conclusion of The Witcher's well-received first season, Netflix confirmed an eventual return for Geralt, Jennefer, Ciri, and Jaskier (as played by Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, Freya Allan, and Joey Batey respectively).
Since then, we've learned that the second season - which promises to dial back on the time-hopping antics of its predecessor - will usher in new cast members including Simon Callow as the Dorian detective Codringher, Silent Witness' Liz Carr as business partner Fenn, Bridgerton's Adjoa Andoh as priestess Nenneke, and Brave New World's Cassie Clare as Phillippa Eilhart, sorceress and advisor to King Vizimir.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's animated adaptation of legendary video game series Castlevania is now at the end of its acclaimed four-season run, and fans have been wondering what comes next. Today brings answer: more Castlevania, but different.
Castlevania's future on Netflix was left in doubt when the streaming service opted to wind up the series in its current guise after showrunner Warren Ellis departed from the show following allegations of sexual misconduct. However, subsequent rumours suggested a spin-off was in the works, and Netflix has now made that official.
With Castlevania's current run now concluded, Netflix is working on a brand-new series that will take Richter Belmont (son of original series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - both familiar characters to game fans - to 1792 France for an adventure that unfolds against the backdrop of the French Revolution.

A Splinter Cell animated adaptation was first rumoured last July, but Ubisoft and Netflix have now made the show official. It'll follows the adventures of iconic video game series protagonist Sam Fisher after he's recruited to work for the NSA's mysterious Echelon Division.
Expect black ops missions, stealth, and military tactics in a series that's being written by John Wick scribe Derek Kolstad. That's pretty much all Netflix has shared right now, other than this appropriately shadowy glimpse of Sam as he'll appear in the show:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has a lot of video game adaptations in the works at the moment, and we'll be seeing the fruits of those ongoing labours later today as its Geeked Week of reveals concludes. It promises to be a busy one - debuting footage from the likes of The Witcher Season 2 and Cuphead - but first there are the opening three minutes of the streaming service's CGI Resident Evil series ahead of its release in July. 
Known as Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, this animated adaption takes place several years after the events of Resident Evil 4, with Leon S. Kennedy once again serving as the US president's bodyguard - which would probably seem like a walk in the park compared to his usual adventures if it wasn't for the threat of an imminent zombie outbreak.
Claire Redfield also plays a role in Leon's latest adventure, embarking on her own investigation as (the supposedly canon) events unfold, and if you're curious to see how proceedings kick off, you can do that via the first three minutes of the show below.

There's Donna, a "spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life"; John, an "overworked middle-aged single dad" who's "burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent"; plus Meera, a "ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work."

Earlier this year CD Projekt announced it had been hit by a ransomware attack, and last week we began to hear reports this stolen data was being actively shared online. Several developer-made bug montages emerged from this, but source code for several CD Projekt games (including The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077) is also reported to have been shared, and CD Projekt is concerned employee and contractor data is caught up in this.
"... We have learned new information regarding the breach, and now have reason to believe that internal data illegally obtained during the attack is currently being circulated on the internet," the statement says. "We are not able to confirm the exact contents of the data in question, though we believe it may include current/former employee and contractor details in addition to data related to our games. Furthermore, we cannot confirm whether or not the data involved may have been manipulated or tampered with following the breach."

Only a handful of the titles have been revealed so far. Thankfully, one of them is Sable, the gorgeous-looking desert sci-fi game which we'll have a write-up on very soon. Another is Tunic, the adorably cute, Zelda-like adventure game. Both of these were glimpsed in the Summer Games Fest broadcast this evening.
The other games on the list are The Riftbreaker, which I've tried on PC (and really liked), and Echo Generation and Lake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sky: Children of the Light, the acclaimed "social adventure" from Journey and Flower developer ThatGameCompany, will be making its way to Switch on 29th June.
Sky, which debuted on iOS in 2019 before heading to Android, unfolds across the seven realms of a beautiful kingdom of billowing clouds, which players can explore as their whims take them.
There are puzzley-platformy elements alongside delicate story vignettes, and it's all build around a gently collaborative multiplayer aspect, where co-operation is integral to progression, designed to encourage "compassion, friendship, and altruism".

It's the work of new outfit Wishfully, and has a Limbo-esque vibe to it. While more colourful, there's definitely something eerie about watching Planet of Lana's protagonist and her little friend see rockets falling from the sky.
"Planet of Lana is a cinematic puzzle adventure framed by an epic sci-fi saga that stretches across centuries and galaxies," Wishfully describes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Bombay, the studio formed by Left 4 Dead and Portal writer Chet Faliszek, and Riot Games designer Kimberley Voll, has revealed its new game The Anacrusis.
It's - like Left 4 Dead - a co-operative shooter for four people, and it takes place on an abandoned starship on the edge of explored space. There you'll fight seemingly endless hordes of aliens in an "infinitely replayable fight", according to Summer Games Fest host Geoff Keighley, who announced the game. You'll unlock perks and weapons and "new ways to play you can share with your team", said Keighley.
Despite the theme, Anacrusis looks like a very bright and upbeat game. It's not dissimilar to the Portal series, actually, with brightly lit, clean sci-fi scenery, and some arty splashes of turquoise and orangey-red here and there. Very pleasant.

The big news revealed during Summer Game Fest is that a new mode is on the way, called Hide and Seek. It seems seekers will be given a very small radius in which they can see other players, leaving it up to those hiding to out-manoeuvre their pursuers. 
And that's not the only major gameplay change - after modders started doing it themselves, some new roles are officially being added to the mix, including Sheriff and Scientist roles. As of yet there's no details on how these work (even on the roadmap explainer page), so I imagine this will be explained at a later date.

Salt and Sacrifice, much like its predecessor, sports side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat. This time, however, players, in the role of a Marked Inquisitor, can choose from one of eight classes - Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage - as they battle their way through the world of Alterstone Kingdom.
"Track down over 20 types of Mages in abandoned villages, dungeons, tomb-temples, and more," explains Ska in its announcement. "Ransack their remains to forge new weapons and armour with Runic Arts and become even stronger for the battles ahead."

The game was first announced back at E3 2018, but a series of delays saw its release date pushed back to 2021. Players take on the role of Sable, and embark on a rite of passage that sees her leave her tribe to explore the world on her hoverbike. It's got a gorgeous art style that's inspired by French artist Mobieus, and a sci-fi open world that feels very reminiscent of some of the wrecks seen in Star Wars. Oh, and it's set to launch on PC and Xbox. 
Sable is being developed by a small team in the UK called Shedworks, who - you guessed it - work out of a garden shed. I visited Shedworks back in 2018 to learn about Sable's story - and also check out the shed for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, developer Iron Gate released a pretty ambitious roadmap for Valheim that included several major updates and a host of smaller improvements: but as the months passed, it began to seem less and less likely that Iron Gate would meet all these targets. Sure enough, the Iron Gate team has confirmed that it's had to revise its roadmap for 2021 - and that includes a trimmed-down version of its update schedule. 
"As we're sure lots of you suspected, we won't be able to deliver four updates this year," Iron Gate explained in an update post on Steam. "Instead, we're now planning to launch Hearth and Home in Q3 2021, and we're temporarily taking down the roadmap whilst we make some changes. We are sorry it's taken us so long to update you."
Iron Gate went on to explain that it hadn't been prepared for "such a large influx of players", and the game's popularity highlighted plenty of bugs that needed urgent fixes. "Our priority has been to make the current experience as stable as possible and this has meant new content has taken a backseat. To put it clearly; we haven't been able to focus all of our resources on Hearth and Home until May.

Speaking at part of a pre-E3, "What's Next for Gaming" virtual briefing shown to press this week, Spencer took aim at Sony's strategy of releasing its PlayStation-exclusives on PC years after they come out on console.

Liz Hamren, CVP of Gaming Experiences & Platforms, said Microsoft was already working on new hardware, "some of which won't come to light for years."
"Cloud is key to our hardware and Game Pass roadmaps, but no one should think we're slowing down on our core console engineering. In fact, we're accelerating it," Hamren said in a video briefing shown to press this week.

Spyro will make an appearance, but can you actually play as Spyro? It looks like you'll get a Spyro-themed skin for Crash - so maybe that's as close as it gets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG's bots have never been particularly popular with the community ever since they were introduced to public matchmaking, but a recent update transformed the bumbling bots into something far worse: horrifyingly accurate aimbots. 
Patch 12.1 brought with it some changes to bot AI, which were - in theory - supposed to improve their behaviour, but it seems PUBG Corp made them a little too good. Players took to Reddit to document these machines of terror, pointing out that they were behaving like cheaters. Those who spectated the bots or replayed death cams discovered they effectively had wall hacks and aimbot enabled, with the bots spinning around to obliterate players with unnerving speed and accuracy. 
"They're 'aim bots' now and that's no joke," said appropriately-named Reddit user Morbidly Tortured. "I got taken out by a bot from 200 meters out. It auto locked on to me and hit every shot. I almost reported it until I spectated for about three minutes and noticed it was a bot with how it was running, stopping, going prone."

The PC version of this action game collection is bare bones, with severely limited customisation and graphics options.
It does not support mouse and keyboard, forcing PC users to play with a controller. A controller is perhaps preferable for Ninja Gaiden, but to not provide the option of mouse and keyboard is shocking.

Game director Aaron Keller announced the feature during Blizzard's latest developer update, working through some of the special matchmaking rules that'll be introduced once cross-play arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
Essentially, while parties of console-only players will continue to be placed with other consoles players during matchmaking, and those on PC will continue to be placed with other PC players, mixed teams will be placed in the PC matchmaking pool. The one exception to this is Competitive Play mode, which will not permit mixed groups at all.

The current 1984 version of Verdansk map launched in April - half a year after Treyarch's Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War came out.

With the vaccine rollout now in progress, it seems some companies are making plans for what their workplace structure will look like in the future - and that includes Ubisoft. 
Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier earlier this week tweeted that Ubisoft had emailed employees about a new "hybrid" work structure, and Ubisoft has now published this email on its official website.
"In summary the future will be hybrid, offering the majority of Ubisoft team members the opportunity to balance home and office work," the post explains. "This has been designed based on our learnings from the past year and from your feedback; this 'test and learn' approach is one we will continue to adopt moving forward."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a string of rumours, whispers and leaks EA has finally lifted the veil of the latest Battlefield, seeing the flagship first-person shooter moving away from the historical setting of recent entries to a near-future backdrop - with this year's model subsequently called Battlefield 2042. In a break from other recent traditions, it'll also do away with a single-player campaign, and there are no plans for an accompanying battle royale mode.
Battlefield 2042 will instead focus on its multiplayer offering, supporting 128 players on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game support 64 players. There will also be the option of playing against AI bots, either solo or with a squad of friends. 
"I think that's just something that enables us to really lean into what we are best at," Battlefield 2042 design director Daniel Berlin told Eurogamer about the lack of a single-player campaign - something that's been a series mainstay since Battlefield 3. "If you look at the DNA of the studio, what we've been doing for so long, we just said you know what, we're not going to have a traditional single-player campaign this time around, but we're going to put all that emphasis and all those resources into building depth into the multiplayer. Because that is what we do best."

The update, which brings the PS5 up to version 21.01-03.20.00 (just rolls off the tongue!) makes a short list of changes, as detailed on the PlayStation website:
Of note is the update to the DualSense controller. Sony said it improves stability, which isn't particularly helpful. Redditor Heymodspleasehelp noticed a controller battery indicator bug was now fixed. "It was at zero percent before I updated now it's at two bars," they said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's laid back Team Rumble mode has been quietly revamped as part of the game's new extraterrestrial season - and fans aren't best pleased with the changes. 
Tweaks to Team Rumble's relaxed formula had felt overdue, as things had begun to feel a little too relaxed in recent months and it had become common for matches to peter out towards the end. 
But Epic's unexplained changes - apparently designed to speed up the mode's pacing and match length - have gone overboard, fans say, and ruin the ability to use Team Rumble to check off in-game challenges.

It&#8217;s possible, though very difficult, to back away from our current situation towards one of greater democratic stability. This wouldn&#8217;t entail a restoration of a previous status quo. Instead, it would recognize that the status quo was less stable than it seemed, and a major source of the tensions that have started to unravel it. What we need is a dynamic stability, one that incorporates new forces into American democracy rather than trying to deny or quash them...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just in time for the launch of Marvel's new Disney+ show Loki, the Disney+ 30-day trial has returned to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving members a free month of access to the streaming service. 
As explained on Xbox Wire, the free trial can be claimed through Xbox Game Pass Perks, and can be activated any time from now until 30th September. If you claimed the previous Disney+ Perk, you should still be able to claim this one - but it can only be activated on a new Disney+ subscriber account. 
If you're thinking of only using the trial for that 30-day period, remember that like most subscription trials you'll need to manually cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period if you don't want to get charged for the next month. So if you're planning on tuning in just for Loki, you might want to wait a bit before activating your trial: the first episode releases today, but the finale airs on 14th July. Or for Clone Wars spin-off series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, you'll want to make sure your trial period includes the finale airing on 30th July.

This is the first of Ubisoft's upcoming big budget free-to-play experiments with its core franchises. A few bits and pieces have leaked out from closed testing, despite Ubisoft's wishes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're still waiting for that big Heath and Home update, but in the meantime developer Iron Gate has rolled out another small patch to fix some of Valheim's bugs. This patch makes two previously-bugged raid events actually trigger in-game, and provides a number of other handy fixes to make your time in the 10th world slightly easier. Slightly. 
The two events fixed in this update are "you are being hunted" and "the horde is attacking", which were previously in the game files but didn't trigger as expected. According to the Valheim wiki, the hunt event is supposed to spawn a bunch of wolves, while the horde event should summon a goblin army of Fulings (including Berserkers and Shamans). 
The exact conditions for triggering these events are currently unknown, but the pattern established by previous events suggests the hunt event could require killing one wolf and Moder, while the horde raid should occur in-between killing Moder and the final boss. So if you're currently in the late-game, things are about to get a bit spicier.

Descenders, if you're unfamiliar, serves up an exhilarating freeriding experience as players - either solo or competitively - race, trick, and flip their way across a procedurally generated world. It was warmly received at launch, but really made its mark - and found a significant audience - once it released on Xbox Game Pass.
Following the game's well-deserved, and continuing, success on Microsoft's subscription service, RageSquid announced it was working on a next-gen enhancements upgrade for Xbox Series X/S - and that update is now finally here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playdate, the mini monochrome handheld with a crank, will become available for pre-order in July priced $179 (UK price TBA). 
The exact date will be announced closer to the time, with a week's warning so you can be ready. The first units are "expected" to ship later in 2021.
Those details are different to those first announced back in May 2019, when the price was mentioned as $149. But Playdate's offering has now been improved, with a 4GB memory instead of 2GB, and an initial 24 game season: double the games originally planned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have already seen some mutterings about this on social media, but E3's online portal opened up to press this week - and to nobody's surprise, it's a real mess. This year's E3 is all-online thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and the portal is supposed to be some sort of substitute for the physical show, featuring virtual booths for exhibitors, online events, and a variety of articles and bits of content about games.
The portal goes a little further than you might expect, however, with old-school internet forums, an avatar system and a gamified rewards system. The latter is what really caught my attention, as not only can you earn points from nosing around the portal, but you can also compete in online leaderboards  to see who is The Biggest E3 Fan. Naturally, this appealed to my competitive side and I set out to land myself a spot at the top of the virtual podium. "With a limited pool of games media, this will be a cinch," I thought. But alas, my attempts to do so were foiled by an unexpected enemy: the E3 portal itself. 
Things started off pretty well. After doing some strange password reset shenanigans to actually get into my account, the E3 website presented me with an avatar creator (if you've ever heard of a picrew, it's basically that). I don't know why the avatar creator exists, but I think it might also be the best part of the E3 website. It's surprisingly lenient with what it will allow you to do - there are colour wheels for your hair and eyes, and you can even move your facial features around. Don't expect the sort of silliness you can get from something like Nintendo's Mii Maker, but the E3 avatar creator isn't afraid to get a little weird:

Expect updates on what's next for Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Rise, as well as a look ahead to July's Monster Hunter Stories 2 and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.
So, what do we expect for Resident Evil Village? Well, Capcom is yet to talk about post-launch single-player support for the game, if there is any. More likely, perhaps, we may get a glimpse of new bits and pieces coming to its PVE Mercenaries mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is your Russian feeling a little rusty? Not to worry, as an English translation for Fallout 2 mod Olympus 2207 has finally been released - so you can put the Russian dictionary down for now. 
Olympus 2207 is a huge total conversion mod for Fallout 2 that was released back in December 2014, and at long last, it now has an official English translation. The developers used Fallout 2's engine and basic mechanics to create a new story that's unconnected to the Fallout series: it adapts features like Fallout 2's skills and perks system, but adds new graphics, additional gameplay mechanics, and - of course - a bunch of new stories and quests. There's even a crafting system, a mini-game for hacking electronic panels, and a flexible structure with no main quest. "Do you want to become the tyrant of Radius, or do you want to improve the lives of everyone in it?," the official mod page explains. "The choice is yours!"
As explained in the lore section of the mod's website, the game takes place in the year 2207 in the Silicon Valley region of the US. The Great War of 2013 created an irradiated wasteland, and while some managed to escape into improvised shelters (or a luxurious vault called Livos), many had to "adapt to the new conditions on the evolutionary, genetic level". Sounds rough. Anyway, some lucky survivors found themselves inside a skyscraper called Olympus when this all went down. The game centres on this skyscraper, which everyone in the wasteland seems desperate to enter: it promises energy with its solar panels and protection from the horrors outside. If you can get past the guards at the bottom, however.

There's also a revamped battle pass system which has done away with the traditional levels 1-100 grind. Instead, levelling will give you "Stars" to spend on specific rewards you want, laid out over pages. Some items will require you to have finished off the rest of the page first, tempting you to level up further, but this should make nabbing individual items easier.
In the story trailer, we see the Fortnite island's inhabitants react to the arrival of an Independence Day-sized UFO, which hovers over the island and then appears to suck up its Zero Point energy source, destroying last season's Spire and primal ruins in the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has been delayed twice since its initial unveiling last September, now won't arrival until some time next year.
Originally, the Sands of Time remake - which is being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai - was due to launch this January, but the publisher postponed its release to March at the end of last year. When February arrived, however, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the game once more, this time indefinitely, while it worked on delivering "a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original".
All's been quite on the news front since then, but in a new statement posted to Twitter - ostensibly confirming that the remake will be absent from this year's Ubisoft Forward livestream - the publisher has shared a revised release window of 2022 for the remake.

Yes, those deafening mass relay jumps are now quieter - something many fans had called on BioWare to fix for years.

The freeze on withdrawals was a consequence of King being investigated by PayPal over how Royal Games operates in specific countries. 
After a lengthy investigation by Eurogamer, the site's withdrawal page has now become available again, though the site continues to no longer accept real-world money deposits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the start of the weekend we heard that CD Projekt's stolen data was being shared online, and it seems the floodgates are now well and truly open. A bunch of dev-made bug compilation videos are now circulating on social media and file-sharing sites, showing some rarely-seen work-in-progress builds and rather spectacular bugs.  
As Eurogamer reported on Friday, some dev videos had already started to leak alongside the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 and Thronebreaker, and it appears many of these are now being shared on 4chan, Reddit and YouTube. Most of the videos are being shared using video hosting platform Streamable, but many are now being pulled offline (they are, after all, the result of an illegal ransomware hack). 
Some are short clips showing the player-character being ricocheted into the sky to the sound of Shooting Stars, or being knocked out only to wake up to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim opening. Others are more complex - one compilation shows several bugs with an off-tune recorder version of Spoiler (the track by DJ Hyper used in Cyberpunk's 2018 E3 trailer). Another lengthy edit called "CyberElBuggado2020" shows hotdog motorbikes, NPCs T-posing to the sound of Thriller, and Johnny Silverhand saying "this is going to be a disaster" in Spanish.

On his departure from Square Enix, Naka said: "I can't talk about the reason now, but I hope I can talk about it when the time comes. As for future activities, I'm 55 years old, so I may retire."

As reported by Polygon, designer Judy A. Juracek filed a lawsuit in a Connecticut court on Friday that alleges Capcom used unlicensed copyrighted photos for the creation of some of its games - and even for the Resident Evil 4 logo.
At the heart of this lawsuit is Juracek's book, Surfaces, a visual research for artists, architects and designers that includes 1200 photographs of textures she took herself. Surfaces, which was originally published in 1996, includes a CD-ROM of the images, which require a licence for commercial use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvelous and Grasshopper Manufacture's cult-hack-and-slash adventures No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle are heading to Steam next Wednesday, 9th June.
First released on Wii in 2007, No More Heroes follows the stylish, frequently ludicrous, and dependably ultra-violent adventures of Travis Touchdown, an ordinary game and anime geek who inadvertently becomes embroiled with the United Assassins Association.
What follows is a third-person hack-and-slash romp, replete with a phenomenal soundtrack, that sees Travis - lightsaber-like beam Katana in hand - murdering his way through the Association's top-ranked assassins in order to stay alive. If you've never played the game before, expect geysers of blood, a winningly weird sense of humour, and (rather barren) bike-based open-world interludes in amongst the spirited and largely entertaining action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its surprise appearance during a fiscal year financial presentation last week, publisher 505 Games has confirmed that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the acclaimed 2019 Castlevania spiritual successor from Koji Igarashi and developer ArtPlay, is getting a sequel.
Word of a sequel originally surfaced after keen-eyed internet sorts spotted a bullet point inserted into 505 Games' latest fiscal year financial results, stating a "second version" of  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was in development.
Although the term "second version" left a certain ambiguity as to whether this was referring to a sequel or something else, 505 has now offered clarity in a development update on Reddit. "Regarding recent reports," it wrote, "[505 Games and Artplay] are in very early planning stages for a Bloodstained sequel".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Summer Games Done Quick, which will once again be an online-only event due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, starts in exactly one month's time, on 4th July, and in preparation, organisers have shared the full charity speedrun schedule.
2021 marks the second year running that Summer Games Done Quick is going online-only - traditionally, shows have been ticketed real-world events, with all speedrunning showcases being streamed online - and the precautions established last year will remain in place to "ensure the continued safety of our attendees, runners, volunteers, and staff", according to organisers.
Even without the live-event element, there's still plenty to look forward to, with this year's show offering a full seven days of speedrunning, from Sunday, 4th July, to 11th July.

        <updated>2021-06-04T15:50:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, CD Projekt confirmed it had been hit by a "targeted cyber attack" that saw its internal systems compromised and sensitive information held to ransom. After CD Projekt said it would not comply with the group's demands, the hackers announced that source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent and an unreleased version of The Witcher 3 would be auctioned to the highest bidder, and source code for Gwent was publicly leaked. 
At the time, the hackers claimed they had received a satisfying offer for the information, and the auction was then closed with a condition of "no further distribution" agreed with the buyer. But that stolen data now appears to have resurfaced, with source code, assets and software development kits for platforms including the PlayStation 5 seemingly being shared online. Eurogamer has also seen internal development videos showing work-in-progress builds of Cyberpunk 2077. 
According to security blog DataBreaches.net, earlier this week a threat actor group decided to release CD Projekt's information in order to promote its new leaks platform. A note from the hackers was also discovered by security software provider Emsisoft back in March (via IT Pro), and an uncensored version of this was shared on 4chan yesterday (the link provided in the note no longer works, but the data is now being shared elsewhere). The note claims the release of the stolen information is part of a "charity fundraising" effort - although as the group is asking for payment in cryptocurrency, there's no way to guarantee that's actually going to a good cause.

The mobile version of NetherRealm's fighting game was accused of being "tone deaf" after an in-game challenge designed to celebrate Pride Month tasked players with defeating canonically bisexual character Poison Ivy hundreds of thousands of times.
Rewards for completing the community challenge included Harley Quinn tokens - a nod to Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn's romantic relationship in DC Comics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has once again turned its attention to virtual reality of the PlayStation kind, with another of its PSVR showcases - and if you missed its various announcements, you can catch up below.
First up, Sniper Elite VR - unsurprisingly a virtual reality spin on developer Rebellion's long-range FPS series - will be launching on 8th July. The studio is promising a "powerful World War 2 story" told through the eyes of an Italian Partisan, said to deliver a "new perspective" on the franchise's acclaimed stealth and sniping action.
Next up is a reveal for new game Wanderer, created by M Theory and Oddboy. This one's an immersive time travel adventure - melding narrative-driven exploration, puzzling, and mini-games - in which you're able to embody some of history's most famous explorers, inventors, and conquerors as you hop back and forth between ancient civilisations, war time, the hippie-hued 60s, even the far flung, post-apocalyptic future. Wanderer is due to arrive this summer.

        <link href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-03-rusts-new-contact-system-will-help-you-tell-friend-from-foe"/>
        <updated>2021-06-03T19:04:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust is infamous for having a pretty hostile player base - something I learned the hard way when I first started playing - but a change arriving this month could make it easier to avoid your worst neighbours. A new "contact system" is being rolled out as part of Rust's June update, and it will highlight those who have done bad things to you. 
"Upon meeting a new player they'll be logged into your contacts and the contact system will now keep a history of all interactions (good, bad, indifferent, rage-inducing etc)," Facepunch explained in a press release. "To help quickly identify friend from foe, players' nameplates will now display blue for friendly and red for hostile. Waving at players will reveal your name (it doesn't always pay to be nice...) and using binoculars will reveal if a player is unknown, hostile or friendly from large distances."
On the surface, it sounds similar to the way hostile players are marked in Red Dead Online with a red dot or star depending on their recent actions. With Rust, however, it seems like it will be up to the individual to categorise other players: you can designate someone as an enemy, for instance, and make notes on each player you meet. Seems like a handy way to keep track of all those nakeds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontier has released a second major update for space sim Elite Dangerous' poorly received Odyssey expansion, bringing a raft of much-needed improvements, ranging from UI enhancements and graphics optimisations to AI tweaks and many, many bug fixes.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched last month, quickly accruing a 'Mostly Negative' rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.
As the negative reviews continued, Frontier Developments boss David Braben stepped in, releasing a statement apologising "to those who have been suffering from these problems" and insisting that addressing Odyssey's myriad reported issues was the studio's "priority and focus."

Frostpunk, which launched to much acclaim in 2018, is a fascinating, if decidedly gruelling, experience. It's a sort of narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder, challenging players to stay alive and, as much as is possible in Frostpunk's desolate sub-zero world, thrive.
That's done by establishing a settlement with a vast generator at its centre, a precariously fuel-hungry device intended to provide some degree of warmth for your population as, at your command, they set about scavenging the land for supplies needed to expand their new home.

It's an MMO I've been following since it Kickstarted in 2015 (after which it raised more money via player investment and in-game property sales), and one I've played a bit of recently. It's a slightly tricky one to explain.
In general, it's an online fantasy game about fighting other players. That is the point. There's a bit of monster fighting, but only really to serve as a tutorial while you quickly level up. There's a level-cap of 30 which you can get quite close to in a few hours if you're speedy.

        <link href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-03-respawn-making-huge-steps-towards-fixing-ddos-problem-in-apex-legends"/>
        <updated>2021-06-03T11:05:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few months, Apex Legends players have increasingly reported problems with DDoS attacks in their games: one moment they've been sliding their way around World's Edge, the next, their game has frozen and they've been booted out. It's become a particular issue in Ranked games, where miscreants have used DDoS attacks to artificially boost themselves up the leaderboards. Hoovering up a bunch of disconnected opponents is easier than actually playing the game, after all. 
Respawn has already indicated it's taking the situation seriously - banning some behind high-profile cases, and mentioning that it's even considering legal action against those carrying out the attacks. But it seems progress is being made towards a more permanent solution, with security analyst Conor "Hideouts" Ford explaining on Twitter that significant progress has been made on a fix. 
"The DDoS situation is being addressed as we speak by our very own @ricklesauceur [lead software engineer Samy Duc]," Ford said. "It isn't the easiest fix in the world but huge steps are being made to take care of this."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bend Studio, perhaps best known as the developer behind 2019's post-apocalyptic bikes-and-zombies adventure Days Gone, has revealed it's working on a new IP.
Days Gone - which initially launched on PS4 before making it way to PC earlier this year - was the studio's first crack at a new IP since its acquisition by Sony in 2000; prior to that game, the developer was largely known for adapting the likes of Uncharted and Resistance for Sony's handheld consoles, the PSP and Vita.
Announcing its next project in a statement on Twitter,  Bend wrote, "We are beyond grateful for your support with Days Gone and are truly honoured by the amount of passion our community has shared with us for our world and characters. Your enthusiasm motivates us to continue to improve and create experiences that will last a lifetime."

Prisms, No Man's Sky's 17th named update since its release back in 2016, touches up the game's visual presentation pretty much across the board. Planets, for instance, get enhanced weather effects - Hello Games highlights rain, which now refracts the light and causes surfaces to become slick and wet - while underground caves become more detailed, with improved lighting and volumetric fog.
Planetary fauna, meanwhile, has been overhauled with proper fur effects and, as a bonus, flying creatures - which were sadly neglected in No Man's Sky's taming-based Companions update - can now be adopted and ridden through the sky.

Writing on the Mass Effect reddit, former BioWare designer Richard Boisvert explained the Easter egg was his creation, and there was a specific path players had to follow in order to see it properly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Biomutant developer Experiment 101 has, as promised, released an update for the game that makes significant changes.
Chief among them is the ability to shut the annoying narrator up. Biomutant's incorporeal narrator is certainly pretty chatty, commenting on pretty much everything you do and translating everything anyone says. Prior to the release of this patch, while you were able to tone the narrator down, you couldn't shut him up completely. Now you can.
Here are the relevant patch notes:

As officially released, Super Mario Bros. was 104 minutes. This new version - dubbed the Morton Jankel Cut in honour of its husband and wife director team - runs 125 minutes, with most scenes extended.

Announced last summer, New Genesis is described as the "next-generation" of Phantasy Star Online 2, and catapults the action forward 1,000 years after the Oracle's battle in PSO2.
Bundled alongside the base game, it includes a new graphics engine, enhanced character models, a new multi-weapon system, and, most notably, a "wide-open battlefield" with changing time and weather, traversable using new abilities like the Photon Dash and Photon Glide. There's also cross-platform play, plus fully localised text and character voices in English.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All three episodes of Life is Strange developer Dontnod's well-received supernatural mystery adventure Tell Me Why are currently free on PC and Xbox.
Tell Me Why, if you're unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the picturesque Alaskan town of Delos Crossing - a task that ultimately forces them to confront their traumatic past.
What follows is a deft blend of supernatural mystery thriller and earnest, character-driven homecoming drama - there's real beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists - that's arguably Dontnod's most assured, consistently enjoyable outing yet, even if its perhaps not quite as devastatingly memorable as its Life is Strange forebears.

This week the British developer announced it had wrapped up work on Total War: Three Kingdoms with the 1.7.1 patch. No more DLC or patches will be released for the game, which broke series records upon launch in May 2019.

In the patch notes for Sim Update 4, aka patch 1.16.20.0, the development team said it had performed optimisations for the initial full download of Microsoft Flight Simulator so the base game is 83GB instead of over 170GB.
It's good news to see the game's download halved, although 83GB is still a chunky old effort.

That's according to a single, and only mildly informative, slide found within publisher 505 Games' latest fiscal year financial results presentation (as spotted by Gematsu) - which, as well as noting that Bloodstained has now sold more than 1m copies, amassing over €30m in sales, confirms a "second version" is currently in development.
As Gematsu points out, "second version", although a somewhat unusual turn of phrase in this context, appears throughout the presentation in conjunction with other properties that have confirmed sequels, such as One More Level's action-parkour game Ghostrunner.

But, tellingly, GAME's terms and conditions for this offer make it clear that this is only open to the public - and not to "trade" resellers looking for a quick profit.
"GAME reserves the right to refuse any offer to anyone believed to be representing a trade buyer/customer," the chain states. In other words, if you manage a CEX, no telling your staff to go upgrade dozens of knackered Xbox Ones for Series S to just resell the newer consoles for profit. This may well apply if you're an organised scalper, too.

The social deduction game, which originally released in 2018 but became enormously popular during the lockdowns of 2020, is free as part of Epic's ongoing Mega Sale (which lasts until 17th June). Those who have an Epic Games Store account can grab Among Us for free until 3rd June.
Once you've claimed the free game, you'll have access to new map The Airship, and be able to play with friends on other platforms like Switch, Android and iOS. The game is due to arrive on PlayStation later this year, too, so hopefully there won't be any problems with cross-play there.

2013's Company of Heroes 2 is widely regarded as one of the best RTS games around. "While Company of Heroes 2 sometimes makes you feel like you're fighting the game as well as the enemy, if you take time to understand the systems at work beneath the carnage and pick and choose your battles wisely, you will ultimately be rewarded by a deep and enjoyable RTS," wrote Stace Harman in Eurogamer's Company of Heroes 2 review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 has a new game director - and it's former creative director Gabriel Amatangelo. 
Amatangelo joined CD Projekt back in January 2020, and will now take over from former game director Adam Badowski. According to a report by GamesIndustry.biz, Badowski will now focus on other leadership duties within CD Projekt, including the company's new "strategic development framework" that will see the Cyberpunk and Witcher brands developed in parallel. 
Before becoming a creative director for Cyberpunk 2077, Amatangelo also worked as a design director on Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC, and lead designer on several expansions for Star Wars: The Old Republic. Cyberpunk 2077's roadmap indicates that we should see several free DLCs for the game over the next year, and Amatangelo certainly has some experience in this area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as it promised, Sony has pulled back the veil on Guerrilla Games' highly anticipated Horizon Forbidden West, sharing 14 minutes of gorgeous gameplay running on PlayStation 5.
As you can see in the video below, it's an immediate feast for the eyes, beginning as Aloy scrambles through dense jungle foliage before stumbling out onto a oceanside settlement, all sandy beaches, deep blue water, and vast rock spires on the horizon, shrouded in clouds. These, Guerrilla later confirms, are the remnants of San Francisco, millennia into the future, and it's here that Aloy encounters machine-riding raiders, immediately embarking on some nimble combat, firing arrows and hurtling acrobatically around the environment to escape their attack.
This initial sequence ends beneath the waves as Aloy swims through gorgeous coral reefs, kelp, and exotic fauna, fighting the current as she goes. Eventually she reaches dry land and encounters the raiders once more, this time choosing to take a more stealthy approach as she attempts to liberate her kidnapped friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Techland's parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel, Dying Light 2, has - after a rather tumultuous few years of development - finally received a release date. It'll be coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 7th December, and Techland has released a brand-new gameplay trailer to accompany the news.
Dying Light 2 is set 20 years after the events of the first game, in a world devastated by a mutated version of the original virus. With over 98% of the population now lost, the remnants of humanity have congregated in the sprawling metropolis of Villedor, also known as The City, and it's here that new protagonist Aiden Caldwell finds himself while searching for his family.
To date, Techland has really only painted the ensuing adventure in broad strokes, talking up key points such as Dying Light 2's 2-4 player co-op, its returning day and night cycle, and its focus on choice and consequence. Today's developer livestream didn't go too much further than those core concepts, but did flesh them out with a few additional details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic's 30th anniversary livestream has come and gone, leaving a big blue streak in its wake, and while it wasn't perhaps the most revelatory of showings, Sega did at least confirm the previously rumoured Sonic Colors remaster and retro Sonic collection - as well as providing the tiniest teases of Sonic's next major game.
Starting with the remaster, it's called Sonic Colors Ultimate and will be heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (exclusively via the Epic Games Store) on 7th September this year.
As those who've played the 2010 original will know, Sonic Colors transports the iconic mascot to Dr. Robotnik's interstellar theme park for a familiar blend of appropriately high-speed into-the-screen and side-on platforming, with the hedgehog able to access handy new skills, such as a speed boost or the ability to drill underground, thanks to friendly Wisps.

The original Aragami sold 700k copies and helped grow Lince Works as a studio, the developer said in a release today, meaning Aragami 2 is now the work of a more experienced and larger team. Combat has been overhauled, and looks sneakier than ever. Here's a peek:

In a tweet sent this afternoon, Pitchford said that while a Borderlands 3 update had been prepared for release "that includes full crossplay support across all platforms", PlayStation will ultimately not be included.
Pitchford did not detail why, upon submitting the patch for certification, Gearbox was then forced to remove crossplay by the game's publisher 2K. Did Sony suddenly decide to take issue with the game's long-promised crossplay becoming a reality? Or did Gearbox and/or 2K decide not to play by Sony's rules? Pitchford has so far chosen not to elaborate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot more to Sony's PlayStation investor relations document than confirmation Uncharted 4 is coming to PC.
The document, published as part of Sony's 2021 investor relations day, focuses on the company's Game & Network Services Segment. It's penned by PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, and includes a number of interesting bits of information that reveal Sony's masterplan for its money-printing video games business.
At the beginning, Sony mentions it's "building our biggest-ever platform" with PlayStation 5, and that it's working to ensure "our longest-ever tail" with the PS4. PS5 has delivered PlayStation's highest-ever launch sales, with 7.8m units sold as of the end of Sony's last financial year (ending March 2021).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go has detailed Go Fest 2021, its massive summer event weekend, which will offer an eye-catching array of creatures to capture for a particularly eye-opening price.
This year, tickets for the two-day affair cost just £5 (or $5), a third of 2020's fee. Once again, there will be no physical event, and all players will be able to take part wherever they are. 
There will also be plenty to do for people who don't purchase a ticket.

The video, currently available to watch on the Battlefield subreddit (with an epilepsy warning), confirms a near future setting for the upcoming DICE-developed game.
We also hear soldiers shout, a rocket attempt to launch into space before collapsing onto the ground, and, at the end, a reveal of the title "Battlefield".

That's the eye-watering amount EA made during its 2021 financial year from Ultimate Team modes across its sports games.
But - and this won't come as a surprise to anyone - FIFA Ultimate Team made the bulk of that money. Or, as EA recently put it in a regulatory financial document, "a substantial portion".

In a document published as part of Sony's Investor Relations day, Sony mentions Uncharted 4 under "more PC releases planned" (it's on page 26).
Sony is putting more of its PlayStation 4 games on PC. It's already released Guerrilla's Horizon: Zero Dawn on PC and, most recently, Sony Bend's Days Gone. It makes sense that Naughty Dog's five-year-old adventure game would be part of Sony's PC push.

I understand this is to ensure third-parties working on games which support the upgraded Switch are free to announce these projects at E3, and before Nintendo's own digital showcase later in that week. 
(Nintendo's event has yet to be formally dated but is currently set to slot in after other publishers towards the end of E3, though of course dates can still shift.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Quest celebrated its 35th anniversary in some style in the early hours of this morning, with a livestream from Japan heralding the announcement of a string of new entries and spin-offs for the much-loved RPG series.
Heading the lot was Dragon Quest 12, which will be the first mainline entry since 2017. Not much was shown beyond a brief trailer revealing a logo - though that logo did reveal a turn towards dark fantasy, and what series' creator dubbed a Dragon Quest 'for adults'. It's being primed for a simultaneous worldwide release - in what would be a first for a mainline entry - though the timing has yet to be revealed, while no platforms have been announced just yet. 
Elsewhere, a remake of Dragon Quest 3 was announced, taking on the 2D/3D stylings of the likes of Octopath Traveler - and being ushered into existence by Octopath Traveler producer Masaaki Hayasaka. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D, as it's somewhat clumsily called at present, again has no release date or confirmed platforms, though it is also slated for a worldwide simultaneous release and we were afforded a look at it in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a little over two weeks away from this year's attempt at an online-only E3, meaning everyone'll soon be sinking into the familiar swamp of showcase schedules and diary dates required to keep track of the event and everything around it. Wisely starting early to avoid the ensuing scramble, though, Microsoft has announced a 13th June air date for this year's E3-adjacent Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase.
It'll be a significant event for a number of reasons, not least because it's the first joint announcement show for the two companies following Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda last year, and things kick off at 10am PT on Sunday, 13th June - which, for us UK folk, equates to an entirely tolerable 6pm in the afternoon. It's a long one too, with Microsoft promising 90-minutes of announcements - hopefully that's a taut 90 minutes with none of the waffly filler it usually loves to pad out its livestreams with (hello Inside Xbox, I'm looking at you).
As you'd expect, there's little in the way of specific regarding the games we'll be seeing - all the better to retain that all-important element of surprise - and Microsoft is merely teasing a look at the "epic gaming lineup coming out of [the Bethesda] partnership, the incredible games coming to Xbox this holiday, upcoming releases on Xbox Game Pass, and more."

Last year's real-world BlizzCon was cancelled due to coronavirus-related "health and safety considerations", and its long-awaited digital-only replacement - formally titled BlizzConline - eventually took place in February this year. Since then, it's been unclear if Blizzard was still planning to press ahead with a proper large-scale physical gathering in 2021, perhaps around the early November weekend usually reserved for its BlizzCon shows.
In a new post on the BlizzCon website, however, show executive producer Saralyn Smith has now confirmed the 2021 event will not be going ahead.

Smith - whose other notable video game roles have included Ezio Auditore da Firenze in the Assassin's Creed series, Chris Redfield in the Resident Evil series, Batman in Batman: Arkham Oranges, and Mirage in Apex Legends - had voiced Sonic since 2010, even lending his vocal talents to the character in the Wreck-it-Ralph films.
However, back in January, Smith tweeted, "Welp, 10 years was an amazing run. Onward to new zones!", alongside an image of a broken blue heart. Sega later confirmed what fans had already suspected, announcing Smith's departure from the Sonic role.

An officially-licensed compilation of 18 Olympic sport mini-games, it will launch for PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Stadia and Xbox.
Of course, it's unsurprising Sega has left this news until so late. While the real-world Olympics are (currently) set to go ahead in July, a year later than originally planned, the debate continues on whether it is right to hold the games at all while many countries - not least its host, Japan - continue to struggle with the impacts of coronavirus.

Some of her flights are lasting a little longer than Respawn would like, it seems, and the developer has decided to clip her wings. 
As explained by associate live balance designer John Larson, players figured out that hovering with Valkyrie's jetpack currently costs very little fuel - and were using this to "take coffee breaks above the final fight in scrims". It reminds me a bit of when Fortnite players used planes to stay out of battles until the very last moment. 
In any case, the 10 percent fuel cost for hovering is now being removed entirely, and from Thursday onwards it will cost you the full 100 percent to hang around in the air. When asked why it was being removed rather than nerfed, Larson said that Respawn experimented with a 50-75 percent fuel cost, but found that this "didn't feel meaningfully different and still allowed Valk to stay airborne for too long in certain final rings.

And now there seems to be a western-themed PUBG game codenamed Project Cowboy on the way. 
South Korean media outlet Bloter spotted job adverts on Krafton's website for an "open-world shooting game" that will release on console and PC as an independent title (via Google Translate). Krafton apparently told Bloter that "Project Cowboy is a new IP game for Battleground developed by Krafton". PUBG dataminer PlayerIGN described it as "PUBG's western custom mode" with "old west guns only".   
Eurogamer contacted Krafton for comment, and was told the company has "nothing to share on Project Cowboy as of now".

Crimson Glow Valstrax, if the name sounds familiar, is a new variant of the Elder Dragon first introduced in Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, making its Rise debut with a new form and attacks. The beast is able to change the shape of it wings, notes Capcom, enabling it to fly freely through the sky and survive at unusually high altitudes.
As for the Apex Zinogre, it's a tougher version of the familiar Monster Hunter staple already in Rise, and features a striking new look with its golden fur and lightning. Capcom says it'll make an appearance in Rampage quests but can be tackled as part of a standard quest too.

The new games for Switch were announced back in February, and are essentially retro-style remakes of the original Diamond and Pearl games. In the overworld characters take on a chibi art style, but there are also full-size Pokémon battles. 
Another Sinnoh game arrives early next year, called Pokémon Legends Arceus, which sees players explore a more feudal version of the region with old school pokéballs - and you'll be tasked with creating the first ever Pokédex.

The first of these changes is the upcoming Miramar remaster, which is being rolled out in patch 12.1 (now live on PC test servers). Miramar has been tweaked and revamped before, but this time it's getting a "much larger remastering", using the technology used to improve other maps like Sanhok to tweak the "lighting, performance, graphical fidelity, topography, and of course special features". 
Players can also expect to find "overhauls to terrain and building textures and layouts, easier traversal with the removal of unnecessary obstacles, and even updated cliffs to better fit in the more vertical experience the game has become". PUBG Corp provided a helpful before and after so you can see exactly what the improvements will look like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve is reportedly readying to enter the hardware market once more, this time with a new "Switch-like" handheld gaming PC that could potentially launch by the end of the year.
That's according to a report by Ars Technica, which expands on the recent discovery of a new hardware-related code - referring to a mysterious device known as "SteamPal" - in the latest version of Steam. Citing "multiple sources familiar with the matter", Ars Technica claims this device (whose final name remains unconfirmed) is a new Valve-developed all-in-one portable gaming PC that features gamepad controls and a touchscreen in a similar form factor to Nintendo's Switch, albeit without detachable controllers.
SteamPal, or whatever it ends up being called (obviously, not calling it the Gabe Boy would be a serious missed opportunity), is reportedly designed to run a large number of games on the Steam PC platform via Linux, and can "dock" to a monitor via its USB Type-C port.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Magnificent Trufflepigs, a romantic first-person metal-detecting adventure from Andrew Crawshaw, lead designer on The Chinese Room's Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, now has a release date and will be making its way to PC next Wednesday, 2nd June.
Trufflepigs is the work of Crawshaw's Leeds-based studio Thunkd (which says it wants to become synonymous with "high-quality, short-form, 'evening-sized' games"), and tells the story of Adam - voiced by Doctor Who and Legends of Tomorrow's Arthur Darvill - as he returns to his childhood home in the heart of the English countryside.
What follows is a game of laid-back metal detecting and exploration with a "strong interpersonal narrative" as Adam reunites with old friend Beth (played by Safe House and Another Eden's Luci Fish) and joins her on a quest to find a local treasure connected to her past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axiom Verge 2, the sequel to developer Thomas Happ's acclaimed retro-styled Metroid-a-like, is delayed again, and is now expected to launch in the latter half of this year.
Happ had initially planned to launch Axiom Verge 2 on PC and Switch at some point in 2020, but ultimately opted to postpone release into the first half of this year for a variety of reasons. That window was later narrowed to "spring", but the developer has now announced an additional delay, pushing the game's release back to "Q3" 2021 - indicating it'll likely arrive between the start of July and the end of September.
"I could go into a long spiel about why it's taking longer than I originally forecast," Happ wrote in a post on his blog, "but I don't want to get too bogged down into technical details. Suffice it to say that the game will be better for the additional time, and I won't have to burn myself out crunching to hit a date that I set for myself."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wondering what Sonic's been up to lately? Well, it looks like Sega's poised to reveal all in a 30th anniversary livestream for the prickly blue icon, scheduled to take place this Thursday.
Sonic Central, as Sega's calling its digital showcase, gets underway at 5pm BST/9am PT this Thursday, 27th May, and promises a first look at a number of upcoming "projects, partnerships, and events" the company has been working on as part of its anniversary celebrations.
There's no hint as to what those might be as yet, but recent rumours have suggested Sega is prepping both a new collection of classic Sonic titles and a remaster of the hedgehog's 2010 outing Sonic Colors. Perhaps we'll also finally get a glimpse of Sonic's next major new game, which was confirmed to be in production back in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a busy day for developer Ion Lands; not only is its gorgeous Blade Runner-esque delivery thriller Cloudpunk's "sequel-sized" paid DLC, City of Ghosts, now available on PC, the studio has announced a new cyberpunk-themed life-sim spin-off too.
City of Angels, which seems as good a place as any to start, offers a brand-new, fully voiced story campaign that serves as a direct sequel to the original game. Main protagonist Rania and canine companion Camus return for another skyhigh HOVA-based jaunt around the neon-drenched metropolis of Nivalis, but this time there's a new hero - deadbeat gambler Hayse - with players switching between two interlinking stories as the adventure unfolds.
Ion Worlds says City of Angels is longer than the original story, as well as "darker, tenser, more complex", and promises new areas to explore, new characters and mysteries, HOVA customisation, street racing, and different endings depending on player choices. It's out now on Steam for £12.99/$14.99 USD, and there's a 10% launch day discount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember bird dating sim Hatoful Boyfriend? It's hard to forget, to be honest, but if you haven't yet bought it on iOS, Android or the PlayStation Store then your time is limited, as the game is being delisted from these platforms at the end of May. 
Manga artist and Hatoful Boyfriend creator Hato Moa announced the news on her Twitter account earlier this week, explaining that both Hatoful Boyfriend and its seasonal sequel Holiday Star will no longer be purchasable on these platforms as "publishing agreements on those platforms are coming to an end". Those who already bought the games through these platforms will still be able to use them, however, while the games will remain on sale via Steam. 
If you missed it the first time around, well, Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel about dating birds that was released back in 2014. I guess you can say it's been out for aviary long time. You play as the only human student accepted into a school for birds, where you must navigate classes and build relationships with talking birds. It's all pretty eccentric, but the game earned itself a cult following and critical acclaim for the quality of its character writing.

This morning, Fortnite received update 16.50, the last patch expected before its next season on 7th June. Eagle-eyed fans immediately noticed several changes around the island: a crashed helicopter near the dam, posters showing UFOs and friendly aliens at the beach, and flattened corn at the farm. 
3pm UK time today brought a new set of "Foreshadowing" challenges live, where you're asked to investigate that helicopter, as well as a series of smashed telescopes on the island. Does someone not want its inhabitants looking at the skies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A much-requested feature has finally been introduced to Apex Legends' Arenas mode, as the 3v3 team deathmatches now have a leaving penalty - something that should hopefully deter players from flaking on their squadmates. 
Several changes were announced via patch notes posted on Twitter, including the new abandon penalty for Arenas games. Respawn explained that this is similar to the penalty for Ranked Battle Royale games, and will apply to those who leave a full squad in the middle of a match. 
Unfortunately it seems a couple of people are currently getting unfairly punished by the new penalty, with some reporting being slapped with 10-minute sin bins for leaving during the end screen animations. Director of communications Ryan K. Rigney assured one player that the team was investigating the problem.

The gameplay, which you can see in the video below, is narrated by game director Jeff Lydell and design director Ian Christy from developer Gasket Games. We see a small group of Stormcast Eternals during a mid-to-late battle of the campaign against a modest Nighthaunt army.
The Stormcast Eternals' numbers are few, so Lydell makes smart use of his units' skills as well as knowledge of the environment (pushback, high ground bonuses, lethal hazards etc) to win the assasination mission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an agonisingly long hiatus Sega's much-loved fighting series Virtua Fighter is back, with a remaster of the most recent game coming to PlayStation 4 next month. 
Virtua Fighter: Ultimate Showdown looks to be a remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, the last installment which hit arcades way back in 2010. Final Showdown was itself the last iteration of Virtua Fighter 5, folding in new characters Taka-Arashi and Jean Kujo as well as introducing a more athletic moveset for its cast. We wrote some nice things about it in our Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown review upon its console launch in 2012. 
Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown saw the series bow out at its peak, although it's been kept alive in some way via appearances in the arcades of Sega's hugely successful Yakuza games. Is this the mark of a grand return for Virtua Fighter? The trailer - exclusively hosted on IGN - suggests perhaps not, declaring that the ultimate 3D fighter is back for the final round, with this remaster coinciding with Sega's ongoing 60th anniversary celebrations. Still, there remains hope and it's a delight to see the series back in any form.

Yes, the Epic Games v Apple antitrust trial has now concluded, and after three weeks of remarkable discussions the decision over who won rests with a federal judge.
The trial wrapped up yesterday with some closing remarks from both parties, with Epic reiterating that the case would have an impact on the wider mobile games market and other developers (via GamesIndustry.biz). 
"Epic acknowledges that this is an important case, that there's an important set of conduct, and that a remedy... of the sort that Epic has requested would be important and significant," said Epic's counsel Gary Bornstein. "But that is because the issue affects such a large number of consumers, such a large number of developers, and has persisted for such a long period of time."

This made sorting which eggs to hatch much easier, as it was now clear which were from specific events, and it was also a welcome first step to indicating the likelihood of getting a specific creature, something fans have been loudly calling out for over the past few years.
Now, with weeks of data to test, a group of more than 50 hardcore players at top fan community The Silph Road has analysed thousands of egg hatches to see how well the tier system matches up to reality - and there are some surprising findings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A movie version of Portal is back on track, Star Trek and Lost director J.J. Abrams has said, nearly a decade after we first heard of its existence.
The project still sounds far-off, and there's no word on what has been holding up development - but the wheels now seem to be turning.
"We actually do have a script that's being written for the Portal movie now at [Warner Bros.]," Abrams said today (thanks, IGN) "We're really excited about the take and the pitch, so it feels like that thing's finally on the rails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mini Motorways, the acclaimed road-building strategy sim from developer Dinosaur Polo Club, is coming to PC and Mac via Steam on 20th July, with a Switch release to follow early next year.
If you weren't already aware, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club's equally excellent underground railway builder Mini Metro, and, despite its shift in focus, takes a similarly minimalist approach to its tactile strategy action.
This time around, your goal is to construct an efficient road network - traffic lights, bridges, motorways, and all - to ensure commuters can travel from their home to their (same-coloured) destination before the timer runs out. New building items are awarded each in-game week so your ceaseless march of urban expansion may continue, and just like in Mini Metro, things can quickly become as fraught as they are soothingly low-key.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Truck Simulator now has official - albeit experimental - multiplayer support, courtesy of developer SCS Software's latest open beta build, meaning digital truckers need truck the lonely trucking life no more.
Official multiplayer support, which SCS is calling Convoy for self-explanatory reasons, is available now as part of American Truck Simulator's experimental beta update 1.41, and will be making its way to Euro Truck Simulator 2 at a later date.
Once installed, this initial work-in-progress version of Convoy will enable players to set-up and host their own private multiplayer session for up to eight trucking pals. Everyone in a session will see synchronised time, weather, and AI traffic - as well as their trucking buddies' paint jobs and truck accessories - and can undertake the same contracts from the same companies, all heading to the same destination. In-game communication options, if you need them, include CB radio broadcast, quick replies, and text chat.

Samorost, which originally released in 2003, serves up an engaging, if brisk, blend of point-and-click puzzling and toy-like tinkering as players follow the delightfully surreal interplanetary adventures of an adorable space gnome.
Samorost has been free to play via web browser for quite some time, but it's now available as a free downloadable game on iOS and Android, as well as on PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io - meaning all three currently released Samorost titles (the latter two being more substantial paid offerings) are now accessible on the aforementioned storefronts for your amusement.

The post, published to Ubisoft's blog, comes in the wake of a French report in Le Télégramme this month that claimed the company had made only minimal changes. Ubisoft rebutted some of that report at the time, while today's statement from the very top of the company doubles down further.
"Last June, we faced the fact that not all team members were experiencing the safe and inclusive workplace that we had always intended Ubisoft to be," Guillemot writes. "Since then, we have engaged in a company-wide effort to listen, learn and build a roadmap for a better Ubisoft for all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix is reportedly collaborating with Nioh developer Team Ninja on an action-focussed Final Fantasy spin-off for PS5 and PC titled Final Fantasy Origins.
Word on the project initially began circulating over the weekend on Reddit and Resetera, and well-connected journalist and former Kinda Funny co-host Imran Khan has now lent further credence to the rumours, citing sources able to corroborate the news in a story on Fanbyte.
Final Fantasy Origins is said to take place "somewhere in or adjacent to the world of the first Final Fantasy game on the NES" and will slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja's own Nioh games and From Software's Souls series - albeit with a more accessible focus to appeal to a wider audience, according to Khan's sources.

The myth is that Street Fighter 2: World Warrior, which launched in 1991, contains a 10-0 matchup between Zangief and E. Honda.
The 10-0 matchup phrase is used by some within the fighting game community to describe a fight between two specific characters where one is so dominant that it always wins in a best of 10 match - no matter what the opponent with the weaker character tries to do.

It was a concerted attack on another core element of US democracy ­&#8211; the ability of citizens to express their voice to their political representatives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Call of Duty: Warzone developer has suggested they will tone down the sun lens flare in Verdansk '84 - the game's main map.
Some players have complained about the sun glare being so intense in Verdansk '84 that it causes visibility issues. It's particularly problematic when looking outside of a building from the inside, in certain sections of the map.
Responding to an article on Dexerto, Raven Software's lead VFX artist Reed Shingledecker tweeted to say: "I can easily tone it down if needed."

In a recent Reddit AMA, players pointed out that the cost of premium skins can cost around 1800 Apex Coins - which is the equivalent to $18 (£13) give or take.
"I get that you gotta make the game profitable, but there's gotta be a way to prevent the player from feeling cheated when they buy something," pointed out Redditor x5hadau.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A French retailer has seemingly leaked an "EU version" of Sonic Collection for PlayStation 4.
It's the same company that may have outed that Sonic Colors remaster a few weeks back, too.
French site Sogamely boasts no cover art or release date, and right now only lists the game as coming to PS4 "soon". While that can only put this firmly in the take-with-a-giant-bucket-of-salt category, we do know that Sega is currently busy celebrating 30 years of Sonic, so a game collection is certainly a possibility (thanks, VGC). We've reached out to Sega for comment, though, and will update as/when we hear back.

The new content, Odyssey, released on 19th May, is allegedly causing all kinds of problems, with reports of crashes, poor performance, bugged missions, and poor optimisation according to recent reviews left on the game's Steam page.
The feedback now aggregates over 3000 reviews, 2.2K of which are deemed "mostly negative", despite a second hotfix that rolled out on Friday in a bid to address the game's stability (thanks, NME).

The new tags - which were drawn up in consultation with "independent, third-party organisations" and "other experts focused on the progress of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, LGBTQIA+, disabled, and marginalized communities" - are "related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, mental health, and more".
