The build reportedly contains unreleased content from the lacklustre zombie shooter as well as content that made the final release back in 2018.
There is no way to purchase a legal copy of the game anymore as, just a year on from its 2018 release, Skybound revoked Starbreeze's The Walking Dead license and the beleaguered game was unceremoniously pulled from sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With reports increasingly pointing to a Switch 2 launch next year, Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has talked a little about the company's perspective on entering a new console generation, saying he believes its Nintendo Account system will help 'ease the transition'.


While Bowser, unsurprisingly, refused to comment on reports of a Switch successor specifically, he highlighted to Inverse (in the same interview where he discussed unionisation at Nintendo) the work the company has done on its single sign-in Nintendo Accounts. 


"One thing we've done with the Switch to help with that communication and transition [to a new console generation]", Bowser explained, "is the formation of the Nintendo Account. In the past, every device we transitioned to had a whole new account system. Creating the Nintendo Account will allow us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salt and Sacrifice, the follow-up to Ska Studios' enormously enjoyable 2D Soulslike Salt and Sanctuary, is making the jump to Switch and Steam (following a period of Epic Games Store exclusivity) on 7th November.


Salt and Sacrifice serves up another gloomy slab of side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat, albeit one that builds on its 2016 predecessor with a variety of new features, as players - in the role of a Marked Inquisitor - make their way across the world of Alterstone Kingdom, and its abandoned villages, dungeons, tomb-temples, and other landmarks.


Those new features include a refreshed choice of classes - Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage - plus Mage hunts, which play out as multi-part pursuits that culminate in a fearsome boss battle. There's also enhanced PvP - with new moves and different objectives depending on your chosen sect - and, for those with a more collaborative streak, two-player online and off-line co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia, the acclaimed - and previously Epic Games Store-exclusive - survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is coming to Steam on 8th November.


While Santa Ragione (which also published Lorenzo Redaelli's stellar post-COVID horror Mediterranea Inferno earlier this year) hasn't quite managed to get Saturnalia onto Steam in time for Halloween, it remains a spookily good time - whisking players away to the ancient village of Gravoi for an Sardinian folklore-inspired adventure that Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin called a "horrible nightmare in all the right ways" in his Recommended review.


The aim of Saturnalia is to solve the mystery of Gravoi and escape its confines, exploring and avoiding its horrors along the way. To that end, players can switch between four different characters at will as they try to win their freedom, but if everyone dies, the town reconfigures its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

Bowser shared his thoughts in an interview with Inverse, saying, "You only have to look at our retention numbers, which are very, very high within the industry, and our obviously low turnover rate as a result. Our focus has always been on creating a culture that's inclusive, has a work-life balance, and is focused on our singular mission of bringing smiles to faces."


Bowser added he believes Nintendo is "on the right path" when it comes to creating a "work environment and culture that allows people to be productive, to have balance in their lives, and to grow within the company".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss what's next for Microsoft and Activision Blizzard now they have finally tied the knot.
This week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer sounded a note of caution over how quickly we'd see the fruits of Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition for ourselves. There will be no immediate drop of Activision classics on Xbox Game Pass, and no sudden insertion of Master Chief in Call of Duty. 
Long-term, though, Spencer is keen to hear from Activision's teams about what they want to make - whether that's a return to Guitar Hero, Skylanders or Tony Hawk games, or something else entirely. We also ponder Microsoft's plans for a mobile game presence, driven by Candy Crush maker King. Could Gears of War turn up on mobile? What about Viva Piñata? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

This brisk performance was achieved by Mae, a known speedrunner in the Baldur's Gate 3 community. Mae previously managed to complete a Sex Any% speedrun in just under eight minutes, and has been whittling that time down ever since. 


"After just over two months, the Baldur's Gate 3 speedrunning community has finally peaked. The two minute barrier has been shattered," Mae celebrated on their YouTube channel earlier today. "We can now bang Lae'zel in under two minutes, even faster than a speedrunner can last in real life. This is the world's first sub-two minute run and the new world record."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 released today, with a storyline that developer Insomniac has said will take, on average, about 15 hours to complete if you just stick to the main story missions. If players decide to delve deeper, and complete side missions and collectables, that gameplay time could be extended to around 40 hours. 


When it first came to light that Spider-Man 2's main story could be wrapped up in a relatively short amount of time - especially when compared to the likes of this year's Baldur's Gate 3, which can take players literal days to complete - some felt that Insomniac was asking too high a price for its sequel. Here in the UK, Spider-Man 2 is £69.99 for the standard PS5 edition. If players want to upgrade to the digital deluxe version, it will set them back £79.99. 


Many have argued that game length should influence the retail price of a product, and therefore Spider-Man 2 should be priced lower than what is essentially £70. Insomniac's creative director Bryan Intihar has weighed in on this, and said that Spider-Man 2 is absolutely "worth it".

The "calf dribble", as it's been dubbed by some in the FIFA community, allows dribblers with the Trickster Playstyle to attach the ball to their calf and then simply run into the opposition's net to score.
As funny as it is to watch, that's definitely not how it's meant to work, in video game or real-life football.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Friday, and I have found another fun thing to share with you all, this time in Halo Infinite's Forge mode.

Halo Infinite's Forge mode has long been used as a canvas for many video game related homages. We have seen the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's iconic Kokiri Forest pop up here, as well as PT's terrifying corridor and Call of Duty's famous Shipment map. Blood Gulch is even in there (although, actually that one wasn't really a surprise, but all the same very cool)


The possibilities this mode can invoke are seemingly endless, and the recent update that came with Season 5: Reckoning has made this even more apparent. You see, developer 343 added the ability to include Campaign AI. This is thanks to the addition of Forge's AI Toolkit and its accompanying suite of features, which means Halo Infinite players can now spawn Grunts and such into their creations.

The trailer shows our two webbed heroes recalling past battles against the likes of Dr Otto Octavius. They also reflect on their lost loved ones, like Aunt May and Miles' dad, Jefferson "Jeff" Davis. It's touching stuff.

It's called the Chilling Update (because of all the snow, yes?) and it's available now.


The Chilling Update - also known as v1.7.0 - introduces a new playable character, a new bonus stage, a new evolving weapon, two new relics, six new EXTRA achievements, and a new music track. If that's enough information to get you salivating and you'd rather avoid spoiling the fun before diving in, stop reading now - otherwise it's time to go through all the above in more detail, starting with the new stage, Whiteout.


Whiteout is described a "20-minute bonus stage" in Poncle's patch notes, and it's unlocked by picking up a total of 20 Orologions. Once inside, players will encounter snowmen insistent on blocking their path, and face enemies which, according to Poncle, move very slowly and are particularly susceptible to fire. "So for most of it," the studio explains, "there isn't anything particularly challenging" - although you might want to save your spicy sausage for the boss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Apex Legends season - season 19, to be more specific - is almost upon, meaning the start of another drip-feed hype cycle, which has now begun in earnest with the official reveal of the free-to-play battle royale shooter's newest playable hero, Conduit.


As is the way with these things, Conduit - described by developer Respawn as a "tiny titan of optimism" - gets her introduction by way of a new Stories from the Outlands lore trailer. And, yes, there's more Titanfall fan-baiting to try and distract everyone from the fact we still haven't got a Titanfall 3, despite persistent teasing from the studio.


Once upon time, you see, Conduit's life was saved by a Monarch Titan during a violent battle that threatened to destroy her hometown - the machine's pilot choosing to sacrifice themselves in a massive detonation that would ultimately bring fighting to an explosive end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been three years since Ubisoft announced it was working on a VR instalment of Assassin's Creed, and with the game - now officially titled Assassin's Creed Nexus VR - nearing its release, the company has shared an extensive eight-minute gameplay breakdown to get players in the mood ahead of its November launch on Meta Quest 2, 3, and Pro.


Assassin's Creed Nexus VR (which Ubisoft describes as an "all-new full-length Assassin's Creed action-adventure game") casts players as an elite hacker working undercover at Abstergo on behalf of the Brotherhood. From here, they'll be able to shove their eyes into the heads of three returning series protagonists - Ezio Auditore, Connor, and Kassandra - in an attempt to locate a number of mysterious artefacts they encountered during their lives.


It's a quest that, in classic series fashion, will see players scrambling, sneaking, stabbing, and clobbering their way around some big open maps, this time spanning Renaissance Italy, Colonial America, and Ancient Greece - including Venice, Boston, and even some new locations such as Newport (presumably the Rhode Island one and not the one in Wales).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 mightn't be out yet, but if your excitement is so vast you're already pondering a second play-through, you'll be pleased to know the game will - like its predecessor - be getting a New Game Plus mode, but it'll be arriving sometime after launch.


That's according to Insomniac's director of community and marketing, James Stevenson, who shared the news in answer to a fan query on social media. "We' re working on an update for those features," he explained, adding, "but they won't be in Day 1."


Insomniac's original Marvel's Spider-Man launched in September 2018 and received a New Game Plus mode just one month later - and it appears the studio is aiming to add the feature to Spider-Man 2 in a similarly brisk fashion, with Stevenson later explaining Insomniac is hoping to get New Game Plus out to players "before end of year."

The Evil Within 2 is the sequel to Shinji Mikami's 2014 return to survival horror, and Edwin found it entertainin but lacking with its spooks, in his Evil Within 2 review back in 2017. The game follows police detective Sebastian Castellanos as he attempts to rescue his daughter from a virtual town which is overrun with mutated people. 
If you want to play The Evil Within before dipping into the sequel, it's currently one of the freebies on offer at the Epic Games Store, alongside Eternal Threads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has released a big budget live-action Xbox Series X/S advert, timed for the holiday season, which showcases several high-profile console exclusives. 


The advert begins with a young woman making her way home from what is presumably a long day at work. As Nintendo did earlier in the year when it released its live-action Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, Microsoft seems to be highlighting the welcome relief games can provide, away from the everyday, rain-soaked mundane. 


This young lady in question is soon swept out of her apartment block's lift and transported into a world of wonder and excitement. Starfield's Vasco holds her bag as a spaceship blasts off. Her world turns upside down again, as the wandering whispers of Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 surround her. She leaves, to suddenly find her corridor turned into a Forza racetrack, and then find a random Cyberpunk 2077 chap in her flat chopping up pineapples with furious force. You get the idea.

Sony announced its PS5 Slim last week, which will launch in November in the US before being rolled out to other countries. Once inventory of the existing model has sold out, the new Slim model will be the only one available.



Billbil-kun of Dealabs has noted several Japanese merchants have opened pre-orders, with a release date of 10th November, suggesting this might be when it's available in the US too.

For those unfamiliar, this is generally how new FM games roll out each year, with a period of up to a month before the official release date - in FM24's case, 6th November - being marked out as a kind of final public test, which you can gain access to by pre-ordering the game with a small discount.
It's the same again here, albeit with just two-and-a-half weeks until it's out this time, and with the shift to calling it Early Access from now on, as Sports Interactive gaffer Miles Jacobson is keen to emphasise.

Reddick stars as Hellboy in Web of Wyrd, a roguelike action brawler. It promises an original story, which the studio has curated in partnership with Dark Horse Comics as well as Hellboy's own creator Mike Mignola, although one which doesn't interfere with what Mignola himself is up to. 


"When an agent of the BPRD goes missing, Hellboy is sent to investigate; pulling him into the depths of the Wyrd," the game's description reads. You can see how it looks, and hear the late, great Lance Reddick, in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, Marvel's Spider-Man 2's fast-travel hold-to-confirm prompt is not hiding a load point. It could have been even faster, but developer Insomniac made the decision to value player usability over speed and scoring points on the internet.


Spider-Man 2's fast-travel capabilities have been widely shared across social media, and are so slick that some players have said they believe the requirement to hold down a button and confirm your fast-travelling before shooting off across the game's map was all designed as a bit of trickery to hide background loading. 


Well, that's not the case. This theory has now been squashed by Insomniac's own director of core technologies Mike Fitzgerald. As part of a ResetEra thread discussing Spider-Man 2's review scores, Fitzgerald said Insomniac discussed removing the hold-to-confirm prompt in a bid to "address that accusation", before it ultimately decided this wasn't the best idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has filed a patent for a PS5 controller which stores and charges wireless earbuds.
The earbuds would be stored in a pair of slots located inside the controller. As well as charging them, the controller would also pair the earbuds to a console.
The patent (spotted by GameRant) contains different variations of where the earbuds could be slotted into the controller. Most of the designs propose the earbuds are stored behind the touchpad, though one option places an earbud in each of the controller's grips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen has received new Steam updates to address performance issues and balance changes.

Patch 1.1.203 was released yesterday which fixed a number of stability issues to prevent crashes. In addition, subtantial performance improvements have been implemented to free up VRAM and "provide additional headroom for GPUs that are operating at the limit of their capabilities".



Thankfully some balance changes have also been made. For instance, the price of seeds has now been reduced - these are used to create temporary checkpoints throughout the world but were an expensive and limited resource.

<blockquote><p>Prosecutors charged Sullivan, whom Uber hired as CISO after the 2014 breach, of withholding information about the 2016 incident from the FTC even as its investigators were scrutinizing the company&#8217;s data security and privacy practices. The government argued that Sullivan should have informed the FTC of the 2016 incident, but instead went out of his way to conceal it from them.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also accused Sullivan of attempting to conceal the breach itself by paying $100,000 to buy the silence of the two hackers behind the compromise. Sullivan had characterized the payment as a bug bounty similar to ones that other companies routinely make to researchers who report vulnerabilities and other security issues to them. His lawyers pointed out that Sullivan had made the payment with the full knowledge and blessing of Travis Kalanick, Uber&#8217;s CEO at the time, and other members of the ride-sharing giant&#8217;s legal team...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

As shared by Videogamelayoffs (via VGC), an unnamed source from the studio revealed 32 members of staff from the Hungary-based developer had lost their jobs earlier this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has outlined some of the new Xbox accessibility features due in the coming months, including the ability to remap keyboard keys to the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2.


As detailed over on Xbox Wire, players will soon be able to remap almost 90 keyboard keys - or combinations of keys - to any button on the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2, meaning users with limited mobility can, for instance, use the Xbox Adaptive Controller with games that would ordinarily only support mouse/keyboard.


The feature - which will be available through the Xbox Accessories app on PC and console - is currently being tested by Xbox Insiders and Xbox Accessibility Insiders League (XAIL) members, but is due to launch for all players at some point "in the coming months".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt has officially brought the development of its Witcher card game spin-off Gwent to a close with one last update, putting all future balance changes in the hands of the community.


Gwent, of course, started life as a turn-based card-collecting mini-game in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (although, technically, it existed on the page of author Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher novels before that) and was expanded into its own full-scale release in 2018.


As development has continued, Gwent has recieved new cards, content updates, and expansions - as well as a standalone single-player story campaign in 2020's Thronebreaker and a rogue-like solo deck-builder in 2022's Gwent: Rogue Mage - but last December brought the news CD Projekt would wind down development after three new expansions in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox has confirmed Cities: Skylines 2 won't be getting official mod support until sometime after next week's release, with the feature set to arrive alongside its first wave of modding tools.


Official mod support was one of the original Cities: Skylines' most exciting features when it launched back in 2015, and the city builder quickly developed a vibrant modding scene that played a significant role in its early success. More than 333,000 mods are now available for the first Cities: Skylines via Steam Workshop, and Paradox has even tapped modders to create official DLC for the game over the years.


As for Cities: Skylines' imminent sequel, Paradox broke the news that mods would not be officially supported at launch in a developer diary shared on its website. And while it hasn't yet offered an estimated time of arrival for the feature, it's now published a second mod-focused developer update explaining official mod tools and mod support will arrive simulataneously post-release, once Cities: Skylines 2's all-in-one Editor leaves beta testing.

Mega Crit was one of many developers to criticise Unity's decision to begin charging studios fees based on the number times their game was installed by a user (Unity has since walked back on some of its changes, and CEO John Riccitiello departed not long after), writing, "Despite the immense amount of time and effort our team has already poured into the development on our new title, we will be migrating to a new engine unless the changes are completely reverted and [Terms of Service] protections are put in place."


Shortly after Unity's controversial announcement, Mega Crit held a three-week game jam to "explore the Godot engine due to 'recent events'". The result of those experiments is Dancing Duelists, a "deckbuilding autobattler dance off with a BUMPIN' soundtrack".

Nintendo has released the final part of its Ask the Developer interview for the game, which includes discussion of live commentary that was ultimately scrapped.


"Tezuka-san also once asked, 'Can't we have live commentary?'. I had absolutely no clue what he meant. But I interpreted it as a desire for a new experience, even if it's not necessarily in the form of live commentary," said Shiro Mouri, the game's director.

Second Extinction is a co-op, online shooter set in a futuristic world where mutated dinosaurs threaten humans. It released in early access for PC in 2020, and Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021. The game's 1.0 version was meant to release late last year, but "critical" and "show-stopping" issues caused the studio to delay it.
"Unfortunately, it became clear that our small team lacked the resources necessary to hit our quality targets," Systemic Reaction said on Steam, "and the investment needed to do so was too large for us to bear". As such, the developer has decided to cancel the game's full release.

Spencer even noted there had been "a lot of uncertainty" in the buyout process for Microsoft - right up until the deal was finally approved by the UK's regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, last week.

Phasmophobia was originally meant to release into early access on console in August, but an office fire incident in August caused developer Kinect Games to push launch back to October.

In a developer update posted to Steam, Kinect Games attributed the latest delay to August's fire incident and issues in porting the game to consoles and VR.

In an interview on the official Xbox podcast, the exec spoke more about last week's historic merger that finally saw Microsoft close the deal on its Activision Blizzard King buyout. He phil-ed us in, if you will. 


Of course, during last night's interview, the topic of Call of Duty came up. This series has often been front and centre of the ongoing trials and tribulations of recent times. In fact, at one point, Sony suggested Microsoft could deliberately release a version of the game on PlayStation platforms with degraded performance (something Microsoft said it would not do).

Coral Island, which entered early access last October on Steam and the Microsoft Store, is yet another entry in the ever-growing list of farming sims heavily inspired by Stardew Valley's more modern take on the genre (it even has an evil corporate entity of its own), but it's aiming to set itself apart with a focus on ocean exploration and conservation.


Of course, all the familiar genre staples are present and correct too, including farming, crafting, fishing, mining, decorating, socialising, and, of course, wooing, with Coral Island featuring 25 eligible islanders to romance as one season gives way to the next.

Unfortunately, not all technical issues have been resolved as yet, and Blizzard has been forced to temporarily disable cross-play between PC and consoles while it attempts to find a solution.


"We are working to resolve this," the developer explained in an update on social media, "and will provide updates as they are available."


Season of Blood arrives alongside Diablo 4's Steam release, which also saw a bit of a delay earlier today. It comes with a 25% launch week discount, ending on 24th October, meaning you can currently pick it up for £44.99 instead of the usual £59.99.

Harebrained was founded in 2011 by Mitch Gitelman and Jordan Weisman (co-creator of the BattleTech and MechWarrior universe), and was acquired by Paradox Interactive in 2018 after it published the studio's critically acclaimed BattleTech game that same year.


The Lamplighters League, which launched earlier this month, was Harebrained's first release as a Paradox studio but it arrived to middling reviews and failed to generate much commercial interest. Paradox went as far as to call its commercial performance a "big disappointment" last week, when it admitted the pulp strategy game was unlikely to recoup its development costs, resulting in a $22.7m USD write-down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're super-excited for the release of Alan Wake 2 later this month, but can't quite recall the events of the first game (entirely reasonably seeing as the original version came out over a decade ago), Fortnite of all places might have the answer. Epic has whacked a free playable 20-minute Alan Wake recap episode that should serve as a refresher while offering a bit of spooky battery gobbling fun along the way.


Alan's first adventure, released all the way back in 2010, sees the eponymous writer taking a working holiday with his wife, Alice, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls. Needless to say, it doesn't take long for things to go awry, and, soon, Alan - with occasional help from his agent BARRY - is monologuing his way through the night, blasting malevolent beings to smithereens with his torch and revealing the next big spooky event 10 seconds before it happens because he can't keep his mouth shut.


Or at least that's how I remember it. Presumably Epic's newly released Alan Wake: Flashback - a 'reimagining' of the original tale, developed in collaboration with Remedy Entertainment, Spiral House, and Zen Creative - will do a better and more reliable job of filling you in on all the important story beats ahead of Alan Wake 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exactly 364 after its announcement, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught - NetherRealm's free-to-play character-collecting RPG - is out of beta testing and available to download on iOS and Android.


Mortal Kombat: Onslaught's big selling point is its "mobile-exclusive" story - promising "high quality graphics, cinematic cutscenes, and bone-krushing kombat" - that'll see players joining forces with Raiden in a bid to prevent fallen Elder God Shinnok from gathering relics and regaining his evil powers. All that plays out through "massive real-time group battles", featuring up to ten fighters at once, that'll require players to tailor their team of four champions to take on progressively more difficult challenges.


More specifically, progress involves collecting and assembling a team from a "massive" catalogue of Assassins, Warriors, Snipers, and Defenders - including the familiar likes of Sub-Zero, Liu Kang, Scorpion, and Kitana, plus "rare, fan-favourite variants" such as Cyrax and Smoke. Each comes with its own unique Special Moves, Affinities and Passive Skills, and players will need to evolve their characters' combat skills, level their gear, and equip Relics.

The reason for that may be the state of the game at release. Full walkthroughs and cutscene footage have been shared on social media and are gaining traction for the game's poor quality.
IguanaBee is a small studio based in Chile which developed party game Headsnatchers and third person shooter G.I. Joe: Operation Blackout. GameMill Entertainment is a company which has published games for franchises through licensing deals. Its most successfully published title is Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, which a sequel is in development for.

Its subsequent sale to Songtradr was then announced last month.


In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Epic confirmed the recent Bandcamp layoffs were part of its previous wave of cuts, which were announced at the end of September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a mere few days away from release and the reviews and impressions have started rolling in across the web (no pun intended, but isn't it nice when it just happens). Many have praised the game's action, slick traversal and story, but one area that has been highlighted away from your typical professional assessment is the puddles. 

Some players felt the first Spider-Man game was lacking in the puddle density department, noting the game's E3 2017 gameplay trailer had larger and better defined puddles than in the released version. This caused quite a stir on social media and was eventually dubbed "puddlegate".

Insomniac took this all in its stride, and actually added a playful fix for Spider-Man's puddlegate in the form of puddle stickers. However, it's already clear its sequel won't need stickers to 'fix' its puddles, as they are looking pretty dense and wet from where I am sitting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video purporting to show an unused post-credits scene found within the files of Assassin's Creed Mirage may point to a seismic upcoming shift in series' story.


Filenames for the scene reference "Assassin's Creed Neo", an internal Ubisoft codename believed to refer to one of several upcoming projects currently in development. Thus, the big twist revealed here is expected to be something we see more of in future games. 


For those who'd rather be left unspoiled, this is your last chance to turn away now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Epic's announcement in August it would give third-party developers 100 percent of revenue for six months of Epic Games Store exclusivity on new games, the company - which laid off 16% of its workforce earlier this month - is now attempting to get developers on its storefront by promising 100% revenue on their back catalogue titles.


Today marks the official launch of the company's Epic First Run scheme, described as an "opt-in exclusivity program for third-party developers and publishers" that promises to boost Epic's usual 88% revenue cut for developers all the way up to 100% if they agree to keep their new game exclusive to the Epic Games Store for the first sixth months of release.


And the company is now complementing that offer by pledging to give developers - in a scheme it's calling Now On Epic - a six-month 100% revenue cut for bringing over games "currently live on another third-party PC store or included in a third-party subscription service available on another third-party PC store". Games must have been released on other storefronts before 31st October this year, and after six months of being on the Epic Games Store, revenue reverts to Epic's standard 88%/12% split.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just short of a month after Payday 3's decidedly rocky launch, which left many unable to play the always-online heist shooter, its long-awaited first patch is still nowhere to be seen; developer Starbreeze has announced a second delay for the update, most recently expected "mid-October", after it "identified some issues that need to be fixed".


Payday 3 got off to a wobbly start in September, with the game drawing criticism for its matchmaking issues, its online-only requirements (proving particularly irksome for solo players forced into lengthy queues), and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system.


Matchmaking has now been improved, and Starbreeze has pledged at least "some changes" to progression, but Payday 3's first patch is still eagerly awaited given that it promises some "200+" quality of life improvements for all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Cities: Skylines 2's release next week, publisher Paradox Interactive has admitted the city building sequel has "not achieved the [performance] benchmark we targeted". However, rather than delaying the game to remedy those issues the publisher has decided "releasing now is the best way forward".


The somewhat astonishing admission was shared in a post on the official Paradox forum, written to address "concerns raised about Cities: Skylines 2 performance" following the publisher's decision to increase Cities Skylines 2's minimum and recommended specs on PC and to delay the game on Xbox and PS5 into spring next year.


"Cities: Skylines 2 is a next-gen title, and naturally, it demands certain hardware requirements," the publisher wrote. "With that said, while our team has worked tirelessly to deliver the best experience possible, we have not achieved the benchmark we targeted."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Psychedelic horror Layers of Fear - the 2023 remake as opposed to the 2016 original - is getting a free new story chapter on 24th October to mark developer Bloober Team's 15th anniversary.


Layers of Fear (again, the new one) already featured a decent chunk of new content, of course, reconfiguring the stories of Layers of Fear 1 and 2, as well as the first game's Inheritance DLC, into a single narrative - all spruced up with striking Unreal Engine 5 visuals and new gameplay elements. And then there's a new story chapter featuring the original protagonist's wife, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer.


Bloober's newly announced Halloween/birthday treat makes yet another tortured artist - joining the Painter, Actor, Musician, and Writer from the base game - playable in Layers of Fear, this time dropping players into the director;s seat as they take the reins of a troubled Hollywood production. "Immerse yourself into the psyche of the movie's creator as you seek to complete your final masterpiece," Bloober teases, "even as the set around you descends into chaos".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix is reportedly looking to build upon its current, predominantly mobile-focused gaming offerings by introducing "higher-end" titles to its subscription catalogue - and is said to have had discussions about licensing a Grand Theft Auto game as part of the move.


The streaming company took its first tentative steps into gaming back in November 2021, with the release of five iOS and Android titles that could be downloaded and played as part of a Netflix subscription. Since then, its gaming catalogue has swelled to over 70 titles and it's made a number notable acquisitions, including Triple Town and Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox, The Walking Dead mobile developer Next Games, and Oxenfree creator Night School Studio.


Hints of more ambitious gaming plans at Netflix came with last November's announcement the company had set up a new Los Angeles studio - lead by former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny - to create a brand-new triple-A, third-person RPG for PC. And a new report from the Wall Street Journal has shed further light on Netflix plans, saying the company is "taking steps to expand into higher-end games that can be streamed from TVs or PCs."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda exec Pete Hines has announced his retirement after 24 years at the company, just weeks after Starfield's launch. 


In a statement shared on X (formerly Twitter), the now-former head of publishing said he would begin an "exciting new chapter", which will include "exploring interests and passions, donating my time where I can, and taking more time to enjoy life".


Hines said this was not a decision he came to easily, but "after an amazing career, culminating in the incredible launch of Starfield, it feels like the time is right."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After Cyberpunk 2077's much anticipated release in 2020 failed to live up to expectations, the team's morale took a "significant hit". 


That's according to Colin Walder, an engineering director at CD Projekt Red with over 15 years of experience in the games industry, who previously worked on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Rockstar titles Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto 5. Walder recently spoke to invenglobal at the Inven Game Conference in South Korea, where he discussed lessons learned from Cyberpunk 2077. 


"This approach we had, the way we were working production-wise, creating demos, and moving towards an agile mindset and workflow - it's about ensuring we're on top of certain things from the start," Walder said. "Take consoles, for example; we need to make sure they're functioning from the get-go. For our next project, Polaris [part of a new trilogy of games in CDPR's Witcher series], we're already running our demos and internal reviews on the console from the very beginning."

<blockquote><p>Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Persi Diaconis. The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started&#8212;Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51%.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Could future coin tossers use the same-side bias to their advantage? The magnitude of the observed bias can be illustrated using a betting scenario. If you bet a dollar on the outcome of a coin toss (i.e., paying 1 dollar to enter, and winning either 0 or 2 dollars depending on the outcome) and repeat the bet 1,000 times, knowing the starting position of the coin toss would earn you 19 dollars on average. This is more than the casino advantage for 6 deck blackjack against an optimal-strategy player, where the casino would make 5 dollars on a comparable bet, but less than the casino advantage for single-zero roulette, where the casino would make 27 dollars on average. These considerations lead us to suggest that when coin flips are used for high-stakes decision-making, the starting position of the coin is best concealed...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

EGX, the UK's biggest games event, ran from Thursday to Sunday last week and is run by Eurogamer's parent company Reedpop.


Protestors attempted to squirt orange paint at a screen displaying an in-progress Tekken match, before daubing more on the two players' screens. They then began a short speech, before being dragged off by security.

All of which comes as Mojang announces an absolutely monster milestone: Minecraft has now sold over 300m copies, meaning it's still the best-selling game to date, but is now well over 100m sales ahead of its nearest rival, GTA 5.


Back to Minecraft Live, though, and Mojang's celebrations began with the reveal of Minecraft's Star Wars: Path of the Jedi DLC, which comes to the in-game Marketplace on 7th November. It'll give players the chance to rise through the ranks from padawan to Jedi Knight - meaning, yes, there's lightsaber combat and Force powers - on a journey featuring familiar Star Wars characters and locations to explore.


There's more Minecraft DLC on the way in the form of a tie-in with the BBC's upcoming Planet Earth 3, promising to "immerse players in the wonders of the natural world". It'll be available via Minecraft Education and the Minecraft Marketplace when it arrives in 2024.

"The Van Gogh Museum and The Pokémon Company International take the safety and security of visitors and staff very seriously," the museum said in a statement, as spotted by our pals at VGC.

Admittedly, it's a bit of a stretch calling it a "launch trailer" given we have five days yet to wait, but nonetheless, it does a sterling job of whetting appetites ahead of the big release on 20th October. 

Captured on the PS5 and including a "mix of gameplay and in-game cinematics", the 1m13s teaser reminds us of the story so far, and what, exactly, is at stake this time around.

In a statement posted to Steam, developer Shiny Shoe said the decision came after it noted that "industry and player sentiment is trending against the presence of these features" and whilst it had always tried to be "as generous and straightforward as possible", it had resolved to remove in-game monetisation "completely" by 27th October 2023. 

Whilst the team says in-game monetisation supported the ongoing development of the game and was "100 per cent optional", content from the existing battle passes – called Levelling Passes here – will now be turned into cosmetic-only optional "supporter packs" DLCs sold on Steam.

According to True Trophies' scanners, a new platform called "PSPC" recently popped up alongside a new trophy list simply entitled "Trophy Set". Depending upon who you listen to, the "PSPC" could stand for "PlayStation PC" or "PlayStation Studios PC" – right now, we just don't know.

As spotted by PCGN, shortly after the video was posted, streamer and YouTuber Raxxanterax posted a video offering some "constructive feedback" after noting several mistakes, including inverted before/after map layouts, and a side-by-side comparison of what is described as "improved" horse speed that looks almost identical.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PC and Switch versions of Sociable Soccer 24 – the arcade football game from the creator of Sensible Soccer – will be released on 16th November, 2023.

The PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and last-gen console versions – as well as boxed physical versions – will be available in the first few months (Q1) of 2024.

The announcement accompanies news that the series has secured a licensing deal with FIFPRO – not to be confused with football associations of similar names – that developer Tower Studios says makes Sociable Soccer 24 "the only FIFPRO-licensed arcade action football game currently available on the market for PC and console" and provides the game with over 10,000 licensed players from around the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brace yourself, Mario fans – unsanctioned footage from the highly-anticipated new Super Mario Bros. adventure has leaked online days ahead of its official release date. 

According to commenters in the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, it seems as though the game is circulating illegally via ROM sites, with various comments and posts that seemingly shared links to the pirated software deleted from the thread.

"Who tf cares about spoilers in a Mario game," posited one commenter. "It's not like the story is important lol."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 is just days away from launching on Steam, and one obvious question that's arisen following the news of its storfront jump - will it work on Steam Deck? - has finally be answered by Blizzard. And it's good news, taking the form of a 'Steam Deck Verified' yes.


I'll be honest, I've not actually played Diablo 4, but its predecessor was an absolute treat to have readily, portably to hand on Switch, so I can very much see why fans of Blizzard's latest would be keen for news on its Steam Deck compatibility.


And, thankfully, Diablo's global community development director Adam Fletcher had good news to share when he broached the topic in response to fan queries on social media. "We can happily say," Fletcher wrote, "that Diablo 4 will be Steam Deck Verified starting next Tuesday with the launch of the game on Steam and the start of Season of Blood!".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a Counter-Strike 2 player with an AMD GPU, pay attention: Valve has warned that the company's latest GPU driver has introduced a new feature that, if activated, will result in a Steam VAC ban. So, basically, proceed with caution.


Here's what's going on; AMD's newly released Adrenalin Edition 23.10.1 driver adds, among other things, Anti-Lag+ support for Counter-Strike 2, which, on the face of it, seems like an entirely positive thing. After all, who wouldn't want less lag in their fiercely competitive online shooty game?


Unfortunately, the way the Anti-Lag+ feature works - it does its job by "detouring engine dll functions", according to Valve - can have serious consequences for Counter-Strike 2 players who opt to turn it on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Microsoft's $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition now officially a done deal as of today, Ubisoft has been discussing its new ownership of all Activision Blizzard streaming rights, which also kick in today - and as part of the conversation, it's talked a little about physical media, saying that while interesting might decline as streaming rises, it doesn't think it's "going away".


Ubisoft secured the streaming rights to all Activision Blizzard games (for the next 15 years, and outside the EU, at least) as part of revisions made by Microsoft to get its proposed acquisition across the finish line after UK regulators blocked the deal highlighting concerns around its potential impact on the emerging cloud gaming market.


With the deal now approved and Microsoft officially the owner of Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft's role as streaming rights licensor of Activision's games has come into effect too. The Assassin's Creed publisher has shared a Q&A to mark the occasion, discussing its view on the future of game streaming and clarifying some aspects of its agreement with Microsoft - including reconfirmation Activision Blizzard games are coming to its own Ubisoft+ subscription service.

Molyneux revealed the game is currently codenamed MOAT, an acronym, last month.

In a statement shared with Eurogamer, the CWA said today's merger represents a "milestone" in the industry.


"Under the terms of a ground-breaking, legally-binding labour neutrality agreement, Microsoft will remain neutral when Activision Blizzard employees express interest in joining a union, providing a clear path to collective bargaining for almost 10,000 workers," the CWA said, with its president Claude Cummings Jr calling this a "new day" for Activision Blizzard employees following mass employee protests in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard's controversial boss Bobby Kotick has said he will stay on as the company's CEO for the remainder of 2023, following Microsoft's long-awaited acquisition of the company today. 


A statement from Xbox boss Phil Spencer says similar, with Kotick's tenure at the company set to continue through "the end of 2023" to "ensure a smooth and seamless integration". 


Neither notice makes it explicit what will happen next year, though the wording of both statements suggests Kotick's departure is possible as early as January 2024.

Microsoft now owns Activision, including the world's biggest first-person shooter franchise Call of Duty, alongside the rights to Spyro, Skylanders, and Guitar Hero.

Last year, Yasuda stated Lollipop Chainsaw RePop won't update the original's story or aesthetics. "We want to make it so that the game can be as close to the original version as possible," Yasuda said, echoing the only major aspect which will be changed is the game's licensed music soundtrack.

This "Really Useful Starfield" mod was created and uploaded by the aptly named Trainwiz, who has kindly provided us with a rather sinister backstory explaining Thomas' arrival in space.


"For his crimes against God and his invention of murder, Thomas was smote, thusly. Rejected from Hell and obviously never going to get into Heaven, they say that the Tank Engine has been banished to wander the stars forever, unable to satiate his bloodlust and unable to find peace in his heart," Trainwiz begins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been looking to stock up on the spooks and scares in anticipation of this year's impending Halloween, the Epic Games Store has your back; next week's freebie over there is The Evil Within, the acclaimed horror from Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami. And it's joined by the Eurogamer recommended Eternal Threads.


The Evil Within - which was created by Ghostwire: Tokyo and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, the studio Mikami departed earlier this year - released all the way back in 2014, dragging players, in the role of rugged police detective Sebastian Castellanos, along on a positively bonkers ride through the shape-shifting likes of a dilapidated asylum, a fading mansion, a mannequin factory, and more.


It's a return to the kind of nail-bitingly tense third-person survival horror Mikami's Resident Evil games - particularly the revolutionary Resident Evil 4 - were known for, and it all plays out like an enthusiastic love letter to the horror genre as a whole, packing in everything from sadistic chainsaw-wielding cannibals to J-horror-style hair ghosts. It's great, despite a few rough edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a dramatic day for internet-sleuthing Mario fans; with Nintendo still tightlipped on who'll take over the role of the iconic plumber following Charles Martinet's acension to "Mario Ambassador", a fresh leak appeared to have finally revealed video gaming's current biggest secret. However, the actor in question - one Mick Wingert - has now thrown a bit of a spanner in the works by declaring that, no, it's not actually him.


To rewind a bit, all this started when (thanks VGC) an anonymous 4chan forum user shared images and details said to be from a US kiosk demo for Switch's soon-to-be-released Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Some of those images revealed previously unseen areas of the game, suggesting the leak was, in fact, legit - suddenly making an accompanying 20-strong unverified list of Mario Wonder voice actors a lot more interesting.


Now relatively sure of the list's veracity, internet sleuths began combing through the names - unhelpfully provided with no hint of the roles they're playing in-game - trying to figure out if one them might just be the new voice of Mario. To cut a long story short, after removing returning Mario series voice actors, indentifiable foreign language actors, and female actors, only two names remained: Kevin Afghani and Mick Wingert.

Alien: Blackout follows Amanda Ripley (daughter of Ellen Ripley) as she attempts to guide four survivors to safety aboard the Xenomorph-infested Mendel Station, viewing their progress through security cameras and via an overhead station map.


It's officially "not related" to Creative Assembly's superb 2014 first-person horror Alien: Isolation, despite being set just a few days after the game and sharing a protagonist - although that bit of information wasn't revealed until Blackout's announcement began to draw ire from fans angry at what appeared to be a sequel releasing exclusively for mobile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has shared more details on EA Sports FC Tactical, its previously announced free-to-play turn-based football spin-off, confirming it'll launch for iOS and Android "early 2024".


EA Sports FC Tactical was first mentioned during EA's grand unveiling for its new-look football series back in July. At the time, information on the game was limited, but the publisher has now shared a little more as pre-registration opens via the iOS App Store and Google Play.


EA says Tactical is all about "in-game strategies, such as stamina and power-play management", and it reimagines EA Sports FC's usual match action as a turn-based experience, with opponents taking it in turns to defend, attack, perform skill moves, and attempt to score goals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has unveiled a new Xbox Series S Starter Bundle, which'll include three months of Game Pass Ultimate when it launches worldwide on 31st October.


All in all, it's a pretty straightforward offering, packing in the Xbox Series S (which comes with 512GB storage as standard), a wireless controller, an HDMI cable, and the aforementioned three months of Game Pass Ultimate - all for £249.99.


It's the latter that sets the Starter Bundle apart from Microsoft's usual £250 Xbox Series S offering, of course, meaning you're basically getting that three months of Game Pass Ultimate - which would ordinarily cost around £40 - as a freebie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Sony's newly-announced PlayStation 5 "Slim", which is set to launch in the US next month. 
Repeatedly leaked, the PS5 Slim's existence was not too much of a surprise, though word that its digital version would cost more in the US and that you now need to splash out £25 to stand the console upright still managed to raise some eyebrows. 
Rather than a proper mid-gen refresh, the Slim is more of a redesign - with no real incentive for existing PS5 owners to upgrade. Still, is a good resdesign? Does it position the console's digital edition as the PS5's main version? And most importantly, is standing your console vertical better? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

The CBT (rest in piece CNT) will take place next weekend from 20th to 23rd October. Those with access will be able to try out head-to-head competitive play with cross-platform matching, and the Tekken Fight Lounge, described as an "immersive lobby" where players can interact and explore different features and game modes. 
Footage from the beta can easily be found on social media sites, as well as bewilderment from fans. Bandai Namco rolled out a pre-load update for the beta on Steam and Xbox on 10th, giving those with the know-how the opportunity to crack the PC files.

These attacks, which were verified by PC Gamer, only affected less than 100 Steam users, although NanoWar: Cells VS Virus (pictured above) developer Benoît Freslon recently revealed the hackers had taken control of his browser access tokens. This essentially gave the hackers access to any service Freslon had been logged into. 
"I just used my dev account to release the game few hours before the hack I suppose," he shared on X (formerly Twitter).

You take on the role of a single dad who's a school caretaker (or janitor, seeing as the game takes place in the US) by day, and a mob cleanup crew by night. The mob pays much better than the regular day job, and we need the money to pay for our sick daughter's healthcare. Ah, the good old American healthcare system.

Ever wonder how software gets deployed onto a system that is deliberately disconnected from the Internet and other networks? These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature. Sensitive as in utilities (power/water), banking, healthcare, weapons systems, other government use cases, etc. Sometimes it's technically a water gap, if you're running Kubernetes on an underwater vessel. Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.
Again, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments. Traditionally, software artifacts are physically carried across the air gap on hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, or flo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's looking increasingly likely Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard will have cleared its final hurdle if - as is widely expected - UK regulators approve the revised deal later this week; it's being reported EU regulators won't require an investigation into the revised terms, clearing the way for the acquisition to conclude.


The European Commission approved Microsoft's original acquisition proposal back in May after successfully securing a number of concessions to lessen the deal's potential impact on the emerging cloud gaming market. However, Microsoft was forced to submit a revised proposal after the deal was blocked by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority.


These revised terms - which will give Ubisoft exclusive control of streaming rights for Activision's titles outside of the EU - were provisionally approved by the CMA in September, and the regulator is expected to formally approve the deal this Friday, 13th October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery - which bundles together all three entries in developer Worm Club's endearingly silly sleuthing series - will be launching for PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox (including Game Pass) on 27th October.


Fire up Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery, and you'll be able to play The Haunted Island - the 2018 adventure that started it all, wherein our sleuthing lead travels to exotic climes to solve the mystery of a sloth-bothering ghost - alongside its fairly self-explanatory 2019 sequel, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, and Frog Detective's final case, the wild-west-themed Corruption at Cowboy County, which released earlier this year.


These are not particularly lengthy games, each lasting an hour or two (Worm Club's official estimate for the whole Entire Mystery is "the four best hours of your life"), but Frog Detective's warm, silly demeanour still makes for a wonderfully entertaining time. And there's even a scooter in part three so, really, what's not to like?

Last week, YouTuber Volound issued a well-sourced report on Hyenas' downfall, including the detail that it had been Sega's "biggest budget game ever". That report stated Hyenas had been plagued with a lack of direction before it was ultimately canned.
Now, a further video by Volound has shared further quotes on Hyenas from anonymous sources who worked on its development. "I'm paralysed with a mixture of upset and anger over what's happening to my friends there," one person said.

Cloud streaming has been included with PlayStation Plus Premium membership since Sony's revised subscription service launched last year. However, it was previously restricted to streaming PS4 Game Catalogue titles and PS3 and PS2 games from the Classics Catalogue.


Starting this month, though, Premium subscribers can play PlayStation 5 Game Catalogue titles, PlayStation 5 Game Trials, and digital PlayStation 5 titles they've purchased (including associated DLC and in-game purchases) via cloud streaming on their PS5.

The publisher of Worms, Dredge and Hell Let Loose confirmed it was planning to make redundancies earlier this month, after Eurogamer broke news that extensive cuts were being made to Team17's QA department in favour of outsourcing work elsewhere.


But the job losses go much further than those at risk in QA, Eurogamer understands, with staff across a wide range of departments affected - including those employed in Team17's marketing, usability, customer service, IT and HR teams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has called its recent The Lamplighters League a "big disappointment" from a commercial perspective, admitting - just seven days after its release - the pulp strategy game is unlikely to recoup its development costs, resulting in a $22.7m USD write-down.


The Lamplighters League, which was developed by the Paradox-owned Harebrained Schemes, blends tactical turn-based action and real-time stealth in a globe-trotting adventure inspired by the classic pulp stories of the 1930s, giving players control of a disparate group of rogues as they attempt to thwart an occult-obsessed cabal known as the Banished Court.


In truth, it's a deeply uneven experience; at its best, it's a "sublimely atmospheric, richly rewarding tactical adventure" - as I wrote in my 3 out of 5 stars review - but it's too often let down by bland maps, uninspiring mission objectives, and woefully underdeveloped real-time stealth. And it's clearly failed to capture the public's imagination too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has shared a new promo for upcoming release Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and it is really quite charming. 


The short video in question shows Bowser trying his best to woo Princess Peach with a single flower. She looks at him with a certain amount of scepticism, before both are distracted by the bouncy arrival of one of Super Mario Bros. Wonder's elephant power-ups. And, well, when one sees the opportunity to boost one's form into that of a trunk swinging, water spraying mammal, there really is only one thing for it. 


Soon, Peach has ingested (?) the elephantine delectable and is transformed before Bowser's very eyes. He is shocked to say the least, staring at his once demure princess with an open mouth and wide eyes. But, you know what? Our spikey boy is into it. Just when it may seem that Peach - in her enlarged and now tailed form - is about to blast Bowser back to his castle with a swift burst of water, he presents her with an even bigger bunch of flowers. It is a plot twist I wasn't expecting, and it is really rather sweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lilith Moira, Diablo's demonic Queen of the Succubi, is now in Overwatch 2, but this has been even less of a heavenly debut than perhaps developer Blizzard was expecting. 


The studio made a big deal out of Lilith's arrival as part of its promos for Season 7: Rise of Darkness. This got fans excited - or it did, until it didn't.


You see, it turns out this Lilith skin is only available through an Ultimate Battle Pass bundle, and that bundle doesn't exactly come cheap - it's £35/$40.

That's according to a wave of reports from trusted leakers such as HypeX and Shiina, who rely on insider information and details gleaned from within Fortnite's files. 


Yesterday, Fortnite imagery appeared online that referenced a return to the original "Chapter 1" map, as this season's villain Kado Thorne can be seen standing in front of a time machine set to the date "2018 07 12" - that's the day the original map's fifth season launched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sony announced its "slim" models for the regular and digital editions of PlayStation 5, but not without some extra costs being introduced with the line.
For starters, both the regular and digital PS5 slim models will come with a hotizontal stand, but no base. A base is included in the box with the launch models, but if you want to stand the PS5 slim vertically, you'll need to buy a separate vertical stand (compatible with all PS5 models!) for £25, or $30. 
For buyers in North America, the slim model of the digital PS5 is more expensive than the launch model, costing $450 compared to $400, despite its smaller size. The slim PS5 with a disc drive will remain at the same price of $500.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, British eSports announced a partnership with the Saudi eSports Federation. The UK's national body for competitive video gaming said this collaboration aimed to set "new standards of excellence, education and innovation throughout the world of esports". This would include a variety of endeavours between the two parties, including internships, training programs and research projects.


However, British eSports has now acknowledged this news had sparked "concern" - no doubt fuelled by Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, which includes the criminalisation of homosexuality, fewer rights for women and the use of the death penalty. Saudi's Prince Mohammed bin Salman has also been blamed for assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by US intelligence agencies.


As a result, British eSports has released a statement addressing issues raised by the esports community.

The video, which was published by 404media following public records requests, shows the car being driven erratically as the officers race to catch a Snorlax and then a Togetic - the evolved form of Togepi.


The two cops talk excitedly about catching Pokémon while, in the background, radio calls can be heard - including a request for backup at a local shopping mall where a robbery is in progress.

That's according to Bloomberg (paywall), which stated Iger's deputies are keen for the exec "to consider a bolder transformation of Disney from gaming licensee to gaming giant". This could be done through the acquisition of a major publisher, with EA being specifically cited by the publication.


But while Iger's advisors are suggesting that Disney do purchase a company such as EA, at the present time Iger is reportedly remaining "non committal" to the idea. So, do not expect to hear any big announcements in the near future.

The internal event, held days before Microsoft is expected to finally close its $68.7bn takeover of the company, was not available to view publicly, but Windows Central has  reported on what was discussed.


Kotick reportedly reminisced about Activision's journey as a company so far and also dropped several hints about its future - including an intriguing mention of the long-dormant Guitar Hero franchise.

Previously, Critical Strike Damage and Vulnerable Damage were calculated separately, meaning players could use skills with these attributes to pile on huge amounts of damage. 


Now, Critical Strike Damage will be capped at 50 percent and Vulnerable Damage at 20 percent as part of a "baseline multiplicative bonus" - bonus damage will be added together and multiplied by these percentages for each.

Mojang has now revealed all three mobs that'll be put to the vote ahead of a grand results unveiling during this weekend's Minecraft Live - the crab, the penguin, and the armadillo - and it's a selection a newly launched fan petition describes as "three equally great options".


The petition, which at the time of writing has received 295K signatures from Minecraft fans in the three days since its launch, argues, "Mojang somehow releases less content WITH Microsoft's backing than they did without, [meaning] players see minimal content to the game they love". It continues that by "leaving fantastic ideas on the cutting room floor, and teasing content that will never be seen in the game", players must "watch as possibly the one thing to get them to play again is ripped from them".

Trading was introduced to Rocket League in 2016, giving players the opportunity to exchange certain earned items, including cosmetics dropped at the end of matches and revealed blueprints (but not premium DLC), with other players and third-party trading sites.


From 4pm PST on 5th December this year, however, player-to-player trading will be removed from the game. Explaining the change in a post to its website, Psyonix - which was acquired by Epic Games in 2019 - insisted this would align Rocket League with Epic's "overall approach to game cosmetics and item shop policies, where items aren't tradable, transferrable, or sellable."

Terminator: Resistance originally released back in 2019, whisking players away to a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles - some 31 years after the events of Terminator: Judgment Day - for some first-person shooting action as they, in the role of resistance fighter Jacob Rivers, helped mount an assault against the Terminator menace.


Former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't too keen on the game when he reviewed it back in 2019, calling it "so generic that it has dissolved in my memory like a Skip on my tongue" - and that's despite Terminator: Resistance somehow managing to shoe-horn in two "inexplicably cringe" first-person sex scenes along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classic WW2 real-time stealth-tactics series Commandos is being revived for a sixth entry, Commandos: Origins, and it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.


Commandos, if you're unfamiliar, first made a splash back in 1998 with launch of developer Pyro Studios' first series entry, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines - which challenged players to guide a six-strong team of commandos, each with their own distinct abilities, behind enemy lines (the clue was very much in the title), to undertake the likes of sabotage and assassination missions while staying as sneaky as possible.


It's very good, if notoriously tough, and was followed by four more games: 1999's standalone expansion Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty, 2001's Commandos 2: Men of Courage (which introduced a 3D engine), 2003's Commandos 3: Destination Berlin, and 2006's Commandos: Strike Force - which re-imagined the series' formula in first-person.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has unveiled new "smaller" versions of its PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Digital consoles, which will launch this November in the US alongside an optional disc drive attachment for purchasers that wish to upgrade their digital-only machine at a later date.


The newly revealed console is said to mark a 30% decrease in volume compared to the previous PS5 model (and a weight reduction of 18% and 24% for the standard and digital edition respectively), and sports a design featuring two glossy panels on the top and two bottom panels that'll retain the matte look of the original machine.


The bottom left quadrant is where you'll find the new Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive attachment if you opt for the standard version of the machine. The digital-only version includes a removable panel that'll enable purchasers to add the drive - which costs an extra £99.99/€119.99/$79.99 USD - should they want a version capable of playing digital media at a later time.

Earlier today, Bandai Namco announced Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam). 
This revamped edition of the game will offer the same chaotic, chomp-tastic, 64-player shenanigans as its former Stadia exclusive days, but with the addition of new gameplay modes, music, customisation options and "enhanced visuals".

And sadly for those eager to hear more, this is seemingly not something we should expect to hear any time in the near future. Instead, Meta is remaining remarkably tight-lipped about the project it once said was "many years in the making".
At this year's Connect conference, Meta was asked for more news on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' VR release by both UploadVR and Road to VR. However, the responses were less than informative.

In summer 2020, allegations of sexual assault and harassment were made against a number of senior and veteran employees including Assassin's Creed Valhalla creative director Ashraf Ismail, Splinter Cell and Far Cry creative director Maxime Béland, and former editorial vice president Tommy François.
Speaking at GamesIndustry HR Summit last month, Ubisoft's chief people officer Annika Grant said the company is now "on the right path" following a number of changes implemented internally, as reported by GamesIndustry. Grant joined Ubisoft in 2021 when it was "navigating a misconduct crisis".

<blockquote><p>Polynomial Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Billions of dollars and countless GPU hours are currently spent on training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for a variety of tasks. Thus, it is essential to determine the difficulty of extracting all the parameters of such neural networks when given access to their black-box implementations. Many versions of this problem have been studied over the last 30 years, and the best current attack on ReLU-based deep neural networks was presented at Crypto&#8217;20 by Carlini, Jagielski, and Mironov. It resembles a differential chosen plaintext attack on a cryptosystem, which has a secret key embedded in its black-box implementation and requires a polynomial number of queries but an exponential amount of time (as a function of the number of neurons)...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

But while those inclusions expanded the map, there were some omissions as well. Most obviously, just where did all of that Sheikah tech, that was so instrumental to Breath of the Wild's story, go? And what happened to those spidery robot Guardians?


Well, according to Zelda director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, the various towers, Guardians, Divine Beasts and other Sheikah creations simply disappeared, with the general consensus in Hyrule being that as their purpose had been realised, the tech knew it was its time to go.

Jack Skellington from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is also joining Fortnite - I like that he also has his Santa Jack costume as well - alongside Halloween's Michael Myers.

The Kubernetes community recently announced
that their legacy package repositories are frozen, and now they moved to
introduced community-owned package repositories powered by the
OpenBuildService (OBS).
CRI-O has a long history of utilizing
OBS for their package builds,
but all of the packaging efforts have been done manually so far.
The CRI-O community absolutely loves Kubernetes, which means that they're
delighted to announce that:
All future CRI-O packages will be shipped as part of the officially supported
Kubernetes infrastructure hosted on pkgs.k8s.io!
There will be a deprecation phase for the existing packages, which is currently
being discussed in the CRI-O community.
The new infrastructure will only support releases of CRI-O >= v1.28.2 as well as

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With all signs pointing to an imminent successful end for Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition saga, Activision has moved to address the issue of its titles appearing on Game Pass, saying not to expect that to happen until next year if the deal goes through.


To date, Activision titles have been notably absent from Game Pass, but the assumption has been that would change if Microsoft's $69bn bid for the Call of Duty publisher succeeded. And with the deal now anticipated to be finalised this week, assuming the UK's Competition and Markets Authority gives it the green light as is generally expected, questions around an Activision presence on Game Pass have shifted from 'if' to 'when'.


And the company has now addressed fan queries on social media, writing, "As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we've been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has announced the departure of its CEO John Riccitiello, just weeks after the company became mired in controversy following hugely unpopular changes to its engine pricing model.


At the end of last month, Unity announced sweeping changes to its Unity Engine business model that would force developers to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee every time their game was installed, on top of their existing licence subscription, after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash from the development community was immediate and intense, and Unity eventually announced significant changes to its initial plans - but by that point, the damage was done.


And now Unity has announced that John Riccitiello, the CEO who oversaw its reputationally devastating pricing changes, "will retire" from all his roles at the company - president, chief executive officer, chairman, and a member of its board of directors - effective immediately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam's Next Fest has returned for another week-long showcase of future releases, including developer livestreams, chats, and, of course, "hundreds" of playable demos.


Valve's latest Steam Next Fest is already underway and runs until 5.59pm BST/9.59am PST on Monday, 16th October. That means you've got just under seven full days at the time of writing to furiously claw your way through another bumper crop of playable demos before they potentially vanish once more into the ether.


We're well beyond the days when you could feasibly work your way through the entire list before the end of Next Fest (unless you're particularly determined and hate sleep, I suppose), but Valve has, at least, assembled a special event mini-site, splitting available demos down into mere easily perusable and digestible categories.

FOV (that's field-of-view if your abbreviation list isn't up to date) can now be adjusted in both first- and third-person perspective with the arrival of Starfield's 1.7.36 update, and that comes alongside a whopping three additional bullet points in Bethesda's patch notes.


The studio is also touting improved stability for PCs using Intel Arc GPUs, and there are some - entirely mysterious - stability and performance improvements promised for all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA's long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher's keen to let everyone know it's doing just fine without it - and has announced that this year's iteration, EA Sports FC 24, has reached 11.3m players in its first week of release.


That's compared to the 10.3m players that hopped into last year's FIFA 23 during the same period - a figure EA referred to as "record-breaking" and the "biggest launch period" in the franchise's history at the time.


EA Sports FC 24's 11.3m players would certainly suggest the series' success hasn't been hampered by the loss of the FIFA brand, then, but EA does note this year's figures include EA Play subscribers, so those numbers don't necessarily all equate to sales.

It's called Assassin's Focus, and it allows you to freeze time and paint a reticule over multiple enemies to teleport between them all and murder them in quick succession. It's like Red Dead Redemption's Quickdraw mode, except you're physically knifing people in the neck with every bullet.


At the beginning of Assassin's Creed Mirage, you can only pull off this effect with two enemies at a time, but with further upgrades you're able to expand this effect to quickly end a whole group of foes at once.

Hero Pass was described by Jagex as an "always-on reward system" and it was introduced into RuneScape last month. It was heavily criticised by players for pay-to-win elements such as XP buffs, which prompted Jagex to temporarily roll back the update shortly after Hero Pass launched.
Following feedback from a player survey, Jagex announced Hero Pass will end once the current season, Underworld, finishes on 4th December.

Gollum released in a rather sorry state in May earlier this year, and was heavily criticised for a lack of polish and technical issues. A statement attributed to Daedalic Entertainment and released on its social media one day after release apologised for the game's quality and stated the studio's commitment to improving the game with patches.
The report from German outlet Game Two was created after interviewing 32 former and current employees at Daedalic, as well as receiving statements from the company itself, on the development of Gollum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A skilled Tomb Raider fan has reimagined the series' second game as a 3D side-scroller.


Created by Delca, who is also working on a Tomb Raider Legend demake, this side-scrolling adventure sees Lara making her way around the likes of Venice, the Great Wall of China and, of course, Croft Manor as she searches for the Dagger of Xian. However, this time she can only travel backwards and forwards.


It is a rather incredible recreation, and one that clearly has a lot of love attached to it. As I said in my headline, it is a brilliant tribute to a brilliant game.

Reading the headlines, one would hope that the rapid gains in AI technology have also brought forth a unifying realization of the risks&#8212;and the steps we need to take to mitigate them.</p>
<p>The reality, unfortunately, is quite different. Beneath almost all of the testimony, the manifestoes, the blog posts, and the public declarations issued about AI are battles among deeply divided factions. Some are concerned about far-future risks that sound like science fiction. Some are genuinely alarmed by the practical problems that chatbots and deepfake video generators are creating right now. Some are motivated by potential business revenue, others by national security concerns...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage might take Ubisoft's historical stabathon series back to basics, but there's a newer visual effect which players want rid of. 


The game's visual chromatic aberration effect is switched on by default and there's no way to turn it off - despite it being pronounced and sometimes quite distracting in certain areas. 


One of the first things I did when starting to play Mirage was look for some kind of slider or toggle to tune the effect (or just disable it completely). Alas, one does not exist.

One of the most missable companions is Minthara, who appears in Act 1 of the game. In normal circumstances, recruiting her means siding with the goblins and attacking Emerald Grove along with the refugee Tieflings that are staying there.
However, this comes with some significant consequences - Halsin will refuse to help you later on in the game, and Karlach will be unavailable as a companion. Unless you're Taiwanese player pao870111, who came up with a way to recruit Minthara in a morally good playthrough without the use of mods.

Even more amazingly still, the cat isn't even a work of fiction created by the dev team. It turns out that a fan shared an image of the sweet kitty after he "recently crossed the rainbow bridge" and after bringing him to the attention of the team and offering "coffee and Timbits" to any dev prepared to immortalise the cat in the game, it seems Ubisoft did precisely that.

"Am I reaching at straws here or?" asked suckashelfboi101 on the game's subreddit, seeking assurances that they weren't just seeing things. "Is this cats face supposed to look like the Assassin Emblem or what because it’s all I can see. Maybe something the devs put in for fun?"

Described as a "standalone" demo, players can get an early "bespoke" taste of the sequel's "bold new world" through a series of hand-picked puzzles spread across "stunning new locations, as well as a glimpse into the vast narrative that awaits them".

As Matt recently summarised for us, the original Talos Principle served up an often fiendishly cerebral bout of puzzle-solving with lasers, time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophy. Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle "rooms" that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress through the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we creak ever closer to spooky season and a possible second Silent Hill Transmission – the last was just before Halloween 2022 – it seems Bloober Team has quietly been updating the backend of Silent Hill 2 Remake's Steam page.

In fairness, the store description and its accompanying tags have been tweaked routinely throughout the year, but according to Steam DB, there's been a flurry of activity through September and now October, including confirmation of language subtitles (Brazillian, Portuguese, and Ukrainian), tags, and Steam achievements, hinting that the in-game achievements have been finalised and signed off. The store assets and images have also been refreshed, too.

Concrete proof that an update or release is imminent? Hardly. But it's one of the strongest signals yet that development has entered the final straight, and the "coming soon" on the game's Steam page is accurate. Here's hoping we'll get a long-overdue update from Konami in the next week or so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile has been delayed to 2024.

Confirmation came in the action-packed Call of Duty Next event earlier this week, when co-studio head Chris Plummer said the delay was down to the team wanting to "polish up" the mobile spin-off. 

This means that the original "fall (Q3) 2023" window has now been pushed back to spring (Q2) 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A reference to a "remastered" version The Last of Us Part 2 has been spotted on the profile of a Naughty Dog developer, lending further credence to suggestions an enhanced version of the 2020 PlayStation 4 game is on the way.


Hints that an expanded version of The Last of Us Part 2 is in development at Naughty Dog first surfaced back in July, when the game's composer, Gustavo Santaolalla, referenced a "new edition" that would enable players to interact with his banjo-playing cameo in the town of Jackson, selecting from a number of songs he can play.


Santaolalla wouldn't share any more details beyond that, leaving fans to ponder exactly what sort of "new version" he might be referring to, but now, thanks to a now-removed update on the LinkedIn profile of Naughty Dog's lead outsource artist Mark Pajarillo (as spotted by over on Resetera), we might finally have a clearer idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five months after release, Arkane Studios' beleaguered vampire shooter Redfall has received its long-promised 60fps mode on Xbox Series X/S, as part of a major patch that also brings improved performance on PC, stealth takedowns, increased enemy counts, and more.


A 60fps mode for Redfall was first touted back in April, after publisher Bethesda broke the news its game would be locked to 1440p and 30fps on both Xbox Series X and S at launch. At the time, the studio said a 60fps "performance mode" would be added at some point after release - although it's doubtful many were expecting it to take five moths to arrive.


Redfall's performance mode comes as part of a substantial update for Xbox Series X/S and PC touching on everything from gameplay and performance to accessibility. Patch notes promise "improved PC performance and stability across a wide range of hardware configurations", for instance, alongside fixes for memory crashes and graphical corruption on AMD GPUs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life may be full of regrets, but if one of those regrets is that you decided to call your Baldur's Gate 3 character Bumfart the Third in a moment of weakness, there's some good news: the game's latest hotfix will finally let you change their ill-conceived name.


That's the headline feature for Baldur's Gate 3's Hotfix #9 (or at least it is if you're a remorseful Bumfart), but there's more where that came from. The Magic Mirror, for instance, will - as well as enabling the aforementioned renaming unshaming - allow you to customise your hirelings if their outward appearance isn't to your liking.


Developer Larian notes the same restrictions apply to hirelings that apply when changing the appearance of the player character - presumably meaning you can give them a full aesthetic makeover to suit your dubious whims but you're stuck with their original race, sub race, and any cosmetic modifications resulting from gameplay.

Dave the Diver's previous big update, which released in August, was predominantly focused on quality of life improvements, and while there're plenty more of those stuffed into October's update, we get a bunch of new content too.


The glacier area, for instance - which primarily exists as a story-focused location with fewer missions compared to its counterparts right now - will receive new quests. Additionally, the ocean is set to welcome new species - crabs and lobsters - both requiring players to use special traps to catch. Oh, and a lobster party event will be added to coincide with their arrival.

Redfall's launch didn't go as parent company Microsoft had hoped, as Phil Spencer revealed the company had expected the game to review much higher than it did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have a release date for American Arcadia: 15th November on PC (via Steam). So, if you are anything like me and rather looking forward to this release, thankfully there is not too much longer to wait. 


If you are unsure of what American Arcadia is all about, I will give you a little overview. It is by Out of the Blue, the same studio that gave us 2020's rather special Call of the Sea, and set in the "retro-futuristic '70 metropolis" Arcadia.


On the outside, Arcadia seems to promise its residents a life of cushy luxury, but all is not what it seems. In fact, the Arcadia residents are all part of a TV show, and they have no idea they are being recorded for the entertainment of the wider public (think The Truman Show). But, it is not all as innocent as that (not that that is especially innocent, really). You see, if the viewers don't like someone, well, it could end in their death. And this is something that our poor everyday man Trevor Hills is trying to avoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you may recall, earlier this year Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4 requires players to create new characters each season. And, with season two just around the corner, we thought it would be a good idea to let you know how to ensure you don't lose your stash as well as your character. 


When Diablo 4's current season - Season of the Malignant - comes to an end, players will see their seasonal characters moved over to the Eternal Realm with all their items - but there's a time limit to recover them. 


Items will be found in your stash in a new  "Withdraw Only Stash tab". But don't get complacent, as they won't stay here forever. If you want to withdraw any of your items from this chest, you will need to make sure you do so before Diablo 4's second season comes to a close. Otherwise, they will become "unrecoverable".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft plans to finally buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn next Friday, 13th October, according to a fresh report from The Verge.


That date is still contingent on the UK's Competition and Markets Authority giving the deal an official green light - though the regulator has already signalled it is likely to do so. 


The CMA has until 18th October to weigh in with its final decision, following a deadline today for feedback on the deal's revised form - now Microsoft has agreed to sell off streaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft.

Earlier this week, the game's latest patch (6.5) was released and in its ending cutscene there's a pair of legs that appear to be from a potential new playable race.


Reddit user Drbiohazmat has datamined the legs to find out some more detail: the legs have hair all over, a unique running and jumping animation, and a hole where a tail should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 has had a rather rocky start, with server issues plaguing its launch leaving many unable to play the always-online heist shooter. Now, another rock has made its way onto that already bumpy road, with developer Starbreeze announcing it has chosen to delay its upcoming patch. 


This patch was initially meant to be released yesterday, 5th October, and address "200+ QoL-improvements for all platforms". However, the developer has pushed it back until an unspecified time in mid-October. This, the Payday 3 team has said, is to "ensure its stability".


"The patch needs some changes that would require us to go through console certification again," Starbreeze explained. In a follow up post, the team confirmed that this will mean the game's "PS5 bonus content will remain unredeemable until this patch is ready".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the topic of video game industry layoffs, something that seems to be rarely out of the headlines over the past few weeks and months. 
Layoffs are nothing new, of course, but this year in particular feels like a particularly tough time, at companies big and small. From tech giants such as Microsoft and Epic Games down to development studios such as Telltale Games, the bad news just keeps on coming. 
We discussed the job losses at Creative Assembly last week following the cancellation of Hyenas. Since then, we've heard of deep cuts at Team17, and more job losses on Dragon Age. We consider these examples and more, and consider whether each is part of a wider pattern, or a more individual example. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

News of layoffs at Telltale began circulating after cinematic artist Jonah Huang - who's worked at the studio in both its current and original incarnation, which closed down in 2018 - claimed the studio "laid most of us off early September".


Huang also appeared to imply further troubles for The Wolf Among Us 2 - which was originally due to release this year before Telltale pushed it back into 2024 to avoid burnout and crunch - saying he couldn't comment on the status of its development due to a binding NDA.

For the King 2, which is set some 20 years after the events of the first game, promises another bout of optionally co-operative rogue-like adventuring - this time for up to four pals both locally and online - as players take on the kingdom of Fahrul's tyrannical queen. 


Everything shown so far suggests the sequel is more about refinement than radical reinvention, meaning you should expect the same blend of familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - with some neat story generation through and randomised narrative events, only this time with a few notable tweaks.

As reported by IGN, former Bungie HR manager Ingrid Alm - who joined the studio in May 2022 - filed a complaint in the state of Washington earlier this year, citing retaliation and wrongful termination. Alm alleges she was fired from Bungie after being asked to investigate a Black employee, referred to as "James Smith" in court documents, who responded by saying he felt he was being racially targeted by his supervisor.


As a result, Alm recommended Smith's supervisor receive diversity training, but says her suggestion was met with "hostility and denial" - it's claimed she was told the supervisor had "been there for a long time" and was "highly regarded" - and her recommendation was denied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a week after announcing it was delaying fishing horror Dredge's first paid expansion, The Iron Rig, into 2024, developer Black Salt Games has unveiled an entirely different paid expansion, The Pale Reach, which arrives on 16th November.


The Pale Reach plots a course for a "new, frozen frontier", where players will need to navigate treacherous icy canyons - soon also likely to succumb to the malevolence seen elsewhere in the game - following the trail of a long-forgotten expedition to see what became of its crew.


It's a trip that'll first require players to equip their boat with specialised gear capable of smashing through the ice, and once the voyage is underway, there'll be new story content, 11 new fish and crab species (as well as their aberrated counterparts), a new fish type, plus new achievements and trophies. Black Salt Games also teases a new item that'll extend "the freshness of catches no matter where you're fishing", over on the PlayStation Blog.

Following its recently released Phantom Liberty expansion and the base game's extensive 2.0 update, developer CD Projekt Red has announced a partnership with Anonymous Content to develop a brand-new, live-action story set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077. I wonder if they will bring Idris Elba and Keanu Reeves back for the occasion?


This live-action project is still in the very early stages of development, with the studios involved still on the hunt for a screenwriter to take the lead.


While the search continues, several members from media company Anonymous Content have been confirmed to be on board. Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, and Bard Dorros will all be part of this project's production, which CDPR said will be developed in "close collaboration" with Cyberpunk 2077's creative team.

Pokétsume has been made in collaboration with The Pokémon Company, and stars actress and former girl group member Nishino Nanase as Madoka Akagi, an adult who finds out the working world is not how she dreamt it would be. Her mother sends her her old Game Boy and Pokémon Red cartridge, and she decides to start playing Pokémon again.
As she carries on playing Pokémon Red, Madoka begins to find the same energy as her game character to work through her hardships in real life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Rockstar quietly added a 60fps toggle to Red Dead Redemption on PlayStation 5. The game, which was released back in August for both PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, can be played on PS5 thanks to backwards compatibility. And now, that little toggle gives PlayStation 5 users a new framerate to play around with while exploring the Wild West. 


However, there are some Xbox Series X/S players who are now feeling rather left out by Rockstar, asking where their 60fps Red Dead Redemption port is.


When Rockstar brought Red Dead Redemption to PlayStation 4 and Switch, it directed its Xbox community to the original 360 version of the game. As Digital Foundry noted earlier this year, the Xbox Series X and One X versions of Red Dead Redemption are running on the 360 code, with a higher resolution, anisotropic filtering, and a negative LOD bias to enhance texture mip-maps.

The complaints were made by researcher Leon Y. Xiao, who has conducted studies on the effectiveness of Belgium's loot box ban and the consistency of loot box warnings on games.  
Xiao filed complaints regarding Hutch Games for Rebel Racing on the Google Play Store and F1 Clash - Car Racing Manager on the Apple App Store, and said that both games failed to mention the presence of loot boxes. Current ASA guidance states advertising must make it clear if loot boxes exist in a game, with a notification on store pages at a minimum.

The news comes from streaming insider Zack Bussey and has since been corroborated by GamesIndustry.biz. The layoffs are said to be limited to the customer experience team as the company shifts to outsourced vendors.


The layoffs are also fewer than the 400 employees who lost their jobs during Amazon cuts in March.

Presenting Elephant Mario 64, a combination of work between a group of modders, known as SM64ex-coop, to add Elephant Mario to Super Mario 64. He's fully playable, minus any Elephant form abilities, and is complete with a tiny tail sticking out from his overalls.
The model was made by modder Koop the Koopa, with some alterations from YouTuber Unreal (no, not that one) to allow for colour customisation. The bottom of Elephant Mario's feet are pink and can't be changed due to how the model is structured, Unreal notes, but I rather like it. It makes it look like he's got a bunch of toe beans on his soles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has alleged that Hyenas, the recently cancelled space-set loot shooter from Creative Assembly, was Sega's "biggest budget game ever".


YouTube channel Volound shared an eye-opening video on the recent cancellation, with claims from anonymous developers detailing a "total lack of direction" around the game, with one contributor stating many members of the leadership team were "asleep at the wheel but they never seemed to lose their jobs". The same source noted an engine change and "not committing to doing anything adventurous with the game" were all part of Hyenas' ultimate demise. 


Another contributor said that internal feedback on the game was poor, adding it was felt that Hyenas would "melt into the background of an already saturated multiplayer shooter market". These claims have since also been corroborated by VGC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five former Ubisoft staff members have been detained by police and questioned over allegations of sexual misconduct while employees of the company.


These ex-employees included the company's now-disgraced chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, once the right-hand man to Ubisoft's overall boss Yves Guillemot, as well as its former editoral boss Tommy François, French newspaper Libération reported today.


The five ex-Ubisoft employees were reportedly picked up by police over the past 24 hours and questioned at a police station in Paris. The action comes three years after claims of sexual misconduct involving Hascoët, François and others came to light, as part of a wave of allegations that rocked Ubisoft in the summer of 2020. Both Hascoët and François departed the company shortly afterwards.

Shared on X, formerly Twitter, the four screenshots show some new areas: an interior home and shop, a vivid forest, a mermaid fountain in (presumably) the town square, and a creepy library with a peering skeleton.


That forest screenshot also shows the character shooting at a leafy creature with a bow and arrow, suggestive of the increased combat focus compared with Stardew.

Fans of the game began receiving emails yesterday from Gearbox Publishing, née Perfect World Entertainment, inviting them to play Gigantic from 5th to 7th October.

Gigantic was released in 2017 as an Xbox One and PC exclusive. Almost exactly one year later, developer Motiga closed Gigantic following its struggle to "break through in a crowded market". The game was delisted and its servers were shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's launch, Nintendo released a quietly devastating trailer for its game that showed a real life, 'everyday' man going about his business in a rather subdued manner. 


Even his home life seemed to have become mundane, with him and his wife only really seeing each other briefly after a long day in the office, before she popped off to bed. Well, thank goodness for Zelda, as not only did Tears of the Kingdom give a welcome boost to our suffering man's evening, it now seems that it has also improved his marriage. 


In a new trailer, we are once again reunited with Nintendo's sad man and his wife, and once again, he is playing Zelda. But, oh! He seems to be having a bit of trouble with one of the game's many shrines. His partner looks over, and gives some sage advice. "Ah, that's how it's done," he seems to think, while throwing her an adoring smile (honestly, it is so pure and lovely, and kind of the way my dog looks at food).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced it is ending online play services for both the 3DS and Wii U. These services will be terminated "as of early April 2024," the company wrote in an update earlier today. 


Nintendo has been steadily winding down its support for these older consoles, having sunsetted the eShop for both platforms last year. Of course, this had no effect on the online play capabilities of the games. 


However, as of April next year, games on either the Wii U or 3DS will only be playable offline. This means "online cooperative play, internet rankings and data distribution" will also be affected. It also means no more online town hopping in Animal Crossing: New Leaf (pictured above).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's MineCon Live - developer Mojang's annual celebration of all things Minecraft - is right around the corner, and ahead of the big day on 15th October, the studio is holding its yearly mob vote, with choice number one having now been revealed as the crab.


Minecraft's annual mob vote, if you're unfamiliar, gives players the chance to collectively decide on the creature they'd like to see added to the blockbusting survival sandbox next. Previously mob votes have resulted in the likes of the Glow Squid, Panda, Phantom, Llama, and Sniffer all ending up in-game, and the crab is now vying for a place in that illustrious line-up.


As per Mojang's animated video introducing the crab, should voters shunt the little fella into first place, it'll be found within the mangrove swamp biome. We're also told about its crab claw, which, once acquired, will enable players to place blocks further away than would normally be possible - a bit of a builder-focused utility, then, this one.

Warcraft Rumble - formerly known as Warcraft Arclight Rumble - promises a blend of strategy and tower defense across a its 70-mission single-player campaign, which features some familiar heroes and villains from the Warcraft universe, including Warsong chieftain Grommash Hellscream and Archmage Jaina Proudmoore.


In order to tackle Rumbles' various scenarios, players must assemble an army, choosing leaders, troops, and spells from the game's 65+ collectible character Minis, each of which has its own distinctive "talents" for use in battle. These also come into play across Rumble's other modes and features, including co-op, PvP, guilds, raids, and dungeons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dene Carter, perhaps best known as the co-creator of the original Fable and developer Bullfrog's much-loved Dungeon Keeper, has released his brand new Ultima-inspired roguelike RPG Moonring on Steam, and he's made it completely free.


Carter describes Moonring as a "retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games" - albeit one "created from the ground up with modern design sensibilities" - and it all plays out across the mysterious land of Caldera, a place of "Devotion and Dreamers, Gods and Gifts", where players take on the role of Dreamless.


"Travel, trade, sneak, fight and sail the world of Caldera," teases Moonring's Steam page. "Speak with the townsfolk, learn Caldera's secrets, and challenge the Archon for his throne... or even overthrow the Gods themselves!".

The controller is inspired by the official Shadow range of controllers released during the lifetime of the Xbox One. It has a gold-to-black metallic finish on the front, creating an illusion of a shadow cast at the bottom of the grips, while the rest of the controller is carbon black.

The gold metallic finish extends to the D-pad. There are rubberised diamond-pattern side grips, unlike your bog standard Xbox controller.

Gotham Knights got a mixed response from our Chris Donlan upon its release last year. He called it a "slight muddle of a game", but noted it still "has its pleasures" in Eurogamer's review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic has announced it's introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it calls its evolution into a "multi-game ecosystem".


Third-party developed content in Fortnite has become an increasing focus for Epic in recent times, and the company introduced its Unreal Editor for Fortnite tools - also known as Creative 2.0 - back in March. These enable creators to bring fully fledged Unreal Editor experiences into Fortnite, complete with custom assets, animations, audio, and advanced VFX effects, in a bid to turn the game into a creator-led platform closer to the likes of Roblox.


And now, as its "multi-game ecosystem" ambitions grow, Epic has announced it'll be making age ratings mandatory for all first- and third-party playable experiences in Fortnite as of 14th November this year.

This bundle is set to release alongside the game on 20th October. As with earlier bundles for the likes of God of War: Ragnarök and Horizon Forbidden West, it will come with the standard PS5 console and a voucher to download a copy of the game.


While Sony hasn't officially released a price for this upcoming deal, according to Kotaku the bundle will cost $560 (so around £465), offering a small saving on buying the console and game separately. This is also cheaper than the previously announced Marvel's Spider-Man 2 limited edition bundle, which includes themed-hardware. That deal will set you back £569.99.

This patch addresses a range of issues across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including general fixes and character specific adjustments. However, the Nintendo Switch version of the game remains left out in the cold, at least for now, despite Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon previously promising fixes.


Sharing the patch notes online, Boon said the team will "kontinue to listen" and keep "lines of communication open" as it continues to improve its game (I just wish Boon would be a little more konsistent with his use of Ks).

Mediatonic was acquired by Epic in 2021. Last week, Mao stated they have received "no royalty payment" since the acquisition and voiced their frustration on Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports FC 24 players are fuming at an Ultimate Team mode card pack costing around £30.


The Elite Season Opener Pack costs 285,000 coins (the in-game currency) or 3000 FC Points (premium currency) and seemingly includes such powerful cards that players are accusing EA of pay-to-win tactics.


And this is a microtransaction in a game that already costs £70.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 fans, rejoice! For Larian has heard the cries of the people and addressed, nay fixed the glaring issue it introduced with patch three.

I'm talking about, of course, His Majesty the cat. Formerly a sphynx cat, he was changed into a different breed to differentiate him between another bald cat encountered later on in the story.

I've been slowly chugging through Baldur's Gate 3 and two months after its release on PC, I finally reached Act Two this weekend. Upon meeting His Majesty for the first time last night, my initial reaction was "ah, this is the bald cat everyone was upset about," and I can understand why. With the hair, he just doesn't command the same respect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar is yet to share details about Grand Theft Auto 6, but fans are convinced an announcement of some sort is imminent. Why? Because of the moon.


The developer recently released a new image for GTA Online's Moon Festival, which you can see above. This image was shared as part of a blog post about GTA Online which - on the surface at least - was all fairly standard stuff.


But it's the Moon Festival image which is getting attention - as some fans believe Rockstar is actually teasing the series' next entry in this seemingly straightforward picture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been eyeing up Pioneers of Pagonia, the lovely looking new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich, there's some good news; ahead of its early access launch on 13th December, a demo is now available on Steam.


Pioneers of Pagonia was revealed back in February, promising a city building adventure set across the mysterious islands of Pagonia, where players must work to steadily increase their reach and influence among the islands' many (not always friendly) inhabitants through resource gathering, production, economic expansion, and exploration.


When Pioneers of Pagonia enters early access in December, only some of its final features will be available, including procedural map generation, over 40 different building types, plus more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. The likes of co-op play, new buildings, new production chains, and other improvements are expected to arrive in the six months or so of development planned ahead of a full 1.0 release.

Galyonkin's career in the games industry spans more than two decades but he gained renown after establishing Steam Spy in 2015, a project he continued to run after joining Epic as Eastern European head of publishng in 2016. A year later, Galyonkin became the company's director of publishing strategy, with a specific focus on Epic's store, and he's remained in that role since. 


Now, though, Galyonkin has revealed his time at the company is over. "Today is officially my last day at Epic Games," he wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. "These eight years have been some of the most exciting in my career, and I am deeply grateful to my former Epic Games colleagues and Tim Sweeney for allowing me to help build Epic 4.0."

Want to know more about Trek to Yomi? Well, let me quickly samurai-se it for you. In Trek to Yomi, which is set in Japan during the Edo period, players take on the role of a young warrior named Hiroki. Hiroki will have to face the "forces of evil" as he tries to make amends for failing to protect his village from a brutal onslaught.


The Black-and-white samurai curio is set to leave the service on 16th October, so if you were interested in taking up your sword and having a go for yourself, but hadn't managed to get round to it yet, this is a little reminder to snap it up while you can.

The rebranded FIFA bumped boxed game juggernaut Hogwarts Legacy into third place in terms of the biggest 2023 UK physical game launches. Only The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold more. 


While boxed sales are declining across the board, annual mass market titans FIFA and Call of Duty have held onto a sizable - if shrinking - slice of physical sales. A further drop in boxed numbers this year was somewhat inevitable, though a 30 percent fall is something of a jump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new bug has been discovered in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet which causes the game to crash during the last battle of its main story questline.

The bug appears to have been introduced with patch 2.0.1, which rolled out alongside the DLC The Teal Mask on 13th September.

Players have identified what triggers the game to crash and work-arounds whilst the bug persists. Here's the short version - if you have already registered the Legendary Paradox Pokémon which is native to your version of the game, don't try to swap Pokémon in slots four to six of your party into battle. Light spoilers below for the long version.

Around 50 roles - the vast majority of Team17's QA department - are at risk as part of a major restructuring process, as the company opts to outsource its QA work instead.

The exhibit at the museum in Amsterdam consists of six paintings of Pokémon in the style of Van Gogh, accompanied by a range of exclusive merchandise and a special Pikachu trading card. Sadly, footage of the exhibit's opening day, showed visitors hurriedly grabbing whatever merch they could to resell.

The merch was also available to buy on Pokémon Center webstores, though it quickly sold out. The items appear to have been prevented from appearing when searching on the UK Pokémon Center website, though the pages can still be found through search engines.

In addition, the developer has said it will now "intensify" Payday 3's commercial activities, having put these on pause as it tried to sort out those matchmaking issues. This will include an update, due early this month, that will see "200+" quality of life improvements added across platforms.

That's according to Bethesda boss Todd Howard himself, who said in a Game Maker’s Notebook interview with Insomniac CEO Ted Price that after watching how players interact with other Bethesda RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout, he believes "people want to play [games] for a very long time".

"This is a game that's intentionally made to be played for a long time. One of the things we’ve learned from our previous games, like Skyrim, like Fallout, is that people want to play them for a very long time," said Howard, as transcribed by VGC.

It's one of four designs issued by Foxdata in the late 1990s, which included controllers called Desert Storm, Red Rain, Purple Forest, and Chrome Leopard. 

Liam Clousdale – who had the latter Leopard variant – said he'd asked for the distinctive controller so that when he went to his friends' homes to play, "everyone liked to have their own unique pad [...] to avoid confusion".

Just days after announcing its $3.6bn Bungie buyout bid, Sony announced back in April 2022 that it would launch more than 10 new live service games over the next four years, with the hope that Destiny developer Bungie would aid PlayStation in this major expansion of live service game development.

On 7 September, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) asked for feedback on proposed guidelines that, for the first time in the United States, would require research projects involving cephalopods to be approved by an ethics board before receiving federal funding.</p></blockquote>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a bit of bad news if you've been looking forward to fishing horror Dredge's first paid expansion: developer Black Salt Games has delayed its release from Q4 this year into 2024.


More Dredge, both free and paid, was confirmed to be on the way back in May, with the game's The Iron Rig expansion - focusing on the machinations of the Ironhaven Corporation - looking to be its most significant chunk of new content.


"Originally, we planned to spend a few months crafting this exciting addition and release it in Q4 this year," Black Salt Games explained in its delay announcement. "However, as we progressed, we were faced with the reality that, given the time of the year, we'd need more lead time to coordinate our marketing and make the launch as exciting as it could be."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt has detailed Cyberpunk 2077's first patch since the sci-fi RPG's big 2.0 update, promising, among other things, a fix for a save corruption issue affecting PlayStation 5 players.


As per the developer's newly shared pre-release patch highlights, update 2.01 should stop instances of corrupt saves on PS5 by increasing the maximum save file size limit. CD Projekt warns this won't fix saves impacted before the update, but advises affected players to keep a working save - by resaving it as a manual save - until 2.01 arrives.


Elsewhere in the update, CD Projekt is promising performance improvements on both PC and consoles, particularly in the Dogtown area, as well as a range of more specific fixes, included one especially specific issue that would see V sinking through the elevator floor and plummeting to their doom when attempting to reach the 42nd floor in Cyberpunk 2077's The Heist mission - but only in instances of low FPS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mediatonic, the UK developer behind Fall Guys, has been severely impacted by expected job losses as a result of yesterday's layoffs by Epic Games, though the studio itself will not be closed.


Epic Games acquired Mediatonic back in March 2021 after the studio's battle royale Fall Guys blew up in popularity. The deal was meant to secure Mediatonic's future. Now, despite the studio remaining open, that future looks very different indeed.


Last night, rumours swirled that the cuts were so deep the whole studio would close. But this isn't the case, team members I've spoken to have said, and Epic Games itself has now confirmed.

According to the game's publisher Gala Games, which specialises in this blockchain/Web3 business, Legacy's upcoming launch is "more than just a game release". In its words, this is "the beginning of an extraordinary journey where creativity, strategy, and business innovation meet". 


As someone who remains more than a touch sceptical about blockchain, I feel this remains to be seen.

In a new post over on X (formerly Twitter), Boon shared an image of some of media's most famous slasher-flick faces. Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, Jason, Mike Myers, Pinhead, Chucky, Jigsaw, and Ghostface all showed up in Boon's image, with a collection of either ticks or question marks across their faces. 


Many have surmised this means these less than friendly faces will soon be making their way into Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the game's DLC. As one fan noted in the replies, "Jigsaw would be perfect with the new Saw coming out".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer and Sony seem to be slowly removing traces of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake from the internet, sparking more concern that its future is in jeopardy. 


It has certainly been a tumultuous journey for this remake. After numerous leaks, Aspyr and Sony officially revealed their remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was in development back in 2021. At this time, it was announced the Star Wars game was being remade "from the ground up", and would launch as a timed console exclusive for PlayStation 5, and also for PC.


Since then, news on the remake has been less than optimistic. In May 2022, Aspyr's parent company Embracer announced that Evil Dead developer Saber Interactive had joined up with Aspyr to work on the remake. Then, in July, it was reported that the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake was "in serious trouble" and "delayed indefinitely".

Sega had previously teased the update would bring new playable characters, but now the update is live we know for sure it's those three. Though let's be honest, it was pretty obvious.


The update brings a new story expansion, which takes place before the final boss and envisions an alternative ending, with the three characters attempting to change their own fate. Check out the trailer below to see them in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we bid farewell to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who has announced his departure from the company after almost three decades of service. 
We look back at Ryan's tenure at the top of Sony's console business, which included the launch of PlayStation 5 and the acquisition of Bungie. Sony has seen huge sales successes, of course, but is this down to the company's continued direction or simply an open goal from the last console generation? 
Announced just before we recorded this week's show, we also discuss the shock cancellation of Hyenas, the loot shooter from Sega's UK studio Creative Assembly that was being demoed to the public only last month. Such a last-minute scrubbing of a game launch is startling - we discuss why the decision may have been made.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's next fully fledged Elder Scrolls game might still be five-plus years away from release, but if you're truly suffering from series withdrawal symptoms, the company has just unceremoniously shoved a Fallout Shelter-style Elder Scrolls game onto Google Play.


As spotted by IGN, The Elder Scrolls: Castles is now available to download, tasking players with managing their own, yes, castle through a steady process of room-by-room expansion, while also dealing with the whims of their kingdom - by deciding how to respond to their subjects' requests, Reigns-style - at the same time.


Oh, and there's a questing element too, in which players will need to create heroes, kit them out with gear, and send them into battle against "classic Elder Scrolls foes" in order to collect resources that'll come in hand elsewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five years after its initial unveiling, developer Mojang has confirmed development on Minecraft Dungeons has reached its end, and that the game's 1.17 update - which released ten months ago, back in November 2022 - will be its last.


Minecraft Dungeons, a collaboration between Mojang and developer Double Eleven, was well-received when it launched in May 2020 - Eurogamer's Tom Phillips called it a "strong extension to the franchise, and by far the most promising Minecraft spin-off released to date" at the time.


By the time February 2021 rolled around, Minecraft Dungeons had amassed over 10m players, and was popular enough that a second season pass of DLC content was announced after its first came to and end. Mojang then announced it would introduce a live-service style seasonal model - complete with battle pass - as 2021 drew to a close.

Play-throughs of Subpar Pool are procedurally generated based on parameters players can set beforehand by combining cards from a special 18-strong deck to suit their particular whims, with more than 14,000 combinations said to be possible.

Earlier today, InnerSloth, Sony, Schell Games and Robot Teddy announced that social deduction game Among Us will be coming to PS VR2. So, get ready to grab your Crewmates and then subsequently betray them all with a quick slice here or a subtle tongue impaling here. You know, as you do. 


When Among Us makes its way onto PS VR2, players can expect the usual likes of tasks, sabotages, venting, and those frantic emergency meetings where accusations begin to fly left, right and centre. But in addition to all this, Among Us VR on PS VR2 will also include new tasks and new features designed specfically for virtual reality. This includes 3D cosmetics, proximity voice chat, accessibility and comfort settings, safety and in-game moderation tools, crossplay compatibility, and custom lobby settings.

Around 250 employees will leave the company as a result of Epic's newly announced divestiture of Bandcamp and SuperAwesome.


"For a while now," Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote in an all-staff email now shared on the company's website, "we've been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators. I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.

With this update in play, any captures stored on the Xbox network will now be deleted after 90 days. Users can check on their captures' status via the  Captures app, where any images coming close to that 90 day limit will be flagged. 


As is apparent with this "new retention approach", Xbox users will need to ensure any captures they wish to keep for more than that 90 day period are backed up elsewhere or risk losing them forever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has failed to convince the European Union's Court of Justice that it did not infringe EU law by geo-blocking activation keys on Steam.


Five other video game publishers were also found to have breached anti-competitive practices: Bandai Namco, Capcom, Focus Home, Koch Media and ZeniMax. 


As a reminder, the European Commission announced plans back in 2017 to investigate Valve and the aforementioned PC game publishers over suspected anti-competitive practices.

As you might expect, the Van Gogh Pikachu is designed to look like he was painted by the Dutch master himself. Better yet, the trading card is free - if you can make the trip over and visit in person. 


The Van Gogh exhibit is open from today, 28th September, until 7th January 2024.

Ryan - whose official job title is president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment - took charge of the PlayStation division back in February 2019, having previously helmed Sony Computer Interactive Europe.


In a statement announcing his retirement, Ryan wrote, "I've relished the opportunity to have a job I love in a very special company, working with great people and incredible partners. But I've found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew Meta Quest 3 was on the way after Meta made its latest consumer VR headset official back in June - just days ahead of Apple's Vision Pro reveal - but the company has now slapped it with a 10th October launch date, and pre-orders are open now.


April's initial unveiling confirmed some top-level features for Meta's new VR headset - which is now more accurately described as a mixed reality headset - but we now have a much clearer idea of the specs being packed into this third iteration of Quest.


Meta Quest 3 is powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor - which Meta says can manage "double the graphic processing" of Quest 2 - and it includes 8GB of RAM. It also sports two 120Hz LCD displays, each delivering a resolution of 2064 x 2208 - described as a 30 percent increase compared to Quest 2 - plus a 110-degrees horizontal and 96-degrees vertical field of view. Lenses have an adjustable IPD ranging from 58mm-71mm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you follow up a five-star treat like Dave the Diver? With a zombie-themed, 16-player PvPvE stealth-survival extraction game, of course! Developer Mintrocket has just unveiled its next project, titled Nakwon: Last Paradise, and it's about as much a departure from its acclaimed snorkelling-and-sushi-restaurant-management adventure as you can get, dropping players onto the streets of Seoul, right into the middle of the undead apocalypse.


As per Mintrocket's lengthy Steam announcement, Nakwon's action is split into two main parts; on the Scouting side, players - with a friend in tow if desired - must leave the relative comforts of the titular safe zone to venture into the zombie-infested outskirts of Seoul. Here, the goal is to scavenge resources then escape back to safety, but other players and, of course, the AI-controlled undead, won't make that an easy task. 


Mintrocket stresses that zombies in Nakwon are very much the hunters, and cannot be defeated. Instead, players - primarily armed with makeshift weaponry and tools rather than undead-shredding firepower, given the scarcity of guns - must navigate the streets as stealthily as possible to avoid detection, fleeing when necessary. And should they successfully make it back to the safe zone alive (it looks like players can come and go as they like, regardless of what other Survivors might be doing) the Simulation side of Nakwon begins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's promisingly outlandish Far Cry animated adaptation is almost upon us, with the series - titled Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix - set to hit the streaming service on 19th October. And ahead of its arrival, Netflix has shared a fresh trailer showcasing its chaotic action, this one welcoming Rayman and a bunch of other familiar Ubisoft faces.


Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix takes its cue from Ubisoft's gleefully ludicrous, 80s-inspired Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon. It's set in an alternate version of Earth's 1992 where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data.


Enter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before sailing off into the sunset with his boyfriend Alex. Unfortunately, Laserhawk is betrayed by said boyfriend, landing him in high-security facility with no choice but to join forces with an unlikely bunch of rebels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roughly two years after Netflix announced plans for a Tomb Raider anime, we've finally been given our first look at Lara Croft in cartoon action. 


The Tomb Raider animation is set to focus on the events following the reboot trilogy's conclusion. Lara has returned from her travels in South America, having prevented an apocalypse of some description, and is now ready for her next adventure. 


Netflix's debut trailer is quite brief, featuring a lot of heavy breathing from our heroine over the top of a handful of impactful shots. We get to see Lara abseiling into a cavernous abyss and - perhaps in homage to one of Shadow of the Tomb Raider's better moments - emerging onto the scene while a backdrop of flames silhouettes her (presumably) rather battle weary figure. There is also a nice little nod to the Yamatai crew from the 2013 reboot, with Lara tenderly stroking a photo of her fallen friends (although, no Alex? And, I know Jonah is still alive).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to 2018, and you might recall Adi Shankar - the producer of Netflix's acclaimed Castlevania adaptation - announcing he also had a Devil May Cry animated series in the works. Five years on, and the streaming service has now given us a first look at the show, which is supposedly coming "soon".


Netflix's animated Devil May Cry series has been made in collaboration with Capcom, and comes from Studio Mir - the animation team behind the likes of The Legend of Korra and My Adventures with Superman.


Beyond that, details are almost entirely non-existent at present, although Netflix's announcement trailer does at least gives us a quick look at the adaptation's interpretation of Dante, who looks to be well and truly in "cocky pretty boy" mode for this outing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports earlier this year that Far Cry 7 is currently in the works at Ubisoft, story and gameplay details have emerged claiming the game will see players attempting to rescue their wealthy family, who've been kidnapped by a group calling itself the Sons of Truth.


That's according to Insider Gaming, who first reported news of Far Cry 7's development - later corroborated by Kotaku - back in January. Citing undisclosed "sources", the website says Far Cry 7, codenamed Project Blackbird, will feature a "non-linear" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.


Supposedly, the main goal of Far Cry 7 is to bring down the Sons of Truth, described as a "conspiracy group", within that time frame (the timer is said to stop while within certain locations, such as safehouses), but it's claimed players will also need to track down and rescue their family members along the way in order to "100%" the game.

Poncle hasn't laid all the specifics of Vampire Survivors new Chilling Update (also known as patch 1.7, and also also seemingly known as Whiteout), but its trailer drop came with confirmation it'll feature a brand-new wintery stage, complete with snow-covered pines and more snowmen than you can shake an arm-shaped stick at, plus a brand-new character.


As to the identity of this newcomer, I really couldn't say beyond the fact they have a fetching hood, based on the information currently available, but Poncle's new trailer does confirm patch 1.7 will introduce the Glass Fandango as a new weapon - "stronger with movement, Orologions, and against frozen enemies" - plus new achievements, and probably a bunch of other stuff I've missed because I have, alas, only recently begun my Vampire Survivors journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red has apologised for the Ukrainian localisation of Cyberpunk 2077 due to language which could be "considered offensive by Russian gamers" which was added in the 2.0 update last week and said it is working to add the "correct lines" in the next patch.

Website Zone of Games discovered differences between the English and Ukrainian scripts with altered dialogue. Since publishing its initial report, other differences within the versions of the game have surfaced.

As reported by our mates at Rock Paper Shotgun, the changes include swapping the word "asshole" to "rusnia", a Ukrainian derogatory word for Russians. The localisation also has allusions to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, such as a reference to "Russian warship, go fuck yourself", the response of a Ukrainian border guard to a Russian warship in a widely circulated encounter near Snake Island.

This edition of Aloy's latest escapades includes the base game and DLC Burning Shores, along with a selection of extras.


On PlayStation 5, the Complete Edition will launch on 6th October priced $60 / €60 / ¥7,980. I am assuming this will convert to roughly £55 here in the UK, but have emailed Sony to ask for clarification. 


The Complete Edition will then be available for PC players via Steam and Epic Game Store sometime in early 2024. This version is being handled by Nixxes Software, which was also responsible for this year's Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart PC release.

Speaking with the Financial Times, Guillemot looked back on Netflix's initial foray into streaming and noted the market's early scepticism. "Their shares fell a lot and they were widely criticised," he recalled. "Today, we see what they have become."


Guillemot said he believes the same will eventually ring true for video game streaming as well, but admitted it will likely take some time. "But when it takes off, it will happen very quickly," he said.

Complete with Keanu Reeves' face at the bottom of the screen, tight corridors and downsampled tracks from Cyberpunk 2077's OST, it's got 90s FPS written all over it. That's not all though, as players have also discovered it relates to the long-running FF:06:B5 Easter egg present in other CD Projekt Red games.

The Bethesda space RPG's many planets still feature environmental hazards, such as extreme temperatures and radiation. But the impact these have on your character is now fairly minimal - whereas previously this system would have seen players having to swap spacesuits to meet local conditions.


Bethesda boss Todd Howard revealed the change during an episode of the Game Maker's Notebook podcast, which is well worth a watch. In it, Howard discusses the challenges of creating interesting planets, fun space combat, and what changed during Starfield's development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen - who retired from the studio back in 2016, only to rejoin at the end of last year - has been made executive creative director of Warcraft.


Prior to his departure in 2016, Metzen, who had been with Blizzard for 23 years at that point, was head writer and lore guru at the company (more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) with a hand in all the studio's properties.


Since rejoining Blizzard, however, Metzen has been solely focused on Warcraft (in the role of franchise creative advisor), and his new executive creative director position will continue in much the same vein, seeing Metzen focus exclusively on developing the Warfraft universe, initially with an eye on "crafting the next generation of [World of Warcraft] adventures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three years after making its PC debut as an Epic Games Store exclusive, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is coming to Steam, with its release date set for 3rd October.


Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 - which originally launched for PS4, Xbox One, and Epic back in September 2020 - combines remakes of developer Neversoft's much-loved skating games into a single, critically acclaimed package. The end result was an experience that thoroughly reinvigorated the two-decade old classics, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman even going as far as to call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 "one of the best games of the generation".


In the three years since its record-breaking release, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has made the jump to Switch, and developer Vicarious Visions (the esteemed studio responsible for the superb remakes) was merged into Blizzard - a move that sadly meant a planned Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 ultimately never saw the light of day.

        <updated>2023-09-26T18:39:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Talos Principle 2, Serious Sam studio Croteam's follow-up to its acclaimed 2014 first-person puzzle adventure, will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 2nd November.


The original Talos Principle served up an often fiendishly cerebral bout of puzzle-solving that played out something like Portal, albeit with a hell of a lot more lasers, a little bit of time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophy. Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle 'rooms' that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress.


As for The Talos Principle 2, it sounds like players can expect more of the same, and generally more all round. Croteam is promising new abilities, including gravity manipulation and mind transference, on top of the mechanics seen in the first game, and it'll all take place across "more than a dozen" new environments - said to be hiding long-buried secrets and forgotten history - that range from a city on the brink of a paradigm shift to the landscapes of a mysterious island.

Banishers unfolds in the frozen North American wilderness, in the year 1695, where ghost hunters (and lovers) Antea Duarte and Red mac Rait are working to protect the living from the spectral dead. Their situation becomes somewhat more complicated when Antea suddenly finds herself unexpectedly dead and also a ghost.


Don't Nod and publisher Focus Entertainment had, as confirmed back in July, originally intended to release Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden on 7th November, but, in a short statement posted to Don't Nod's website today, Focus has now announced a three-month delay.

The information comes from reliable leaker Billbil-kun, who claims The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 will be added to the Essential tier of games for all PS Plus subscribers. 
The Callisto Protocol only came out in December last year, so this is a much cheaper way for those of you on PlayStation to play the game and try it out if you haven't bought it yet.

The game's listing on the App Store has the game available for free but with in-app purchases. Scrolling down, those purchases are listed in full with "Resident Evil 4 (with bonus)" priced at £57.99.


This is more expensive than as currently priced on Steam (£49.99) and PSN (£54.99), but similar to Xbox (£57.98). That's practically unheard of for a mobile game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We may not be getting any big juicy news on Naughty Dog's games or show as part of The Last of Us day today, but we do have a slither of an update for season two of HBO's TV adaptation.


This slither comes from Craig Mazin, showrunner and co-creator of HBO's The Last of Us  adaptation, who has said work on season two will resume "the second" that strike action is officially lifted.


As a reminder, the Writers Guild of America has been on strike for almost five months. However, it was recently announced that a tentative agreement has been reached between the relevant parties for a new three-year contract, something that looks set to end the 146-day strike (thanks, Variety).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth producer Yoshinori Kitase and creative director Tetsuya Nomura have discussed the term JRPG, and shared contrasting opinions.


Nomura said he felt negatively towards the term, while Kitase was more accepting of its use to highlight the different approaches taken by Japanese game companies.


"I'm not too keen on it," Nomura told The Guardian in a new interview. "Certainly, when we started doing interviews for the games that I started making, no one used that term - they just called them RPGs. And then at some point - I can't remember exactly when - people started referring to them as JRPGs. And I'm not really sure what the intent behind that is. It just always felt a bit off to me, and a bit weird. I never really understood it - or why it's needed."

Yes, 2008. We've really been waiting a while.


This is the version of Beyond Good & Evil we've seen in other clips released or leaked over the years, and which Ubisoft released an early trailer for (showing main character Jade and Uncle Pey'j in a car out in the desert).

Of course, catching chocobo is nothing new for the series, but a new social post on X (formerly Twitter) from the game's official account shows how it'll work in Rebirth for the first time, with a video of Cloud catching one of the iconic yellow birds. 


The method actually looks similar to Breath of the Wild, with Cloud sneaking through foliage (and some conveniently spiky yellow flowers) and throwing out some greens as a distraction before mounting the bird.

As reported by PC Gamer, making a particular choice during one of the earlier story quests will lock you out of any future main quests. You can still explore Dogtown, but you won't get to spend time with Idris Elba. Why would you deprive yourself of that opportunity?

The choice which will lock you out is towards the end of Lucretia My Reflection, the fourth main quest. It's a fairly obvious one, but spoiler warning for below if you want to know exactly where it occurs.

As spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user necrolipe, Red Dead Redemption 2 has been rated for Nintendo Switch in Brazil. Eurogamer has since verified this listing, which also details other platforms the game is currently available on.


Developer Rockstar is yet to announce a Switch edition of its Wild West prequel, and it is unclear when the Brazilian ratings board updated its site to include this version. However, this recent revelation comes just one month after the studio added the first Red Dead game to the Nintendo Switch's library.

Ballots were cast by 34,687 members, with 98.32 percent in favour of strike authorisation on the Interactive Media Agreement that covers union members' work on video games.


While this does not guarantee the union will call a strike, the next bargaining session is this week, and this ratchets up the pressure. The leverage of this authorisation could compel movement on either side.

What a journey so far!
Starting from the initial blog post “How we made Kubernetes insanely easy to install” in September 2016, followed by an exciting growth that lead to general availability / “Production-Ready Kubernetes Cluster Creation with kubeadm” two years later.
And later on a continuous, steady and reliable flow of small improvements that is still going on as of today.
What is kubeadm? (quick refresher)
kubeadm is focused on bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters on existing infrastructure and performing an essential set of maintenance tasks. The core of the kubeadm interface is quite simple: new control plane nodes
are created by running kubeadm init and
worker nodes are joined to the control plane by running
kubeadm join.
Also included are utilities…]]></summary>

That tiny nugget of information comes via a new Ask me Anything (AMA) Q&A session, held earlier today on Reddit, in which Poncle occasionally had the opportunity to answer questions that weren't variations on 'Where the bloody hell are the vampires anyway, please?'.


One such question inquired if there were any multiplayer plans for Vampire Survivors beyond the four-player couch co-op mode introduced alongside the Switch release last month, to which Poncle replied in the affirmative.

This year's The Last of Us Day (which, if you're unfamiliar, happens on 26th September to commemorate the in-game date the Cordyceps infection reached critical mass) coincides with the series' tenth anniversary, meaning some fans were hoping developer Naughty Dog might have a few extra-special reveals to mark the occasion. 


Unfortunately, in a tweet clearly intended to manage expectations ahead of time, Naughty Dog wrote, "We're celebrating with a The Last of Us Day stream tomorrow... featuring announcements focused on art, merch, and more. While we're honouring the series' 10-year legacy, we will not be discussing any future game or TV show projects."

All-in-all, it's not a particularly glamorous update, equating to a grand total of ten bullet points in Bethesda's patch notes, but if you've been experiencing the likes of characters not appearing where they should be, blurry textures, or a hitch-y hand scanner, this one's for you.


Full patch details can be found below, and for those wondering when Bethesda might have something more substantial to bring to Starfield, the developer says it's "continuing to work on [the] larger update" that - as we learned a couple of weeks ago - will introduce the likes of Nvidia DLSS support and 32:9 ultrawide monitor support on PC, a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, and a new "Eat" button for food when it eventually arrives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a tumultuous week for Unity, in which the company infuriated a significant portion of the development community by making dramatic changes to its engine licensing terms - only to then partially walk them back - at least one developer has had enough, announcing it'll no longer be porting its acclaimed game to Switch as a direct consequence of Unity's actions.


Last Tuesday, Unity announced changes to its licensing agreement that would have forced developers to pay an additional fee every time a user installed their game. After significant outrage from the development community, with many accusing Unity of a betrayal of trust, the company changed course, saying its new pricing plan would now only apply to developers choosing to use its next Long Term Support version - but, as highlighted by developer Neognosis in a post announcing the cancellation of a Switch port for its acclaimed F-Zero-inspired racer BallisticNG, many developers might not have a choice but to upgrade.
 

"Nintendo has a rolling Unity version requirement for game releases," the studio explained, "and we're already behind the threshold by two years. Two weeks ago this wouldn't have been an issue... [but] by the time we'll have a Switch version of BallisticNG ready, the threshold for Unity versions will exceed the new versions that Unity are pushing their TOS changes with, and we currently have no confidence that they won't try pulling another move or pushing back to their original plans under/beyond this new TOS."

This guide will walk you through using etcd learner mode with kubeadm. By default, kubeadm runs
a local etcd instance on each control plane node.
In v1.27, kubeadm introduced a new feature gate EtcdLearnerMode. With this feature gate enabled,
when joining a new control plane node, a new etcd member will be created as a learner and
promoted to a voting member only after the etcd data are fully aligned.
What are the advantages of using etcd learner mode?
etcd learner mode offers several compelling reasons to consider its adoption

As spotted by PCGN, the issues are numerous and wide-reaching, affecting everything from PvP scores to broken doors to enemies failing to see Guardians, let alone engaging with them.

And yes, the Resident Evil 4 Remake iDevice port is also still on track, too, although Capcom will only commit to a vague "2023" release. Unlike the older Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4 Remake will set you back ¥7990 (£44) and the newly-released DLC, Separate Ways, ¥1000 (£5.50). Again, you can download the game for free and give it a try before you buy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Plaion marked the release of Payday 3 earlier this week by giving away "a month's average salary" to one lucky Londoner.

Choosing London because it's reportedly the city that struggles "most with money management", Plaion set up a cross-city publicity stunt to put the local community to the test and have them follow the trail to a secret location where a "specially-branded van" hosted 2000 fake dollar bills. 

You can see highlights of the promotion in the video below:

As spotted by Wario64 with the help of SteamDB, Hollow Knight: Silksong on Steam has had its first significant update since January 2023, with Team Cherry quietly swapping out a graphic for an updated version.

While it's in no way indicative of an upcoming release date or anything like that – sorry – the changes to the storefront graphics are at least a sign that work is still underway behind the scenes, with the team twice uploading "capsule art" – that is, the artwork you see on the game's storefront – in the last week, the most recent of which was uploaded earlier today.

Little Hope sees you follow a college class after the bus they were travelling in crashed in the middle of the night. As they explore the "seemingly abandoned town", they become trapped by a "mysterious impenetrable fog" and begin to encounter visions of the townsfolk's shocking history.

After a tweet purporting that CD Projekt had "removed the Elon Musk cameo from the Corpo opening in Cyberpunk 2077" went viral, senior quest designer Patrick Mills stepped in to ask, "who came up with this nonsense?".

"That wasn't Elon musk, it looks nothing like him. Who came up with this nonsense?" Mills asked.

After a three-day early access period for some players, Payday 3 released on 21st September, but players have struggled to get online at peak times due to continuing server issues that have shutdown matchmaking, making it impossible to play the always-online heist shooter.

On launch day, Starbreeze took to its social media accounts to admit that it was "currently experiencing slow matchmaking" and was "investigating and working on a solution".

The discovery was made by scientists in France, who used modern imaging technique to analyse the previously discovered fossils. The ancient squid has been named Vampyrofugiens atramentum, which stands for the &#8220;fleeing vampire&#8221;.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten days after Unity successfully enraged huge swathes of the development community by announcing sweeping, and wildly unpopular, changes to its Unity Engine business model, the company has said it's "sorry" and walked back on significant aspects of its new pricing plan.


Last Tuesday, Unity announced that, as of 1st January 2024, developers would be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install on top of their existing licence subscription after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash was immediate and intense, resulting in minor revisions to Unity's initial plan.


Now though, Unity's Marc Whitten has outlined significant changes to last week's announcement in a post on the company's website, beginning with another apology. "I want to start with this: I am sorry," he wrote. "We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback before announcing our new Runtime Fee policy. Our goal with this policy is to ensure we can continue to support you today and tomorrow, and keep deeply investing in our game engine."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Total War: Pharaoh next month, on 11th October, there's a bit of bad news - for some purchasers, at least: developer Creative Assembly has announced it's delaying the title into "early 2024", but only on the Epic Games Store.


It's a bit of an unusual one this, but Creative Assembly says the situation has arisen because it was "recently asked to help support the integration of social functions before we can launch on the Epic Games Store, and we'll need additional time to help make that happen".


Importantly, though, Total War: Pharaoh's 11th October release will remain unchanged on Steam - and all pre-orders made on Epic have been automatically cancelled, should you want to take your business elsewhere. Creative Assembly says all affected customers should receive an email confirming this cancellation directly from the Epic Games Store support team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has once again dropkicked the dreams right out of anyone hoping a whizzier, more powerful Steam Deck might be happening soon; it's now provided a clearer timeframe for what it considers to be the current Steam Deck's minimum life span, saying not to expect any kind of performance upgrade "in the next couple of years".


Valve has, of course, tempered expectations for a souped-up Steam Deck sequel previously; in December, Deck designer Pierre-Loup Griffais said the company would likely keep a single performance spec, ie. the current one, for its handheld gaming PC "a little bit longer", noting any initial hardware improvements would probably focus on screen and battery capacity.


But now, speaking to The Verge, Griffais has indicated that "little bit" will likely be a lot longer, and that any Steam Deck performance upgrades are still some considerable way off. "It's important to us that the Deck offers a fixed performance target for developers," he explained, "and that the message to customers is simple, where every Deck can play the same games."

This was not because he had just used his web-tastic athleticism to save a school bus of children from careering off the side of the road, or swept MJ off her feet (literally) before kissing her while upside down. 


Rather, he was a topic of conversation because Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games remastered its original 2018 game for the PlayStation 5, and at the same time changed up the look of its unmasked hero, Peter Parker. 


While Insomniac said this new model was a better reflection of actor Yuri Lowenthal's facial capture, it caused a certain amount of upset for fans of the original. In fact, when the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man released last year, mods were made to bring Peter Parker's original face back into the game. But, perhaps we should all be less concerned about the two different facial models for Peter and move on. After all, that's what his actor wants. In fact, he just wants people to "get over it".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The third major patch for Baldur's Gate 3 is now being rolled out, and it includes the long-awaited Magic Mirror feature.
Players can now change their character's appearance by finding the Magic Mirror in camp. Everything other than race and subrace of your character can be altered - though it also can't be used to get rid of any "cosmetic modifications that are a consequence of your gameplay choices". Also, origin characters, hirelings and full illithids can't use the Magic Mirror.
Patch three has also added full support for the game on Mac, with Larian Studios recommending any players on Mac remove any mods and reinstall the game fresh before playing.

Scheduled to release in February 2024, Part 2 will debut its new storyline on Mars, a new location for Impact 3rd, which previously contained its galactic adventures on Earth and its moon. Previously thought uninhabitable in Honkai lore, Mars actually offers a "unique civilization and nature"  where "there may also be mysteries hidden behind the daily lives of residents that have yet to be discovered".
In addition to expanding its reach further into the solar system, Part 2 debuts a cast of "new partners from different cultures", introducing brand new main characters and NPCs alongside our shiny new playable character, a Martian native team supporter named Dreamseeker.

A number of crossovers with other franchises are always to be expected, and this Season players will be able to purchase some horror (and horror adjacent) icons as Operators. 
Diablo's Lilith and Inarius (everybody's favourite Mother and Father from hell), He-Man nemesis Skeletor, Evil Dead's Ash Williams, and Alucard from the manga series Hellsing will all be entering the fray.

Measuring 23cm high by 11cm wide, the 540-piece design will launch in the UK on 6th November, at the comparatively affordable (for Lego) price of £58.


This is another of Lego's Super Mario range for older fans (albeit those still young at heart), rather than its kid-focused line of Super Mario sets which interact with its electronic Super Mario, Luigi and Peach toys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A cosy new hobbit-based Lord of the Rings spinoff game has been teased by Wētā Workshop and Private Division. Yes, it is actually happening.


Tales of the Shire was announced to celebrate Hobbit Day, and promises to provide a snuggly "heart-warming" experience set in Tolkein's Middle-earth universe. It's coming from Wētā Workshop and Private Division and will arrive sometime next year. Needless to say, I am more than a little bit excited.


To accompany this announcement, a small teaser was also released. It is short and suitably charming, showing a young person humming as she sits at a table strewn with flora and art supplies. There are also modern bits and pieces, such as headphones. She is painting in a book, and while I have nothing to base this on other than my hunch, she looks to be painting herself as a hobbit. Could this be Tales of the Shire's soon to be pint-sized protagonist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a positive development for Microsoft, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has "provisionally concluded" the company's revised deal to purchase Activision Blizzard will be enough to grant approval.


Back in April, the CMA made the shock decision to block Microsoft's proposed deal to acquire the Call of Duty maker. At this time, the regulatory body cited concerns relating to the cloud gaming sector, stating that the deal risked "stifling competition in this growing market".


In August, Microsoft submitted a revised proposal in a bid to appease the regulator, saying it would now sell the streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard games released in the next 15 years to Ubisoft should the new deal be accepted.
