        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two months on from the release of Starfield, players are still waiting for Bethesda to address the numerous bugs which are present. But there's a whole other group of players out there taking matters into their own hands - the team behind the Starfield Community Patch, an ambitious and surprisingly professional taskforce trying to fix the game themselves. The project came under the spotlight about a month before Starfield released. It was wild to think that a group of modders could already be working on a mod for Starfield before it had even released, but there they were - anticipating the Bethesda jank fans have come to expect. 


The SCP's goal is to improve the vanilla experience of Starfield for players by fixing everything from major bugs to spelling errors, so long as it presents some sort of issue for players of the base game. The scope of the patch doesn't include new content, balance changes (outside of correcting obvious errors), or anything which doesn't fit with Bethesda's original vision for the game.


I spoke to Timothy "Halgari" Baldridge, one of the founders of the SCP, to find out why the team came together to, in essence, do Bethesda's work for them, and ask whether they've ever had any contact with Bethesda. I came away from our chat with a deeper appreciation for the project, which is more than just a simple effort to improve the experience of Starfield. It's a collaborative effort between several modders and players to create a truly community-owned, open-source project, with standard practices of software development in place.

Narrative director Ben Arfmann and advanced writer Brittney Morris discussed how the ending of Spider-Man 2 will impact the likes of Peter, Miles and MJ, and spoke about a change of focus for Insomniac's series.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 in the article below. If you are yet to finish the game, and wish to keep it as much a surprise as possible, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

As previously reported, Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson stated there's "no secret level", but this hasn't stopped fans from hunting for one. There was seemingly a breakthrough made last month, too, after a player acquired a mysterious relic that required killing exactly 666 cows.


Now, at this weekend's BlizzCon 2023, production director Tiffany Wat and associate game director Joe Piepiora hinted the secret cow level might be real after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Comparisons between the OG PS5 and the PS5 Slim are out, and some say the sleeker new design is "not that much smaller" than its chunkier sibling.

Dave2D has provided a detailed teardown of the brand-new console system, showing off the machine's trimmer stature and the console's new outer cover, which now boasts a half matte, half gloss finish. This means any panels bought for the original system cannot be used on the updated one, as it essentially has four separate pieces. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dave2D made specific mention of the weight difference. Whilst the original version weighs in at either 3.9kg or 3.3kg, depending upon whether or not you have the digital version or the system with the disc drive, the new models weighs 3.2kg or 2.6kg respectively.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Epic has had to keep a close eye on server health and capacity, warning players that they may "experience a short queue" before logging in at peak times.

In an interview with GamesRadar at BlizzCon 2023, vice president and executive producer for World of Warcraft Holly Longdale said that whilst the team was currently focussed on the "three expansions" for now, being part of Microsoft's extended family means the team talks about making the game available on other platforms "all the time".

World of Warcraft was released way back in 2004 – which means we're just months away from the MMORPG's twentieth anniversary – and has only been playable on PC for all that time.

Although the first-person shooter doesn't formally release until 10th November, some players who've forked out for the shooter's pricier digital editions can play the campaign early via "early access".

"I played one hour of campaign and got my refund," announced one player. "And I think you should too if you feel the same way I felt. This was a couple lacklustre raid episodes out together; having just finished COD Remastered recently this game failed to capture what it means to be in a campaign, and if this is how it all begins then I’m sorry, MW3 does not redeem itself from the shitshow MW2 caused at launch and somehow continues to make fun of my wallet. I’ll be holding off on touching this game until something positive comes back from this community. Peace."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlizzCon is back - as an in-person event for the first time in four years - and Blizzard kicked off its opening ceremony with a bit of an Overwatch 2 blowout, including a reveal for the series' 39th hero, chaingun-wielding tank Mauga.


Mauga's announcement wasn't, admittedly, much of a surprise, giving he inadvertently got a pre-show unveiling on Switch's eShop news channel, but he's now been made official thanks to BlizzCon. And, as seen in his reveal trailer, Mauga - which means "mountain" in Samoan - is armed with two chainguns: affectionately known as Gunny and Cha-Cha.


Gunny is an incendiary chaingun, whose bullets will burn enemies that receive sufficient damage; Cha-Cha, meanwhile, is a a "volatile" chaingun that deals critical burn damage. Blizzard notes they can either be fired individually or in unison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlizzCon has brought big news for World of Warcraft fans as the MMO prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary next year; Blizzard's announced not only its next expansion, The War Within, but the two coming after that, all forming chapters in the newly revealed Worldsoul Saga.


The Worldsoul Saga was enthusiastically unveiled by Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen, who returned to the company late last year after departing in 2016. This new World of Warcraft story arc is set to play out across multiple expansions over the next few years, starting with The War Within - WoW's tenth expansion - in 2024.


The War Within takes players into heart of Azeroth itself, where they'll explore new subterranean kingdoms, engage with ancient cultures like the Earthen Dwarves - a new Allied race - and the terrifying Nerubians of Azj-Kahet. Azj-Kahet is one of several new zones coming in the expansion, alongside the Isle of Dorn, The Ringing Deeps, and Hallowfall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With this year's BlizzCon now firmly underway, Blizzard has been whipping up the crowds with a bunch of announcements during its Opening Ceremony, including initial details on Diablo 4's first expansion. It's called Vessel of Hatred and it's due "late" next year.


Vessel of Hatred - said to still be "super early" in development - continues the story of base game antagonist Prime Evil Mephisto, and introduces a new region to Diablo 4: the lush jungles of Torajan, last seen in Diablo 2.


Blizzard isn't saying much more about Vessel of Hatred just yet but it does tease that it'll feature "new ways to play", "new evils to vanquish", plus a new class never before see in the Diablo universe. There's also a (not especially informative) teaser trailer to accompany the news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever paused mid-slaughter during a game of Vampires Survivors and thought to yourself, 'Yes, but what's my motivation?', you'll want to ready yourself for the minimalist survival RPG's next free update. As per studio Poncle's latest development update, a new story driven, lore-infused Adventures mode will soon be on the way.


Poncle has teased Adventures before, describing them as a remix of content adding a bit of extra "flavour" through new stage progression and descriptions. Now though, via the medium of FAQ it's gone into considerably more detail, explaining Adventures are essentially self-contained miniature story campaigns - some available as part of the base game, others tied to specific DLC - that'll follow the game's cast of Survivors on a series of "wacky sidequests."


Adventures unlock at set points during the main game or their associated DLC, and feature a unique progression path that'll see players starting from scratch (main game unlocks won't be affected) using a specific character and item set-up as they attempt to complete a series of custom challenges with a limited arsenal. Those challenges might, for instance, require players to survive a certain amount of time or kill a set amount of enemies, and there'll be bits of lore text forming a mini story arc along the way.

Known as Daredevil: The Man Without Fear, this prototype was initially conceived all the way back in 2004, but the full game was never released.

You can find this Daredevil prototype, along with several screenshots, over on Hidden Palace. According to the notes included with the prototype, The Man Without Fear was being developed for the PC, PS2 and Xbox, and was set to be a "third-person beat 'em up" style game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision and Xbox have teamed up to release full screen ads for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 on the console's homepage, which players have since heavily criticised.


As shared by multiple users on social media, the ad in question pops up when players boot up their Xbox. "Fight against the ultimate threat," the screen proclaims. 


It then suggests you perhaps buy the game ahead of its full release later this month (as a reminder, you can play the Campaign early if you pre-order). Your three options are simply "Buy Now", "Get the Vault Edition Upgrade" and, mercifully, the option to "Exit" away from this ad and get on with what you actually booted up your Xbox for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a Dragon developer RGG Studio has revealed Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name was created in half a year, as it was originally conceived as DLC for the next main entry to the series, Infinite Wealth.
Gaiden is a shorter spin-off to the longer campaigns of the main Like a Dragon games, and sees gameplay return to the action brawling roots of the series.
In a new interview with Automaton, studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama and chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto said Gaiden was made in half a year, with the former seemingly making a slight jest at Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 released last month, with the promise of more content to come after launch. This will include a New Game Plus mode, known as The Final Draft, which will add some kind of alternative story.


The game's two DLCs - Night Springs and The Lake House - have also been teased by developer Remedy. Both of these are due to arrive sometime next year, and while the Alan Wake 2 team has alluded to what will be included, dataminers have managed to dig even deeper into the game and found more details about what's next.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Alan Wake 2 and its relation to the Remedy Connected Universe below. If you are keen to keep the game as much of a surprise as possible, this is your cue to head elsewhere.

Players complained that some of the game's bosses were too easy - this is a challenging Soulslike after all - but now the likes of the Sanctified Huntress, Griefbound, the Sundered One, and "a boss at the bottom of a very dark place" will be more formidable.


What's more, the Scarlet Shadow has been made more difficult to cheese - that's the reaper who chases players in Umbral. Now, he no longer takes fall damage and players can no longer hide and shoot him from above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we share our warp pipe dreams for Mario Kart 9, as the final wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC gets its release date.
Nintendo has elongated the lifespan of its Wii U Mario Kart creation to last the entirety of the Switch era - and now we've reached the point where pretty much every track from the series worth playing has been crammed inside. So what's next, if Nintendo can't simply go bigger? Fresh ideas are needed, we feel. 
When will the Mario Kart series get a course creator? Is this the time - so that Nintendo can hand over some creative control to the community, and run the game as more of a live service platform? How about changes to the game's characters, with special abilities to make different racers feel unique? And what about the idea of turning Mario Kart into more of a Nintendo Kart, with additional crossover franchises? Joining me to discuss are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

Every year, just before the official start of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon, there's a special event that
has a very special place in the hearts of those organizing and participating in it: the Kubernetes
Contributor Summit. To find out why, and to provide a behind-the-scenes perspective, we interview
Noah Abrahams, whom amongst other roles was the co-lead for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in
2023.
Frederico Muñoz (FSM): Hello Noah, and welcome. Could you start by introducing yourself and
telling us how you got involved in Kubernetes?
Noah Abrahams (NA): I’ve been in this space for quite a while.  I got started in IT in the mid
90's, and I’ve been working in the "Cloud" space for about 15 years.  It was, frankly, through a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is almost upon us (its campaign early access is upon us for those eager enough to have pre-ordered the game), and system requirements are pointing to an absolutely behemoth install size of more than 200GB in some cases come its full launch next Friday, 10th November - and Activision has now moved to explain what's going on.


In a statement shared on social media, the publisher blamed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's potentially massive hard drive footprint on an "increased amount of content available Day 1", which includes open world Zombies, support for items being carried forward from Modern Warfare 2, plus map files for the current the Call of Duty: Warzone.


The good news for anyone staring at their dwindling gigabytes like they're modelling for Munch's The Scream is that Modern Warfare 3 appears to offer a decent amount of control over exactly which bits are and are not installed. "You can manage your Call of Duty files in the 'manage files' section of the COD HQ launcher menu," Activision notes. "This includes the ability to uninstall specific content you are not actively playing."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a week that's seen significant layoffs at Bungie, as well as reports of a delay for Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion, the studio has told players "we know we have lost a lot of your trust" and promised to reveal plans to "take us all out of this Darkness and into the Light."


Reports of widespread layoffs at Bungie began circulating on Monday, and were later confirmed in statement from studio CEO Pete Parsons. Bloomberg later reported around 100 employees - approximately eight percent of Bungie's 1200-strong workforce - were affected by the job cuts, and that the layoffs followed internal warnings that studio revenue was 45 percent below projections due to a "sharp drop" in the popularity of Destiny 2.


Further reports have continued to paint a bleak picture of Destiny 2's fortunes; pre-orders for The Final Shape are said to be disappointing, while "good" rather than "great" feedback has reportedly lead management to delay the expansion from February to June next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 hasn't exactly had the smoothest of launches; matchmaking issues, online-only requirements, and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system immediately soured its arrival for players back in September, and a highly anticipated first patch promising "200+" quality of life improvements has been repeatedly delayed. Finally though, after much waiting, the heist-shooter's 1.01 update is here on all platforms.


Payday 3's 1.01 update was initially planned to launch on 5th October, but developer Starbreeze delayed its release to mid-October in order to "ensure its stability". After weeks of silence, the developer re-emerged to announced another, this time indefinite delay, explaining it had "identified some issues that need to be fixed".


As the wait has dragged on, Payday 3 player numbers have slumped to the low thousands, with the game's predecessor currently pulling in ten times more than the new version. As such, Starbreeze will doubtless be hoping the long-awaited arrival of 1.01 today will help reverse the game's fortunes. And it's a big one too, weighing in at 2GB (on PC, at least) and spanning an enormous number of improvements and changes.

That's according to HBO boss Casey Bloys (as reported by Variety), who shared the news during an HBO press event held in New York earlier today.


Bloys remarked that the recent WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes meant production on the upcoming season had been delayed. This was first suggested as a possibility earlier this year and has since been confirmed by members of the show's team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 4 team has lifted the lid on its upcoming expansion pack, known as For Rent. As you may have surmised given its title, this pack will allow players to give property ownership a whirl, and become a landlord. 


"Revel in the hustle and bustle of Tomarang, discover unique items at the Night Market, and come home to a new Residential Rental lot where your neighbours are closer than ever," the pack's official description reads. EA and Maxis describe this new location as a "scenic world nestled in a lush tropical landscape and vibrant city skyline". It does look rather nice, I have to say.


Meanwhile, as you will be - in the Sims team's words - closer than ever, this will mean bumping into neighbours left, right and centre. When you collect your post, they will be there. When you join in with a potluck meal event, they will be there. When you head out for a run, they will be there. In short, there will definitely be a lot more happening in your immediate vicinity when this pack goes live.

"Descended from a lineage of distinguished knights, with a dream to rescue those in need, he followed the footsteps of his father and enlisted in the French Navy before joining the UN following his will to save more people," Victor's official bio reads. "As he felt the world was on the brink of being taken over by a corporate giant, he founded and trained the Raven Force - armed forces that have the authority to act at their own discretion to counter the corporation's private armed forces."


You can see him in action, kitted up with a variety of optical weapons, a very sharp suit and insults such as "bon appétit", via the video below.

CEO Jacob Navok's comments come after the game's second night of new content, and amid backlash to its monetisation scheme. 

Navok posted last night on X, formerly Twitter, to respond to a wave of complaints about the game and attempt to explain Ascension's economy, which consists of in-game currency earned by playing mini-puzzles and completing live-service style tasks, whilst also providing context on the removal of global live chat.

Data published by Konvoy as part of its Q3 2023 Gaming Industry Report show a sharp decline in investments following the second quarter of last year. 


As noted by EA Dice senior game designer Jan David Hassel, who shared these graphs on social media, investment in gaming surged to $14.78bn in 2021, and to 14.49bn in 2022. In 2023, this has now slumped to $2.09bn - around "a seventh of the investment of each of the previous two years".

This success has left many travellers to the Lands Between eager for more. Thankfully, current word is that Elden Ring's previously announced DLC expansion is "proceeding smoothly", despite developer FromSoftware not yet announcing any kind of time frame for its arrival on platforms.


This information comes from FromSoftware's parent Kadokawa, via gaming consultant Dr. Serkan Toto. Sharing this update on X (formerly known as Twitter), Toto also added that Armored Core 6 has "sold 700k units in Japan" as of 30th September. However, while it appears Kadokawa is pleased with the game's Japanese sales, it is not so happy about its sales elsewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed Souls-like shooter sequel Remnant 2 is poised to receive its first expansion, The Awakened King, on 17th November, and developer Gunfire Games is celebrating today's release date news with a DLC teaser trailer.


The Awakened King features a brand-new storyline focusing on the One True King, a being corrupted by the Root during his near-death slumber and now out for revenge. It's up to players to uncover the king's secrets by exploring a new area of Losomn - the announcement makes mention of a castle overlooking a Dran coastal town, but doesn't explicitly confirm that this is where the DLC is set - containing new dungeons and "unexpected allies".


There's also talk of powerful new weapons and equipment for players to acquire - including new modifications, amulets, and rings - plus fearsome new enemies and bosses, risen from the depths of the ocean and now swarming the streets. And finally, there's the new Ritualist archetype, which can leverage status effects to punish foes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Rovio has said it is now blocking a "disturbing" pro-Israel ad featuring graphic content after a Reuters report highlighted its discovery in Angry Birds and a number of other family orientated games.


According to Reuters, the pro-Israel ad - created by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of an "advocacy drive" amid the continuing Israel-Hamas war - featured images of Hamas militants, rocket attacks, terrified Israeli families, explosions, and blurred graphic footage, culminating in the message, "We will make sure that those who harm us pay a heavy price."


Speaking to Reuters, an Israeli government official confirmed the ads were part of a $1.5m USD campaign but insisted advertisers had been instructed to block the advert "for people under 18". Despite these instructions, Reuters said it had documented six cases – in Britain, France, Austria, Germany, and Holland – where the adverts had been served in games for children or families.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has announced it'll finally be introducing a number of much-requested graphics features to Starfield on PC next week - including its long-awaited Nvidia DLSS support - with all additions initially arriving as a Steam Beta update prior to general release.


PC players have aired their frustration with Starfield's lack of DLSS support since before launch (its absence was initially believed to be the result of Bethesda's partnership with AMD, although AMD insisted otherwise), and it wasn't until September - one week after the game's arrival - that Bethesda finally committed to adding it in a future update.


At the time, the developer also pledged to introduce 32:9 ultrawide monitor support, a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, plus brightness and contrast controls; some of those features have already been implemented in previous updates, and at least a few more of the remaining ones will make it into next week's update alongside DLSS support.

Starting with the free stuff, Dreamlight Valley's next content update launches 5th December to coincide with its full release, bringing the "biggest amount of fixes and improvements so far", alongside the addition of The Nightmare Before Christmas' Jack Skellington as a new villager with his own friendship quests and rewards.


More significantly, it'll introduce the multiplayer ValleyVerse feature, enabling friends to visit each other's villages - where, alongside the usual activities, they'll be able exchange items, visit Scrooge McDuck's store (to take advantage of different stock), and more. Gameloft says it'll be building on this initial multiplayer offering over time.

The Day Before had been slated to arrive next week, on 10th November, following a rollercoaster ride to release in which Fntastic was forced to deny the game was simply a scam, and fight off a bizarre trademark dispute over the game's name - which was contested by a calendar app.


Now, a fresh statement by Fntastic released this evening states The Day Before will arrive later than planned (again) and under the banner of Early Access. "This is our first huge game, and there may be unforeseen consequences," Fntastic wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

Make It or Break It, as the new update is known, introduces a new Playgrounds mode where players can either muck around with the backyard featured in the story campaign or create one from the ground up, using an empty sandbox as a starting point.


Make It or Break It's suite of tools promises a considerable amount of creative freedom. Players can craft buildings and fill them with furniture, place obstacles, spawn creatures and bosses, even trigger ambient sounds and music. Obsidian says the majority of the campaign's assets - including art props, gameplay items, and harvestables, right down to individual blades of grass - will available for use, with no limit on the number of objects that can be placed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill: Ascension aired its first episode yesterday, but players are lambasting the game for its monetisation options and overwhelming UI.
Despite my personal apprehensions about Ascension, I thought I would keep an open mind about it. This morning, when I read discussions within the Silent Hill community on the game, I couldn't quite believe what fans were reporting until I tried the game for myself.
Despite developer Genvid claiming players can get involved for free, there's a pay-to-win model (as much as an interactive livestream can be pay-to-win) implemented here. A £20/$20 Founder's Pack will get you the season pass (which is also priced at £20/$20 as listed on the game's Apple App Store page), unlock all puzzles in the game, and exclusive emotes with throwbacks to older Silent Hill references. And an exclusive emote which says "It's trauma!" in rainbow colouring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new voice of Wario - or at least, the person behind his grumpy moustachioed mouth in WarioWare: Move It! - looks to be Kevin Afghani, the actor also cast as the new voices of both Mario and Luigi.


It's not a huge surprise to see Aghani taking on Wario as well, as this role was one of the four major Mario voices all performed by the legendary Charles Martinet, alongside Mario, Luigi and Waluigi. 


Afghani's role as Wario looks to be confirmed within the WarioWare: Move It! credits, where he's listed as the game's principal performer. (In a typically oddball touch, we can also see his favourite food listed alongside his name: it's sushi).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has discussed the possibility of a fourth game in the series, and the idea of developing it as a more approachable prequel, similar to Yakuza 0.

Shenmue 3 was released in 2019, 18 years after the second game, but was aimed predominantly at fans of the series who backed the project on Kickstarter.


"I want Shenmue 4 to be enjoyable for newcomers,"  Suzuki said now, in an interview with IGN. "To make that possible, the most important thing is to make it enjoyable without knowing previous events in the story. I don't think that a new player wants to know 100 percent of the story. 20 or 30 percent could be enough.

Because of the shortened season length - believed to last only until the start of December - the game's next battle pass will feature just 50 levels (half of the normal 100), leaks have revealed. 


The battle pass will be filled with character skins that are mash-ups of previous Fortnite favourites, such as Peely the banana man mixed up with ice cream mascot Lil' Whip - for a new skin named Lil' Split.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom says mods for its PC games can cause "reputational damage" thanks to content which causes offence to "public order and morals", resulting in a blow to the games' (and presumably the company's) images.

The statement was made during a recent presentation uploaded to Capcom's research and development YouTube channel on anti-cheat and anti-piracy measures and how Capcom is tackling them in-house.

"Mods are popular with users because they allow them to add or change various features to an existing game," Capcom said, admitting the "majority of mods can have a positive impact". But some mods are seen as "detrimental" by the company in terms of "reputational damage" and workload.

As per The Chinese Room's latest developer stream, Phyre is a somewhat pre-defined Elder vampire recently awoken after a 100-year slumber and slightly bewildered by modern-day Seattle. Phyre, for reasons initially unknown, carries a mysterious brand on their hand which is somehow connected to a voice in their head - belonging to a modern vampire known as Fabien - who's bound to them, serving as an ever-present companion as the adventure continues.


While Phyre's loose backstory might already be in place, there's some flexibility as to how they present in-game, with players able to choose their gender, clothing, and clan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rollerdrome, the acclaimed (and ridiculously stylish) skater shooter from OlliOlli developer Roll7, is launching for Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on 28th November.


Rollerdrome, which debuted on PC and PlayStation toward the end of last year, is set in the far-flung future of seven years from now, where, in a world ruled by corporations, the public is kept placated by a brutal blood sport known, as, yes, Rollerdrome.


Thrust into this dystopian set-up, players, in the role of Kara Hasson, don rollerskates and raise weapons - specifically, dual pistols, a grenade launcher, shotgun, and eventually, a laser-crossbow - for some high-speed third-person shooting action, where performing tricks restores ammo and bullet-time-style slo-mo can be deployed for greater success against opponents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday's layoffs at Destiny 2 developer Bungie reportedly impacted 100 employees - approximately 8% of its 1,200-strong workforce - and occurred just weeks after management warned staff that revenue for the year was running significantly below expectations.


That's according to Bloomberg, which reports Bungie employees were issued "dire management warnings" that revenue was 45 percent below projections just two weeks ago. The slump is said to be the result of a "sharp drop" in the popularity of Destiny 2, with Bungie CEO Pete Parsons having reportedly highlighted weak player retention at the time.


In that same meeting, according to Bloomberg sources in attendance, Parsons told employees that Destiny 2's next expansion, The Final Shape - which concludes the game's current Light and Darkness saga - was only getting "good" rather than "great" feedback. As such, management was planning to delay its release to improve the product.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has entered into an agreement to acquire Digital Eclipse, the retro-focused studio behind the likes of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration and this year's The Making of Karateka.


Digital Eclipse has existed in a number of forms since its founding in 1992. In its original guise, it specialised in porting arcade games over to the likes of Game Boy Colour and PlayStation; that emulation work has continued in the years since despite organisational changes, first as it become Backbone Entertainment following a merger in 2003, and again after the Digital Eclipse brand was purchased and revived by former employees in 2015.


In more recent times, the studio's emulation work has included the Blizzard Arcade Collection, Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, but last year's interactive digital documentary Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration - which blended new video interviews, archival material, and playable games to form an exhaustive record of Atari's history - was particularly well-recieved. The studio then launched its Gold Master Series earlier this year, taking a similarly thorough approach to individual classic games, starting with the acclaimed The Making of Karateka.

"Decommissioning the online services for older games is something we do not take lightly," the publisher wrote in a post on its support site. "however, it is also a necessity as the technology behind these services becomes outdated."


In total, 10 games will see their online services yanked as of 25th January next year. On PC, Assassin's Creed Revelations, Ghost Recon Future Solider, Heroes of Might and Magic 4, NCSI, RUSE, and Trials Evolution will all be affected. Online services will also be decommissioned for Assassin's Creed 2 and Spinter Cell: Conviction on Xbox 360, Assassin's Creed Liberation HD (Xbox 360 and PS3), plus Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (Mac).

According to a report by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, citing "people with knowledge of the matter", Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion - which is set to conclude the game's Light and Darkness saga - will now launch in June next year. Bungie publicly announced a 27th February 2024 launch for the expansion back in August.


As for Marathon - a PvP reimagining of Bungie's classic 90s FPS series, which was revealed in May - that has yet to be given an official release date. However, Bloomberg says this has now been moved into 2025, suggesting the studio was previously targeting a launch next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Nightmares 3 might still be some way off - it's due to arrive in 2024 - but, in the spirit of this spookiest of seasons, Bandai Namco has shared 18 minutes of co-op gameplay.


Announced back in August, Little Nightmares 3 marks the first time a mainline entry in the series won't be handled by original developer Tarsier Studios. Instead, Supermassive Games - the team behind The Dark Pictures Anthology and Until Dawn - is at the helm, taking players on an adventure following two new protagonists.


Our spooky new pals are Low and Alone, both trapped in a world known as the Spiral - a "cluster of disturbing places" that includes the sandy Necropolis, home to a monolithic (and far from friendly) creature known as Monster Baby. An extensive look at the Necropolis and its perils can be found in the new gameplay trailer below.

The live-action adaptation of Scott Cawthon's video game series, which stars The Hunger Games' Josh Hutcherson as troubled security Mike Schmidt, made its box office debut last week and has earned $78m in North America and $130m globally since then. 


As noted by Variety, this makes the movie the second-largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation in the US, coming only behind that of Nintendo and Illumination's animated Super Mario Bros. Movie, which made $146.3 million.

This filing was made in November of last year, but was made public earlier this month. As shared on World Intellectual Property Organisation (via ResetEra), images of this device show a handheld apparatus, not too dissimilar to that of a Nintendo 3DS. Unlike the 3DS, however, this device can be split in half to allow for wireless gaming between two players.


It appears to be a handheld machine only, with no hybrid capabilities. Additionally, the top screen can face out. This is even when the device is closed. I can only assume if this product was to ever be realised, Nintendo would advise we all get some kind of case to go with it to protect the screens

In an interview with PC Gamer, the Counter-Strike 2 dev team – seemingly responding as a team and not as individual developers – said that whilst it had worked hard to ensure CS:GO players could transfer their skins and cosmetics into CS2, it "didn't know enough" about NFTs to contribute meaningfully to the web3 debate and claims that players could transfer their NFT cosmetics in the same way.

"From the start of development, we knew that CS2 would ultimately replace CS:GO, and we wanted to ensure that players could keep as many of their CS:GO skills and items as possible," the CS2 dev team said. "So, early into the process, we started the work to support all of the CS:GO weapons, stickers, agents, and music in CS2.

In an interview with GQ magazine, Lake admitted that whilst the development of cult horror game Alan Wake was difficult in the shadows of Max Payne – "the curse of the second album", as Lake describes it – there are still other worlds outside of Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Control he would like to entertain us with. 

"Would I ever do anything else?" he asks. "Yeah. I'm still thinking that I will. There will be a time when I retire. It's just that… this has all been so engaging."

The comments come after Wizards of the Coast recently revealed what new crossover expansions Magic: The Gathering fans can expect to see next year, including new sets based upon Final Fantasy, Fallout, and the Assassin's Creed series.

Back in 2018, Rosewater was asked if WotC would ever "consider licensing a different IP and creating different cards for it". In response, he said that the team thought it was "important that Magic is one cohesive game and not a hodge podge of different things".

That's according to an interview Beaver gave with the CaptainBribo podcast, in which he said that while he would "keep the lore beat it's predicated on", and "keep the lore you find out", he would "have Ellie there but in a different relationship [with Isaac] and redo the entire main story".

As transcribed by PCGN, Beaver talks with Bribo about how, if able to rewrite the third instalment of the terrifying sci-fi horror series, he would ensure the story focussed more tightly on protagonist Isaac Clarke, albeit retaining the co-op mechanic to illustrate how the two characters see the same things differently.

Square Enix producer and director, Yosuke Saito, took to Twitter/X yesterday to say they'd had a "fun recording session" at work, teasing that they'd tell us more once the news had been finalised and approved by the appropriate channels.

So far, so what, right? Well, the tweet was accompanied by a photo of Saito's script, and whilst they'd obscured two blocks of text on the front page to hide the subject matter, a little of the text behind the front page was legible for those who can read Japanese… and it's a name hidden in plain sight that has made Dragon Quest fans very, very excited.

Players can pick up the gruesome jack-o-lantern animation for the princely sum of 1200 Dragon Krystals, a premium in-game currency that sports a current exchange rate of 1250 krystals for $10 USD.

To put that into context, Mortal Kombat 11's Kombat Pack, whilst the preceding title in the series, featured several full DLC characters for just $20. But Mortal Kombat 1 wants the equivalent of $10 for that one fatality, even though it's a premium game that costs at best £60 – or £85 if you forked out for the premium edition.

The Outlast Trials is out now in early access on both Steam and Epic Games Store. Set in the height of the Cold War era, players take on the role of test subjects abducted by the shady Murkoff Corporation, where they'll be "thrust into a series of physical and mental ordeals, tormented by iconic characters, and challenged alone or in teams to survive with their sanity intact".

Cartman – played by Janeisha Adams-Ginyard, just to sprinkle in a little extra confusion – asks, "do save games not cross multiple universes?", to which Stan confirms: "Save games don't even cross between PCs and PS5s – why would they cross between multiple universes?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With just over a week to go until this year's BlizzCon - the show's first in-person event since 2019 - Blizzard has shared a full broadcast schedule detailing everything that'll be available to watch online as the two-day convention unfolds.


This year's BlizzCon, which is being held at California's Anaheim Convention Center, runs from Saturday, 3rd November to Sunday, 4th November; all panels due to take place at the BlizzCon Arena during that time will be streamed in their entirety via YouTube and Twitch for the benefit of fans unable to attend in-person.


In total, 11 panels will be broadcast over the course of the two-day event, with the most tantalising - aside from BlizzCon's Opening Ceremony, which usually manages to pack in reveal or two (not always a good one, admittedly) - being the four offering a look at "what's next".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free-to-play battle royale shooter Apex Legends is finally introducing cross-progression as part of its 19th season, and ahead of its arrival next Tuesday, 31st October, developer Respawn Entertainment has detailed how the whole thing'll work.


Cross-progression, once launched, will enable players to access their progression data, cosmetics, and currency via a single EA account across all platforms. Crucially, the cross-progression migration process is both automatic and mandatory, meaning there's a fair amount those who play across multiple platforms will likely want to know in preparation.


For starters, players who've accrued different progress levels across multiple platforms will soon have all that smushed together into a single account. Respawn will generate the stats of this new account based on what it's calling a player's "primarily platform" - that is, the one with the highest level reached across all platforms. Stats/progress of all other accounts will be lost.

<blockquote><p>A squid ship is a bustling, bright, messy place. The scene on deck looks like a mechanic&#8217;s garage where an oil change has gone terribly wrong. Scores of fishing lines extend into the water, each bearing specialized hooks operated by automated reels. When they pull a squid on board, it squirts warm, viscous ink, which coats the walls and floors. Deep-sea squid have high levels of ammonia, which they use for buoyancy, and a smell hangs in the air. The hardest labor generally happens at night, from 5 P.M. until 7 A.M. Hundreds of bowling-ball-size light bulbs hang on racks on both sides of the vessel, enticing the squid up from the depths. The blinding glow of the bulbs, visible more than a hundred miles away, makes the surrounding blackness feel otherworldly...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arizona Sunshine 2, the sequel to developer Vertigo Games' well-received 2016 VR zombie shooter, is coming to PlayStation VR 2, Meta Quest, and Steam VR on 7th December - and there's a new gameplay trailer to accompany the news.


Vertigo's sequel brings back the original game's wise-cracking protagonist for another bout of sun-kissed (and optionally co-operative) zombie-slaying shooting action in the Arizona desert. This time, however, it's promising to mix things up with the likes of enhanced "next-gen VR environments" and a "new mutilation and gore system". And if you can't make zombies' eyes pop out by kicking them up the arse, I'm sending it back.


There's also talk of "all-new and fan-favourite" weapons - including the likes of shotguns, flamethrowers, crowbars, pickaxes, and machetes - but the absolute most critical new addition is Buddy. Yes, this time around, you get to mow down the zombies hordes alongside your own pet dog pal. And he's not just there for the violence; described as the "goodest boy to play a game of undead fetch with", he'll also unearth key items and help carry gear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities: Skylines 2 has got off to a bit of a rough, with many players complaining of performance issues following this week's launch on PC. But while publisher Paradox has been forthright in acknowledging these problems (even prior to launch, somewhat unconventionally), it now wants to make it absolutely clear that, no, technical issues aren't because the game is trying to render the teeth of every single person in your city.


All this apparently started with a post on the Cities: Skylines subreddit in which one Hexcoder0 claimed the game was rendering individual teeth with no LOD (level of detail) adjustments, even when viewed from far away. They even threw together a bit of a collage feature a screenshot, a couple of character meshes, and, vitally, two red circles, to illustrate their claim.

 
Two days later, Paradox - presumably in some kind of damage limitation frenzy given the not exactly glittering reception the game has received - has responded by firing a statement out to press drawing attention to the "bizarre story" and denying Molargate is true.

Developer Gameloft revealed today that its game would leave early access on 5th December but retain its early access price point (and indeed, it will also get pricier physical and special digital editions with extra currency and cosmetics bundled in).


On top of that, there's word of a major new expansion to the game, which will also come with a $30 price tag. Disney Dreamlight Valley: A Rift In Time will introduce new biomes and yet more characters to the base game, and is set to be fully detailed in a video showcase to be broadcast next Wednesday, 1st November at 5pm UK time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 is out today, and Remedy has now detailed two expansions set to continue its story in 2024.


The first is named Night Springs, which Alan Wake fans will know is the name of the series' in-game TV show (based heavily on The Twilight Zone). 


"Visions and dreams," Remedy teases of what fans should expect here. "Fiction is written and coming true. Fiction collapses and remains just words on a page. These are those stories... in Night Springs."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has said it expects one of its best seasons ever for console sales this Christmas, as PlayStation 5 stock is now in "full supply" for the first time since the PS5 launched in November 2020.
PlayStation's rosy outlook is also boosted by the release of Marvel's Spider-Man 2, PlayStation exec Eric Lempel told Barron's (via ResetEra).
Lempel said Sony had been hampered by supply chain issues caused by the Covid pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which in turn caused a components shortage for PS5 production.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So you thought developer Rocksteady was done with Batman: Arkham Knight, did you? Well, it seems that might not be quite the case. Eight years after its initial release, Rocksteady's third entry in the Arkham series has been updated to add an unexpected bit of new content - but it appears the celebrations might have been a bit premature.


Earlier today, Batman fans began reporting the Epic Games Store version of 2015's Batman: Arkham Knight had received an update specifically adding Robert Pattinson's Batsuit, from last year's movie reboot, as a wearable skin.


It was a bit of an odd discovery for all sorts of reasons, not least because neither Rocksteady nor publisher Warner Bros. announced or acknowledged its arrival. The Pattsuit's apparent Epic Games Store exclusivity also seemed like a bit of a strange choice too, and the mystery only deepened when the suit reportedly vanished not long after word of its release began to spread.

SteamVR 2.0 was confirmed to be in the works all the way back in 2019, but it wasn't until its surprise re-emergence last month that it started finding its way into users' hands - initially as part of a short beta designed to iron out any major wrinkles ahead of a general release.


And that official launch has now arrived, with the update bringing the likes of an overhauled VR storefront that'll make new and popular VR games easier to find, alongside the majority of features introduced as part of Steam's Steam-Deck-inspired Big Picture redesign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has started rolling out October's Xbox system update to all users, with this latest release introducing the previously announced ability to remap keyboard keys to Xbox controller buttons, alongside a number of other features.


Microsoft confirmed the new accessibility feature was undergoing Insider testing earlier this month, explaining its introduction would enable users to remap almost 90 keyboard keys - or combinations of keys - to any button on the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2. This would, for instance, make it possible for players with limited mobility to use the Xbox Adaptive Controller with games ordinarily only supporting mouse/keyboard.


Keyboard mapping for Xbox controllers will be available through the Xbox Accessories app on PC and console once October's update has been installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its latest earnings report - for the first half of its fiscal year 2023-24 - Ubisoft has announced yet another delay for Skull and Bones, with the beleaguered pirate adventure now expected to arrive sometime in the first few months of 2024.


Skull and Bones has been in development since 2013, but the game has seen repeated delays following its official unveiling in 2017. Most recently, Ubisoft shifted the game's release from this March to an unspecified "early" point in its fiscal year 2023-24 in order to create a "much more polished and balanced experience and to build awareness".


Skull and Bones has received a closed beta since then, but word on a revised release date has remained conspicuously absent - and Ubisoft has now announced a delay into Q4 of its current financial year, meaning it's expected to arrive sometime within the January-March 2024 period. No reason was provided for this latest delay.

Tomorrow's Alan Wake 2 got a final airing and it looks just as creepy as we'd have hoped. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth has an Animal Crossing mode, and Liv in particular is delighted. Oh and Still Wakes The Deep - the spooky game from Everybody's Gone To The Rapture set on a Scottish oil rig, looks great. 
Opinion is a little more mixed on Metal Gear Solid Green Triangle: Snake Eater, with the visual style critiqued by some quarters of the internet today. Joining me to discuss the rest are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

The crossover was initially teased last month, when FuturLab co-CEO Kirsty Rigden called Back to the Future a "dream IP" for the developer.
Players will get to scrub up iconic vehicles and buildings from the film series, including the Time Machine, Doc's van, Hill Valley Clock Tower, the Holomax Theatre, and Doc's Time Train.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends: Ignite, the 19th season of the ever-popular battle royale, will explode onto our screens with the brand new Legend Conduit next Tuesday, 31st October. The massive in-game storm at Storm Point has now cleared the map and things look a little different to how we remember it, meaning there's plenty of new areas to explore as you fight to survive.
First off, let's talk about brand new Legend Conduit. We now know more about her abilities, as well as how she came to get her equipment and suit. Conduit began as a fan of Apex Legends and is now stoked to be part of the Apex Games themselves - but she didn't join just for fame or fun, as she's got a family to take care of. She's described as having a good sense of humour and being fascinated with the tech used in the games.
An interesting fact for any Titanfall fans is that Conduit uses a radioactive battery from a modified Monarch Titan to power her suit and gadgets. She went exploring on a highly-radiated battlefield and came across the battery. She then stole it and uses it to take her place in the Apex Games - but at a cost. The battery itself is poisoning Conduit, and though we're not sure how this will impact her story as we move ahead, we're a bit worried about her long-term chances.

One major mobile game publisher is said to have met with Unity's John Riccitiello after the policy announcement and said: "Fuck you, we're not paying".


The report comes from MobileGamer.Biz, with anonymous sources from inside Unity providing fresh details.

The new difficulty is named Nightmare, which I can only imagine will be incredibly challenging. When I got to play some of Alan Wake 2 earlier this year I explored two chapters on Normal mode and I died a lot. And then I died again.


On the plus side, players will still have all their previously unlocked weapons and upgrades to hand when they return to the game, as this is all retained in Alan Wake 2's New Game Plus.

The remake - Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater to use its official name - is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and this new trailer showed Snake sneaking around a beautifully lit jungle and a cute little frog paddling through some very realistic water.


It's technically impressive, but for some fans it's lost the art style of the original game.

Dondoko Island will let players escape to a deserted island off the coast of Hawaii, a "vacation within a vacation, where a cosy DIY lifestyle awaits". There's fishing, material gathering, furniture crafting, and even decora- hold on...


RGG Studio has essentially added Animal Crossing into the Like a Dragon (previously called Yakuza) series, but with the usual exaggerated wackiness the franchise has become known for. And I could not be more excited for it.

In addition, it's believed the Kurast region from Diablo 2 will also be added - a city that fell to Mephisto's corruption.

As is its general "patching process" for Payday 3, with the developer saying the goal is to ensure future game updates will be released "at a steady cadence".

Regardless, it's a positive sign things have gone well for Elephant Mario and his warp pipe-stuffing chums - even if Nintendo's mascot couldn't quite beat Spider-Man 2 in the UK's boxed game chart on Monday.

Tonight's latest instalment was a pretty decent offering all-round, that, while perhaps not exciting as such, did at least have some interesting reveals. There was first footage of Konami's Metal Gear Sold 3 remake, a new game from PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab, and more. And if you're looking for a summary of it all that won't take up 30 minutes of your time, then read on.


First up, we learned Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will continue the series' tradition of extravagant side activities when it releases on 26th January next year, giving players the opportunity to manage an entire tropical island resort in pure Animal Crossing fashion. There's fishing, bug catching, crafting, and a whole lot more as detailed in the trailer below.


PowerWash simulator developer FuturLab unveiled its new game Ikaro: Will Not Die, a  spiritual successor to the studio's acclaimed Velocity series that promises "satisfying flow-state" rogue-lite action that you can read more about elsewhere.

Well, would you believe it, there's a game just for you; it's called Still Wakes the Deep and first gameplay has just debuted.


Announced back in June, Still Wakes the Deep is the latest from developer The Chinese Room - previously responsible for the likes of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Dear Esther - whisking players to the Beira D oil rig off the Scottish coast circa 1975.


What follows is a narrative-focused first-person horror adventure in which players, in the role of an off-shore oil rig worker suddenly cut off from the outside world, must "run, climb, and swim through the flooding corridors and storm-lashed outer decks" as they attempt to evade an unspeakable otherworldly forces that's invited itself onboard.

Velocity, for the uninitiated, began life as twitchy shoot-'em-up in which players piloted their ship (known as the Quarp Jet) through space in a blaze of enemy-shredded bullets. Its sequel, 2014's Velocity 2X, retained the acclaimed ship-bound action of the original, but paired it with regular on-foot sections requiring protagonist to Lieutenant Kai Tana to disembark and solve a few puzzles to clear the way forward. Eurogamer liked it a lot!


But back to Ikaro: Will Not Die; it's being billed as an action-adventure rogue-lite, that "brings the pace and precision of [the Velocity series'] satisfying flow-state action into third-person, while infusing an array of exciting new systems and mechanics."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ark: Survival Ascended - the Unreal Engine 5 remake of dino-survival hit Ark: Survival Evolved - is surprise-launching onto PC today, 25th October. However, developer Wildcard has announced a further delay for the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions, with both now due to arrive some time in November.


There has, of course, been a fair bit of controversy surrounding Ark: Survival Ascended since its announcement back in April this year; its reveal came with the news that Wildcard would be taking Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers offline when the remake arrived, forcing players to upgrade to the new version if they wanted to stay put. 


It didn't help, either, that the remake was initially only available as part of a bundle with the now-delayed Ark 2, and while Wildcard eventually scrapped those plans, it instead decided to release a standalone version of Ark: Survival Ascended that was - amazingly - exactly the same price as the original bundle, despite featuring one less game. However, that price recently fell by $5 to $44.99 after Wildcard reversed plans to include a remake of Ark's Scorched Earth expansion alongside the base map, which it said would no longer be ready for launch.

Announced back in May, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater (as the remake is officially known) retains 2004 original's story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear - as well as its voice cast.


Beyond that, Konami is promising a variety of modern-day upgrades, including improved visuals - the remake is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 - as well as evolved gameplay and a "seamless user experience", whatever that means.

Today we are releasing ingress2gateway, a tool

Background
In the ever-evolving world of Kubernetes, networking plays a pivotal role. As more applications are
deployed in Kubernetes clusters, effective exposure of these services to clients becomes a critical
concern. If you've been working with Kubernetes, you're likely familiar with the Ingress API,
which has been the go-to solution for managing external access to services.
The Ingress API provides a way to route external traffic to your applications within the cluster,
making it an indispensable tool for many Kub…]]></summary>

And if your nerves are up to the challenge, the Halloween Update launches today.


Frictional's creative lead Fredrik Olsson began teasing a hardcore Shell Shock mode last month, detailing a few of the sadistic features it would bring, but with it now here as part of today's Halloween Update, the studio has provided a little more information on what's in store.


For starters, as previously confirmed, The Bunker's Admin Office will no longer be the safe haven it once was in Shell Shock mode; its reassuringly sturdy steel doors are replaced with wood, meaning, yes, the monster can get in. And speaking of that pursuing horror, Shell Shock mode gives it new behaviours designed to increase its unpredictability.

While it's not quite the Detective Pikachu film sequel we and lead actor Justice Smith may be hoping for, it's a cute, six-minute video full of detective clichés and adorable Pokémon.
Detective Pikachu begins his daily routine with a strong cup of coffee and a flick through the morning paper, filming his activities for his social media presence (even Pikachu isn't immune to becoming an influencer, I guess). Tim joins him for breakfast, only to find his flan has been taken from the fridge, so the pair get to work to figure out who took it. You can watch the video on YouTube to see who-dun-it.

Publisher Paradox Interactive previously admitted the game had "not achieved the [performance] benchmark" it wanted. Despite that, the sequel reached a concurrent peak of 104,697 players, surpassing the original's record of 60,386 concurrent players (as recorded by SteamDB).
Steam reviews for Cities: Skylines 2 are mixed however, mostly with criticisms levelled at the game's performance and some players are questioning Paradox's decision to release the game even if it believes "releasing now is the best way forward".

"According to legend, when friends and family gathered around a Nintendo 64 system to compete in Mario PartyTM 3, fun times were bound to follow," the trailer teases. Fun times yes, but I am also sure there were some swiftly disconnected controllers in my house as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One month after launch, Payday 3's PC player count has dropped to around 10 times less than that of its predecessor, Payday 2.
Payday 3's released was marred by server issues which left players unable to access the game during its launch weekend, something which developer Starbreeze blamed on a third-party matchmaking service.
While these issues have been resolved, players are still finding other problems with the game technically, and with its UI, progression, and its always-online requirement. Many Payday 3 Steam reviews compare the game to 2013's Payday 2, calling 2 a superior experience and suggesting others are better off playing that instead. Which is exactly what Payday fans look to be doing.

The game uses the Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) System to identify when cheats or hacks are being used and will issue an immediate ban for bot-like behaviour.


That includes spinning around too quickly, which is all to do with your DPI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda and Todd Howard announced Elder Scrolls 6 when they did because of fan demand, or in the words of Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith, because "the pitchforks and torches were out".


Nesmith, who has been part of Bethesda Softworks on and briefly off since the 90s and has worked on Skyrim, the Fallout series and Starfield, said the studio took "years of hits for not talking about Elder Scrolls 6" publicly. 


"I mean, years of hits," Nesmith said in an interview with MinnMax. "Because Todd's opinion - one which I share, by the way - is that the video game industry has short memories. Those companies that start touting their games years ahead of time, actually, you know, they screw themselves. The best time to start talking about it is six months before release." This was the strategy the studio implemented for Fallout 4.

Fans were left disappointed by the base game only offering 720p resolution on PC for these games - following earlier confusion in which Konami initially stated all games would "target" 1080p on all platforms other than Nintendo Switch. 


In response, a fan has speedily released the MGSResolutionPatch PC mod, just hours after the game launched on Steam (thanks, PC Gamer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has detailed its earnings for the first quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, pointing to a record-breaking Q1 for Xbox gaming revenue, despite a 7% drop in hardware sales.


Over the course of Microsoft's Q1 2024, which covers 1st July to 30th September, Xbox generated $3.9bn USD in gaming revenue - equating to a 9% year-on-year increase - which the company attributed to strong performance from first-party titles and Game Pass.


Not coincidentally, Xbox's record-breaking Q1 encompassed the long-awaited launch of Bethesda's Starfield, which surpassed 10m players within its first few weeks of release - and in an investor call following today's fiscal report, Microsoft CEO Satyda Nadella confirmed the game provided a significant boost for Game Pass, setting the record at launch for the "most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever" (as per The Verge's Tom Warren).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive has published some very, very good games since its formation in 2016, and 12 of those titles will soon be bundled onto a single Switch cartridge. The only catch - and it's admittedly quite a big one - is that it'll cost a whopping $200.


The region-free Annapurna Interactive Deluxe Limited Edition Collection, as the mega-priced cartridge is officially known, is being released in collaboration with video game collectibles company iam8bit and - as per the "limited edition" bit - is restricted to 2,500 copies.


For your hard-earned $199.99 USD (plus, of course, a hefty chunk of VAT and import fees if you're ordering from the UK), you'll get a cartridge containing Donut County, Gorogoa, Hindsight, I Am Dead, If Found..., Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition, Neon White, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Solar Ash, The Artful Escape, The Pathless, and What Remains of Edith Finch. That is, then, some top-notch gaming in a single square inch (or thereabouts) of plastic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released strict new guidelines for the smaller-scale competitive tournament scene, outlining exactly what it will permit - with caps on everything from competitor numbers to ticket prices - before organisers must apply for an official license from the company.


As detailed in its new Community Tournament Guidelines - which were initially published by Nintendo of Japan before appearing in locally adjusted form on Nintendo of Europe's website earlier today - tournaments will be permitted to continue without a license after 15th November this year, provided they are "small-scale and not for commercial profit".


More specifically, these strictly limited events - which Nintendo is terming "community tournaments" - may not have more than 200 participants a day when held in-person, increasing to 300 daily participants for online tournaments. Additionally, money raised through spectator tickets and entry fees, capped at £18/€20 and £14/€15 a person respectively, must not exceed the costs of organising the tournament and raising prize money - although prize money (limited to a total of £4,500/€5,000) also cannot be generated from spectator ticket sales.

Announced back in August, the Star Wars: Dark Forces remaster is being made in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, and sees the 1995 first-person shooter - which follows mercenary Kyle Katarn as he undertakes a number of covert operations to thwart the Empire at the behest of the Rebel Alliance - getting a welcome modern-day upgrade.


Nightdive Studios - the remaster specialist behind this year's acclaimed System Shock update, among many others - is promising resolutions of up to 4K at 120fps for its enhanced Dark Forces release, although expect that to vary depending on your platform of choice.

That means streaming simultaneously on Twitch as well as competitor platforms like YouTube and Kick.


It's a move that will help streamers grow their viewership both on and off the platform, even while Twitch develops further tools to aid with growth like the recent Discovery Feed and Stories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 launches today, and fans have already found references to the games they expect to be featured in Konami's still-to-be-announced Vol 2. 


As a reminder, this initial collection is centred around MGS1, 2 and 3. But back in June,  Konami's website appeared to suggest a future Vol 2 would continue by including MGS4, 5 and Peace Walker.


Now Vol 1 is released, that's exactly what the game's own files also suggest - via references to all three of those games spotted in its code by fans on reddit. Konami is yet to confirm Vol 2, of course, but its contents now seem fairly certain. (Sorry, Twin Snakes fans.)

If you've not heard of Suika already, think of it a casual game which plays a bit like 2048 or Threes. Instead of numbers, however, you combine round fruits within a set amount of space. The aim is to make a massive watermelon (which is pronounced suika in Japanese).
The game was first released in Japan on Switch in December 2021 and has since sold over 2m copies. There's also a free browser version you can try.

Yes, I'm one of those Fallout: New Vegas fans who wishes we could get a shinier, updated version of the game. And I'm one step closer to that dream thanks to bololo11's FNV to FO4 mod.
The script can convert most models and plugins from both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, as well as the base game of New Vegas, from their native game engine of Gamebryo. bololo11 states the mod can't convert NPCs and creatures, quests or scripts "yet", and converted weapons and armour can't be equipped, but it's a great start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A drink driving game which was available on the Nintendo Switch eShop has been pulled from sale, after it initially used a PEGI 3+ rating.

Need for Spirit Drink & Drive Simulator was released for the Switch on 15th October, and contains gameplay of a "hapless professional driver tasked with delivering alcoholic beverages to various celebrations, all while battling the perils of abysmal roads and your very own addiction to the booze you're transporting".

With "immersive camera modes" and an added "exciting twist" of drunk vision, the game is (yes) a drink driving simulator. Its PEGI 3+ rating suggests the game is suitable for all age groups. PEGI however states a game which "refers to or depicts the use of illegal drugs, alcohol or tobacco" must be labelled as PEGI 16 or PEGI 18.

As reported back in June, players have been seeking a secret cow level in the game, something that began as an urban myth in the original Diablo but was acknowledged by Blizzard in later games.


Blizzard has so far denied the existence of a cow level in Diablo 4, with general manager Rod Fergusson telling Kinda Funny the development team "wanted to ground [Diablo 4] as much as possible". That hasn't stopped players searching for it, however.

If you were a fan of the old show, I would be delighted if you would subscribe.
Back in August, we welcomed the release of Kubernetes 1.28. That release was led by Grace Nguyen, a CS student at the University of Waterloo. Grace joined me for the traditional release interview, and while you can read her story below, I encourage you to listen to it if you can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've somehow missed out on developer Dennaton Games' classic Hotline Miami series - or are just looking for another excuse to revisit its woozily eccentric mayhem - you might like to know both games are now natively available for Xbox Series X/S and PS5.


It has, somewhat unbelievably, been over a decade since the critically lauded Hotline Miami first dropped jaws and quickened pulses with its breathless, blood-soaked top-down ode to violence, in which the game's unnamed protagonist rampages against the local Miami mafia after receiving cryptic instructions on his answering machine.


Its grisly blend of stealth and ultra-gory shooting action - augmented by a surreal narrative, a stylish fever-dream aesthetic, and an absolute stunner of a pulsing synth soundtrack - immediately won it fans (Eurogamer awarded it 10/10 at the time of its release). 2015's Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number went bigger, weirder, and tougher in almost every conceievable way, but didn't have quite the same impact the second time around.

Last week, Skull Island: Rise of Kong released on PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and Xbox with little marketing fanfare, but garnered attention for its poor quality, especially for a game for a licensed franchise.


In a new report from The Verge, developers from IguanaBee say the game was made in one year from scratch and with very little funding.

In anticipation of our next lap around the sun, Awesome Games Done Quick has released its full schedule for 2024's charity speedrun event in January. Taking place between 14th and 21st January (both online and, in a change from recent years, also in person in Pittsburgh), the event features an extensive speedrunning schedule. This will include Peanut Butter the dog, who will be speedrunning the 1985 NES platformer Gyromite! What a Su-paw-star.


Other highlights from the upcoming invent include an Any% speedrun of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by gymnast86, a The Last of Us PS4 Any% speedrun and modded Hades speedrun that will see two players (arcalena and trash_lapras) using one controller and three weapons to get through the game.

That ginormous launch means Spider-Man 2 hit the 2.5m copies milestone faster than any God of War, Uncharted or The Last of Us. It's also faster to that total than Spider-Man 1.

Modder Matt Filer has given us exactly that, with a new mod he released earlier today. This also marks the first mod which swaps the Xenomorph out for something else, Filer says, which is quite surprising. Alien: Isolation seems like the perfect fodder for this kind of thing, but a quick scan on Nexus Mods shows indeed, there aren't any mods which do this already.
Filer has put a short but sweet paragraph into the mod's description: "This mod swaps the Xenomorph for Thomas the Tank Engine. I'm so sorry."

Speaking on Skill Up's Friends Per Second podcast, conversation with the developer turned to a "hypothetical" third main game in Insomniac's Spider-Man series. Inthar was understandably quiet for a good while, clearly not wanting to give too much of the studio's plans for the series away. 


However, after some careful deliberation, the developer said whatever could happen next would undoubtedly be "pretty epic".

Squadron 42 was originally announced for release in 2014, but has been delayed multiple times. A beta release was scheduled for mid-2020, before it too was delayed by three months. Later that year, CIG director Chris Roberts admitted the game was still a way off from a beta phase.
The recent update on Squadron 42 came during this year's CitizenCon, along with a development video - which you can watch further below.

Following the game's release last week, fans have been poring over its details. One such detail was the inclusion of a Cuban flag in Miles' house, as well as various Cuban flags in the surrounding area. However, Miles is not from Cuba. His mother, Rio Morales, is Puerto Rican, and while both flags are similar, the colours are different.


Many noticed this slip-up. Over the weekend, reddit user TheHouselessTurtle shared a screenshot from the game showing the Cuban flag inside Miles' home.

Insomniac's sequel is the fourth-biggest UK boxed game launch of 2023, behind EA Sports FC, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Hogwarts Legacy.

The patch notes, available on Steam, detail the post-game changes which will now no longer remove all vestiges (checkpoints). Instead, each iteration of New Game Plus will remove more vestiges until NG+3 when all will be removed for the biggest challenge.


In addition, players will have the option to continue their current game retaining character, items and progression but resetting the world to allow completionists to finish outstanding tasks. A customisable NG+ modifier system is also on the way so players can tweak the experience themselves.

In the recent Kubernetes v1.28 release, we (SIG Storage) introduced a new alpha feature that aims to improve PersistentVolume (PV)

With the addition of the lastPhaseTransitionTime field into the status of a PV,

EA confirmed over a year ago that it was developing a single-player third-person action adventure Iron Man game as part of a new collaboration between it and Marvel for "several" new projects. And just like the Dead Space remake - which was acclaimed by critics and players alike – Motive hopes to utilise a fan-based community council to keep it on the right track.

"I can't believe it's been over a year since my last update about our beloved Motive Studio," GM Patrick Klaus said by way of a statement posted to the official website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A dev build of Overkill's The Walking Dead has leaked online.

The build reportedly contains unreleased content from the lacklustre zombie shooter as well as content that made the final release back in 2018.
There is no way to purchase a legal copy of the game anymore as, just a year on from its 2018 release, Skybound revoked Starbreeze's The Walking Dead license and the beleaguered game was unceremoniously pulled from sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With reports increasingly pointing to a Switch 2 launch next year, Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has talked a little about the company's perspective on entering a new console generation, saying he believes its Nintendo Account system will help 'ease the transition'.


While Bowser, unsurprisingly, refused to comment on reports of a Switch successor specifically, he highlighted to Inverse (in the same interview where he discussed unionisation at Nintendo) the work the company has done on its single sign-in Nintendo Accounts. 


"One thing we've done with the Switch to help with that communication and transition [to a new console generation]", Bowser explained, "is the formation of the Nintendo Account. In the past, every device we transitioned to had a whole new account system. Creating the Nintendo Account will allow us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salt and Sacrifice, the follow-up to Ska Studios' enormously enjoyable 2D Soulslike Salt and Sanctuary, is making the jump to Switch and Steam (following a period of Epic Games Store exclusivity) on 7th November.


Salt and Sacrifice serves up another gloomy slab of side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat, albeit one that builds on its 2016 predecessor with a variety of new features, as players - in the role of a Marked Inquisitor - make their way across the world of Alterstone Kingdom, and its abandoned villages, dungeons, tomb-temples, and other landmarks.


Those new features include a refreshed choice of classes - Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage - plus Mage hunts, which play out as multi-part pursuits that culminate in a fearsome boss battle. There's also enhanced PvP - with new moves and different objectives depending on your chosen sect - and, for those with a more collaborative streak, two-player online and off-line co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia, the acclaimed - and previously Epic Games Store-exclusive - survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is coming to Steam on 8th November.


While Santa Ragione (which also published Lorenzo Redaelli's stellar post-COVID horror Mediterranea Inferno earlier this year) hasn't quite managed to get Saturnalia onto Steam in time for Halloween, it remains a spookily good time - whisking players away to the ancient village of Gravoi for an Sardinian folklore-inspired adventure that Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin called a "horrible nightmare in all the right ways" in his Recommended review.


The aim of Saturnalia is to solve the mystery of Gravoi and escape its confines, exploring and avoiding its horrors along the way. To that end, players can switch between four different characters at will as they try to win their freedom, but if everyone dies, the town reconfigures its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

Bowser shared his thoughts in an interview with Inverse, saying, "You only have to look at our retention numbers, which are very, very high within the industry, and our obviously low turnover rate as a result. Our focus has always been on creating a culture that's inclusive, has a work-life balance, and is focused on our singular mission of bringing smiles to faces."


Bowser added he believes Nintendo is "on the right path" when it comes to creating a "work environment and culture that allows people to be productive, to have balance in their lives, and to grow within the company".

This week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer sounded a note of caution over how quickly we'd see the fruits of Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition for ourselves. There will be no immediate drop of Activision classics on Xbox Game Pass, and no sudden insertion of Master Chief in Call of Duty. 
Long-term, though, Spencer is keen to hear from Activision's teams about what they want to make - whether that's a return to Guitar Hero, Skylanders or Tony Hawk games, or something else entirely. We also ponder Microsoft's plans for a mobile game presence, driven by Candy Crush maker King. Could Gears of War turn up on mobile? What about Viva Piñata? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

This brisk performance was achieved by Mae, a known speedrunner in the Baldur's Gate 3 community. Mae previously managed to complete a Sex Any% speedrun in just under eight minutes, and has been whittling that time down ever since. 


"After just over two months, the Baldur's Gate 3 speedrunning community has finally peaked. The two minute barrier has been shattered," Mae celebrated on their YouTube channel earlier today. "We can now bang Lae'zel in under two minutes, even faster than a speedrunner can last in real life. This is the world's first sub-two minute run and the new world record."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 released today, with a storyline that developer Insomniac has said will take, on average, about 15 hours to complete if you just stick to the main story missions. If players decide to delve deeper, and complete side missions and collectables, that gameplay time could be extended to around 40 hours. 


When it first came to light that Spider-Man 2's main story could be wrapped up in a relatively short amount of time - especially when compared to the likes of this year's Baldur's Gate 3, which can take players literal days to complete - some felt that Insomniac was asking too high a price for its sequel. Here in the UK, Spider-Man 2 is £69.99 for the standard PS5 edition. If players want to upgrade to the digital deluxe version, it will set them back £79.99. 


Many have argued that game length should influence the retail price of a product, and therefore Spider-Man 2 should be priced lower than what is essentially £70. Insomniac's creative director Bryan Intihar has weighed in on this, and said that Spider-Man 2 is absolutely "worth it".

The "calf dribble", as it's been dubbed by some in the FIFA community, allows dribblers with the Trickster Playstyle to attach the ball to their calf and then simply run into the opposition's net to score.
As funny as it is to watch, that's definitely not how it's meant to work, in video game or real-life football.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Friday, and I have found another fun thing to share with you all, this time in Halo Infinite's Forge mode.

Halo Infinite's Forge mode has long been used as a canvas for many video game related homages. We have seen the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's iconic Kokiri Forest pop up here, as well as PT's terrifying corridor and Call of Duty's famous Shipment map. Blood Gulch is even in there (although, actually that one wasn't really a surprise, but all the same very cool)


The possibilities this mode can invoke are seemingly endless, and the recent update that came with Season 5: Reckoning has made this even more apparent. You see, developer 343 added the ability to include Campaign AI. This is thanks to the addition of Forge's AI Toolkit and its accompanying suite of features, which means Halo Infinite players can now spawn Grunts and such into their creations.

The game is a free-to-play tactical RPG title which was released globally in 2020. Although our usual Final Fantasy correspondent (Ed) is not here, I try to (or at least like to think I do) stay up-to-date with the series and I've never heard of it before.

The trailer shows our two webbed heroes recalling past battles against the likes of Dr Otto Octavius. They also reflect on their lost loved ones, like Aunt May and Miles' dad, Jefferson "Jeff" Davis. It's touching stuff.


Now, if you were watching that and thinking "Great! I love Spider-Man, and even with the sequel just out I already want more", you may also be asking yourself: "Venom I going to get a villain-focused spinoff, in the style of Spider-Man: Miles Morales?"

Paradox says Astral Planes is predominantly focused on delivering "mid-to-late game exploration content", introducing 30 Astral Rifts where players can experience branching narratives and storylines - utilising a "dedicated interface, specifically designed to maximize the effects of player choice" - taking place in completely different realms of existence.

It's called the Chilling Update (because of all the snow, yes?) and it's available now.


The Chilling Update - also known as v1.7.0 - introduces a new playable character, a new bonus stage, a new evolving weapon, two new relics, six new EXTRA achievements, and a new music track. If that's enough information to get you salivating and you'd rather avoid spoiling the fun before diving in, stop reading now - otherwise it's time to go through all the above in more detail, starting with the new stage, Whiteout.


Whiteout is described a "20-minute bonus stage" in Poncle's patch notes, and it's unlocked by picking up a total of 20 Orologions. Once inside, players will encounter snowmen insistent on blocking their path, and face enemies which, according to Poncle, move very slowly and are particularly susceptible to fire. "So for most of it," the studio explains, "there isn't anything particularly challenging" - although you might want to save your spicy sausage for the boss.

As is the way with these things, Conduit - described by developer Respawn as a "tiny titan of optimism" - gets her introduction by way of a new Stories from the Outlands lore trailer. And, yes, there's more Titanfall fan-baiting to try and distract everyone from the fact we still haven't got a Titanfall 3, despite persistent teasing from the studio.


Once upon time, you see, Conduit's life was saved by a Monarch Titan during a violent battle that threatened to destroy her hometown - the machine's pilot choosing to sacrifice themselves in a massive detonation that would ultimately bring fighting to an explosive end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been three years since Ubisoft announced it was working on a VR instalment of Assassin's Creed, and with the game - now officially titled Assassin's Creed Nexus VR - nearing its release, the company has shared an extensive eight-minute gameplay breakdown to get players in the mood ahead of its November launch on Meta Quest 2, 3, and Pro.


Assassin's Creed Nexus VR (which Ubisoft describes as an "all-new full-length Assassin's Creed action-adventure game") casts players as an elite hacker working undercover at Abstergo on behalf of the Brotherhood. From here, they'll be able to shove their eyes into the heads of three returning series protagonists - Ezio Auditore, Connor, and Kassandra - in an attempt to locate a number of mysterious artefacts they encountered during their lives.


It's a quest that, in classic series fashion, will see players scrambling, sneaking, stabbing, and clobbering their way around some big open maps, this time spanning Renaissance Italy, Colonial America, and Ancient Greece - including Venice, Boston, and even some new locations such as Newport (presumably the Rhode Island one and not the one in Wales).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 mightn't be out yet, but if your excitement is so vast you're already pondering a second play-through, you'll be pleased to know the game will - like its predecessor - be getting a New Game Plus mode, but it'll be arriving sometime after launch.


That's according to Insomniac's director of community and marketing, James Stevenson, who shared the news in answer to a fan query on social media. "We' re working on an update for those features," he explained, adding, "but they won't be in Day 1."


Insomniac's original Marvel's Spider-Man launched in September 2018 and received a New Game Plus mode just one month later - and it appears the studio is aiming to add the feature to Spider-Man 2 in a similarly brisk fashion, with Stevenson later explaining Insomniac is hoping to get New Game Plus out to players "before end of year."

The Evil Within 2 is the sequel to Shinji Mikami's 2014 return to survival horror, and Edwin found it entertainin but lacking with its spooks, in his Evil Within 2 review back in 2017. The game follows police detective Sebastian Castellanos as he attempts to rescue his daughter from a virtual town which is overrun with mutated people. 
If you want to play The Evil Within before dipping into the sequel, it's currently one of the freebies on offer at the Epic Games Store, alongside Eternal Threads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has released a big budget live-action Xbox Series X/S advert, timed for the holiday season, which showcases several high-profile console exclusives. 


The advert begins with a young woman making her way home from what is presumably a long day at work. As Nintendo did earlier in the year when it released its live-action Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, Microsoft seems to be highlighting the welcome relief games can provide, away from the everyday, rain-soaked mundane. 


This young lady in question is soon swept out of her apartment block's lift and transported into a world of wonder and excitement. Starfield's Vasco holds her bag as a spaceship blasts off. Her world turns upside down again, as the wandering whispers of Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 surround her. She leaves, to suddenly find her corridor turned into a Forza racetrack, and then find a random Cyberpunk 2077 chap in her flat chopping up pineapples with furious force. You get the idea.

Sony announced its PS5 Slim last week, which will launch in November in the US before being rolled out to other countries. Once inventory of the existing model has sold out, the new Slim model will be the only one available.



Billbil-kun of Dealabs has noted several Japanese merchants have opened pre-orders, with a release date of 10th November, suggesting this might be when it's available in the US too.

For those unfamiliar, this is generally how new FM games roll out each year, with a period of up to a month before the official release date - in FM24's case, 6th November - being marked out as a kind of final public test, which you can gain access to by pre-ordering the game with a small discount.
It's the same again here, albeit with just two-and-a-half weeks until it's out this time, and with the shift to calling it Early Access from now on, as Sports Interactive gaffer Miles Jacobson is keen to emphasise.

Reddick stars as Hellboy in Web of Wyrd, a roguelike action brawler. It promises an original story, which the studio has curated in partnership with Dark Horse Comics as well as Hellboy's own creator Mike Mignola, although one which doesn't interfere with what Mignola himself is up to. 


"When an agent of the BPRD goes missing, Hellboy is sent to investigate; pulling him into the depths of the Wyrd," the game's description reads. You can see how it looks, and hear the late, great Lance Reddick, in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, Marvel's Spider-Man 2's fast-travel hold-to-confirm prompt is not hiding a load point. It could have been even faster, but developer Insomniac made the decision to value player usability over speed and scoring points on the internet.


Spider-Man 2's fast-travel capabilities have been widely shared across social media, and are so slick that some players have said they believe the requirement to hold down a button and confirm your fast-travelling before shooting off across the game's map was all designed as a bit of trickery to hide background loading. 


Well, that's not the case. This theory has now been squashed by Insomniac's own director of core technologies Mike Fitzgerald. As part of a ResetEra thread discussing Spider-Man 2's review scores, Fitzgerald said Insomniac discussed removing the hold-to-confirm prompt in a bid to "address that accusation", before it ultimately decided this wasn't the best idea.

The earbuds would be stored in a pair of slots located inside the controller. As well as charging them, the controller would also pair the earbuds to a console.
The patent (spotted by GameRant) contains different variations of where the earbuds could be slotted into the controller. Most of the designs propose the earbuds are stored behind the touchpad, though one option places an earbud in each of the controller's grips.

Thankfully some balance changes have also been made. For instance, the price of seeds has now been reduced - these are used to create temporary checkpoints throughout the world but were an expensive and limited resource.

The government argued that Sullivan should have informed the FTC of the 2016 incident, but instead went out of his way to conceal it from them.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also accused Sullivan of attempting to conceal the breach itself by paying $100,000 to buy the silence of the two hackers behind the compromise. Sullivan had characterized the payment as a bug bounty similar to ones that other companies routinely make to researchers who report vulnerabilities and other security issues to them. His lawyers pointed out that Sullivan had made the payment with the full knowledge and blessing of Travis Kalanick, Uber&#8217;s CEO at the time, and other members of the ride-sharing giant&#8217;s legal team...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zen Studios, the team behind the Pinball FX series, is reportedly one of the latest companies to have been hit by layoffs this year.


As shared by Videogamelayoffs (via VGC), an unnamed source from the studio revealed 32 members of staff from the Hungary-based developer had lost their jobs earlier this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has outlined some of the new Xbox accessibility features due in the coming months, including the ability to remap keyboard keys to the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2.


As detailed over on Xbox Wire, players will soon be able to remap almost 90 keyboard keys - or combinations of keys - to any button on the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2, meaning users with limited mobility can, for instance, use the Xbox Adaptive Controller with games that would ordinarily only support mouse/keyboard.


The feature - which will be available through the Xbox Accessories app on PC and console - is currently being tested by Xbox Insiders and Xbox Accessibility Insiders League (XAIL) members, but is due to launch for all players at some point "in the coming months".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt has officially brought the development of its Witcher card game spin-off Gwent to a close with one last update, putting all future balance changes in the hands of the community.


Gwent, of course, started life as a turn-based card-collecting mini-game in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (although, technically, it existed on the page of author Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher novels before that) and was expanded into its own full-scale release in 2018.


As development has continued, Gwent has recieved new cards, content updates, and expansions - as well as a standalone single-player story campaign in 2020's Thronebreaker and a rogue-like solo deck-builder in 2022's Gwent: Rogue Mage - but last December brought the news CD Projekt would wind down development after three new expansions in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox has confirmed Cities: Skylines 2 won't be getting official mod support until sometime after next week's release, with the feature set to arrive alongside its first wave of modding tools.


Official mod support was one of the original Cities: Skylines' most exciting features when it launched back in 2015, and the city builder quickly developed a vibrant modding scene that played a significant role in its early success. More than 333,000 mods are now available for the first Cities: Skylines via Steam Workshop, and Paradox has even tapped modders to create official DLC for the game over the years.


As for Cities: Skylines' imminent sequel, Paradox broke the news that mods would not be officially supported at launch in a developer diary shared on its website. And while it hasn't yet offered an estimated time of arrival for the feature, it's now published a second mod-focused developer update explaining official mod tools and mod support will arrive simulataneously post-release, once Cities: Skylines 2's all-in-one Editor leaves beta testing.

Mega Crit was one of many developers to criticise Unity's decision to begin charging studios fees based on the number times their game was installed by a user (Unity has since walked back on some of its changes, and CEO John Riccitiello departed not long after), writing, "Despite the immense amount of time and effort our team has already poured into the development on our new title, we will be migrating to a new engine unless the changes are completely reverted and [Terms of Service] protections are put in place."


Shortly after Unity's controversial announcement, Mega Crit held a three-week game jam to "explore the Godot engine due to 'recent events'". The result of those experiments is Dancing Duelists, a "deckbuilding autobattler dance off with a BUMPIN' soundtrack".

Nintendo has released the final part of its Ask the Developer interview for the game, which includes discussion of live commentary that was ultimately scrapped.


"Tezuka-san also once asked, 'Can't we have live commentary?'. I had absolutely no clue what he meant. But I interpreted it as a desire for a new experience, even if it's not necessarily in the form of live commentary," said Shiro Mouri, the game's director.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Second Extinction developer Systemic Reaction has announced it is ending active development on the game. The game's servers will remain online for now, but Systemic Reactions plans to shut them down next year.
Second Extinction is a co-op, online shooter set in a futuristic world where mutated dinosaurs threaten humans. It released in early access for PC in 2020, and Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021. The game's 1.0 version was meant to release late last year, but "critical" and "show-stopping" issues caused the studio to delay it.
"Unfortunately, it became clear that our small team lacked the resources necessary to hit our quality targets," Systemic Reaction said on Steam, "and the investment needed to do so was too large for us to bear". As such, the developer has decided to cancel the game's full release.

Spencer is now off to meet Activision Blizzard's many teams in person, via a whistlestop tour of the company's studios. There, he said he will discuss what the teams want to work on.

Speaking on the Official Xbox Podcast, Spencer acknowledged the recent suggestion by Activision Blizzard that it would take until 2024 to get its games added to Microsoft's subscription service, and discussed why there wasn't going to be a big drop of games sooner - as happened when Microsoft bought Bethesda.


Spencer even noted there had been "a lot of uncertainty" in the buyout process for Microsoft - right up until the deal was finally approved by the UK's regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, last week.

Phasmophobia was originally meant to release into early access on console in August, but an office fire incident in August caused developer Kinect Games to push launch back to October.

The release date is being pushed back again, meaning Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait a little bit longer to join the ghost-hunting. In a developer update posted to Steam, Kinect Games attributed the latest delay to August's fire incident and issues in porting the game to consoles and VR.

In an interview on the official Xbox podcast, the exec spoke more about last week's historic merger that finally saw Microsoft close the deal on its Activision Blizzard King buyout. He phil-ed us in, if you will. 


Of course, during last night's interview, the topic of Call of Duty came up. This series has often been front and centre of the ongoing trials and tribulations of recent times. In fact, at one point, Sony suggested Microsoft could deliberately release a version of the game on PlayStation platforms with degraded performance (something Microsoft said it would not do).

Coral Island, which entered early access last October on Steam and the Microsoft Store, is yet another entry in the ever-growing list of farming sims heavily inspired by Stardew Valley's more modern take on the genre (it even has an evil corporate entity of its own), but it's aiming to set itself apart with a focus on ocean exploration and conservation.


Of course, all the familiar genre staples are present and correct too, including farming, crafting, fishing, mining, decorating, socialising, and, of course, wooing, with Coral Island featuring 25 eligible islanders to romance as one season gives way to the next.

Unfortunately, not all technical issues have been resolved as yet, and Blizzard has been forced to temporarily disable cross-play between PC and consoles while it attempts to find a solution.


"We are working to resolve this," the developer explained in an update on social media, "and will provide updates as they are available."


Season of Blood arrives alongside Diablo 4's Steam release, which also saw a bit of a delay earlier today. It comes with a 25% launch week discount, ending on 24th October, meaning you can currently pick it up for £44.99 instead of the usual £59.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has announced it is parting ways with BattleTech developer Harebrained Schemes, citing "strategic and creative priorities". The seperation follows last week's news that Harebrained Schemes' The Lamplighters League has been a $22m flop for Paradox.


Harebrained was founded in 2011 by Mitch Gitelman and Jordan Weisman (co-creator of the BattleTech and MechWarrior universe), and was acquired by Paradox Interactive in 2018 after it published the studio's critically acclaimed BattleTech game that same year.


The Lamplighters League, which launched earlier this month, was Harebrained's first release as a Paradox studio but it arrived to middling reviews and failed to generate much commercial interest. Paradox went as far as to call its commercial performance a "big disappointment" last week, when it admitted the pulp strategy game was unlikely to recoup its development costs, resulting in a $22.7m USD write-down.

Epic has whacked a free playable 20-minute Alan Wake recap episode that should serve as a refresher while offering a bit of spooky battery gobbling fun along the way.


Alan's first adventure, released all the way back in 2010, sees the eponymous writer taking a working holiday with his wife, Alice, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls. Needless to say, it doesn't take long for things to go awry, and, soon, Alan - with occasional help from his agent BARRY - is monologuing his way through the night, blasting malevolent beings to smithereens with his torch and revealing the next big spooky event 10 seconds before it happens because he can't keep his mouth shut.


Or at least that's how I remember it. Presumably Epic's newly released Alan Wake: Flashback - a 'reimagining' of the original tale, developed in collaboration with Remedy Entertainment, Spiral House, and Zen Creative - will do a better and more reliable job of filling you in on all the important story beats ahead of Alan Wake 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exactly 364 after its announcement, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught - NetherRealm's free-to-play character-collecting RPG - is out of beta testing and available to download on iOS and Android.


Mortal Kombat: Onslaught's big selling point is its "mobile-exclusive" story - promising "high quality graphics, cinematic cutscenes, and bone-krushing kombat" - that'll see players joining forces with Raiden in a bid to prevent fallen Elder God Shinnok from gathering relics and regaining his evil powers. All that plays out through "massive real-time group battles", featuring up to ten fighters at once, that'll require players to tailor their team of four champions to take on progressively more difficult challenges.


More specifically, progress involves collecting and assembling a team from a "massive" catalogue of Assassins, Warriors, Snipers, and Defenders - including the familiar likes of Sub-Zero, Liu Kang, Scorpion, and Kitana, plus "rare, fan-favourite variants" such as Cyrax and Smoke. Each comes with its own unique Special Moves, Affinities and Passive Skills, and players will need to evolve their characters' combat skills, level their gear, and equip Relics.

The reason for that may be the state of the game at release. Full walkthroughs and cutscene footage have been shared on social media and are gaining traction for the game's poor quality.
IguanaBee is a small studio based in Chile which developed party game Headsnatchers and third person shooter G.I. Joe: Operation Blackout. GameMill Entertainment is a company which has published games for franchises through licensing deals. Its most successfully published title is Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, which a sequel is in development for.

Epic only acquired Bandcamp, the self-styled "online record store and music community", last year.

Its subsequent sale to Songtradr was then announced last month.


In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Epic confirmed the recent Bandcamp layoffs were part of its previous wave of cuts, which were announced at the end of September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a mere few days away from release and the reviews and impressions have started rolling in across the web (no pun intended, but isn't it nice when it just happens). Many have praised the game's action, slick traversal and story, but one area that has been highlighted away from your typical professional assessment is the puddles. 

Some players felt the first Spider-Man game was lacking in the puddle density department, noting the game's E3 2017 gameplay trailer had larger and better defined puddles than in the released version. This caused quite a stir on social media and was eventually dubbed "puddlegate".

Insomniac took this all in its stride, and actually added a playful fix for Spider-Man's puddlegate in the form of puddle stickers. However, it's already clear its sequel won't need stickers to 'fix' its puddles, as they are looking pretty dense and wet from where I am sitting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video purporting to show an unused post-credits scene found within the files of Assassin's Creed Mirage may point to a seismic upcoming shift in series' story.


Filenames for the scene reference "Assassin's Creed Neo", an internal Ubisoft codename believed to refer to one of several upcoming projects currently in development. Thus, the big twist revealed here is expected to be something we see more of in future games. 


For those who'd rather be left unspoiled, this is your last chance to turn away now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Epic's announcement in August it would give third-party developers 100 percent of revenue for six months of Epic Games Store exclusivity on new games, the company - which laid off 16% of its workforce earlier this month - is now attempting to get developers on its storefront by promising 100% revenue on their back catalogue titles.


Today marks the official launch of the company's Epic First Run scheme, described as an "opt-in exclusivity program for third-party developers and publishers" that promises to boost Epic's usual 88% revenue cut for developers all the way up to 100% if they agree to keep their new game exclusive to the Epic Games Store for the first sixth months of release.


And the company is now complementing that offer by pledging to give developers - in a scheme it's calling Now On Epic - a six-month 100% revenue cut for bringing over games "currently live on another third-party PC store or included in a third-party subscription service available on another third-party PC store". Games must have been released on other storefronts before 31st October this year, and after six months of being on the Epic Games Store, revenue reverts to Epic's standard 88%/12% split.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just short of a month after Payday 3's decidedly rocky launch, which left many unable to play the always-online heist shooter, its long-awaited first patch is still nowhere to be seen; developer Starbreeze has announced a second delay for the update, most recently expected "mid-October", after it "identified some issues that need to be fixed".


Payday 3 got off to a wobbly start in September, with the game drawing criticism for its matchmaking issues, its online-only requirements (proving particularly irksome for solo players forced into lengthy queues), and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system.


Matchmaking has now been improved, and Starbreeze has pledged at least "some changes" to progression, but Payday 3's first patch is still eagerly awaited given that it promises some "200+" quality of life improvements for all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Cities: Skylines 2's release next week, publisher Paradox Interactive has admitted the city building sequel has "not achieved the [performance] benchmark we targeted". However, rather than delaying the game to remedy those issues the publisher has decided "releasing now is the best way forward".


The somewhat astonishing admission was shared in a post on the official Paradox forum, written to address "concerns raised about Cities: Skylines 2 performance" following the publisher's decision to increase Cities Skylines 2's minimum and recommended specs on PC and to delay the game on Xbox and PS5 into spring next year.


"Cities: Skylines 2 is a next-gen title, and naturally, it demands certain hardware requirements," the publisher wrote. "With that said, while our team has worked tirelessly to deliver the best experience possible, we have not achieved the benchmark we targeted."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Psychedelic horror Layers of Fear - the 2023 remake as opposed to the 2016 original - is getting a free new story chapter on 24th October to mark developer Bloober Team's 15th anniversary.


Layers of Fear (again, the new one) already featured a decent chunk of new content, of course, reconfiguring the stories of Layers of Fear 1 and 2, as well as the first game's Inheritance DLC, into a single narrative - all spruced up with striking Unreal Engine 5 visuals and new gameplay elements. And then there's a new story chapter featuring the original protagonist's wife, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer.


Bloober's newly announced Halloween/birthday treat makes yet another tortured artist - joining the Painter, Actor, Musician, and Writer from the base game - playable in Layers of Fear, this time dropping players into the director;s seat as they take the reins of a troubled Hollywood production. "Immerse yourself into the psyche of the movie's creator as you seek to complete your final masterpiece," Bloober teases, "even as the set around you descends into chaos".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix is reportedly looking to build upon its current, predominantly mobile-focused gaming offerings by introducing "higher-end" titles to its subscription catalogue - and is said to have had discussions about licensing a Grand Theft Auto game as part of the move.


The streaming company took its first tentative steps into gaming back in November 2021, with the release of five iOS and Android titles that could be downloaded and played as part of a Netflix subscription. Since then, its gaming catalogue has swelled to over 70 titles and it's made a number notable acquisitions, including Triple Town and Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox, The Walking Dead mobile developer Next Games, and Oxenfree creator Night School Studio.


Hints of more ambitious gaming plans at Netflix came with last November's announcement the company had set up a new Los Angeles studio - lead by former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny - to create a brand-new triple-A, third-person RPG for PC. And a new report from the Wall Street Journal has shed further light on Netflix plans, saying the company is "taking steps to expand into higher-end games that can be streamed from TVs or PCs."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After Cyberpunk 2077's much anticipated release in 2020 failed to live up to expectations, the team's morale took a "significant hit". 


That's according to Colin Walder, an engineering director at CD Projekt Red with over 15 years of experience in the games industry, who previously worked on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Rockstar titles Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto 5. Walder recently spoke to invenglobal at the Inven Game Conference in South Korea, where he discussed lessons learned from Cyberpunk 2077. 


"This approach we had, the way we were working production-wise, creating demos, and moving towards an agile mindset and workflow - it's about ensuring we're on top of certain things from the start," Walder said. "Take consoles, for example; we need to make sure they're functioning from the get-go. For our next project, Polaris [part of a new trilogy of games in CDPR's Witcher series], we're already running our demos and internal reviews on the console from the very beginning."

<blockquote><p>Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Persi Diaconis. The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started&#8212;Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51%.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Could future coin tossers use the same-side bias to their advantage? The magnitude of the observed bias can be illustrated using a betting scenario. If you bet a dollar on the outcome of a coin toss (i.e., paying 1 dollar to enter, and winning either 0 or 2 dollars depending on the outcome) and repeat the bet 1,000 times, knowing the starting position of the coin toss would earn you 19 dollars on average. This is more than the casino advantage for 6 deck blackjack against an optimal-strategy player, where the casino would make 5 dollars on a comparable bet, but less than the casino advantage for single-zero roulette, where the casino would make 27 dollars on average. These considerations lead us to suggest that when coin flips are used for high-stakes decision-making, the starting position of the coin is best concealed...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

EGX, the UK's biggest games event, ran from Thursday to Sunday last week and is run by Eurogamer's parent company Reedpop.


Protestors attempted to squirt orange paint at a screen displaying an in-progress Tekken match, before daubing more on the two players' screens. They then began a short speech, before being dragged off by security.

All of which comes as Mojang announces an absolutely monster milestone: Minecraft has now sold over 300m copies, meaning it's still the best-selling game to date, but is now well over 100m sales ahead of its nearest rival, GTA 5.


Back to Minecraft Live, though, and Mojang's celebrations began with the reveal of Minecraft's Star Wars: Path of the Jedi DLC, which comes to the in-game Marketplace on 7th November. It'll give players the chance to rise through the ranks from padawan to Jedi Knight - meaning, yes, there's lightsaber combat and Force powers - on a journey featuring familiar Star Wars characters and locations to explore.


There's more Minecraft DLC on the way in the form of a tie-in with the BBC's upcoming Planet Earth 3, promising to "immerse players in the wonders of the natural world". It'll be available via Minecraft Education and the Minecraft Marketplace when it arrives in 2024.

The card was initially a free add-on for Pokémon Center customers, given out at a rate of one card for each item in the Van Gogh collection bought, but scalpers descended onto the store in droves, wiped out the supply, and then immediately put their wares on internet auction sites at grossly inflated prices.

"The Van Gogh Museum and The Pokémon Company International take the safety and security of visitors and staff very seriously," the museum said in a statement, as spotted by our pals at VGC.

Admittedly, it's a bit of a stretch calling it a "launch trailer" given we have five days yet to wait, but nonetheless, it does a sterling job of whetting appetites ahead of the big release on 20th October. 

Captured on the PS5 and including a "mix of gameplay and in-game cinematics", the 1m13s teaser reminds us of the story so far, and what, exactly, is at stake this time around.

In a statement posted to Steam, developer Shiny Shoe said the decision came after it noted that "industry and player sentiment is trending against the presence of these features" and whilst it had always tried to be "as generous and straightforward as possible", it had resolved to remove in-game monetisation "completely" by 27th October 2023. 

Whilst the team says in-game monetisation supported the ongoing development of the game and was "100 per cent optional", content from the existing battle passes – called Levelling Passes here – will now be turned into cosmetic-only optional "supporter packs" DLCs sold on Steam.

As spotted by PCGN, shortly after the video was posted, streamer and YouTuber Raxxanterax posted a video offering some "constructive feedback" after noting several mistakes, including inverted before/after map layouts, and a side-by-side comparison of what is described as "improved" horse speed that looks almost identical.

With "no restriction on playtime", you can join the 27 million other players and jump into Final Fantasy 14 and try A Realm Reborn, Heavensward, and Stormblood for free, and keep playing until you hit level 70. The free trial also includes 16 different jobs "including some fan favourites from throughout Final Fantasy history".

"Hydaelyn – a vibrant planet blessed by the Light of the Crystal. Amid azure seas, encompassing the westernmost of the Three Great Continents, there lies a realm embraced by gods and forged by heroes," Square Enix teases. "Her name...Eorzea. It is here that your tale unfolds. Beckoned by the Mothercrystal – the source of all life – you must embark upon a quest to deliver the land from an eternity of Darkness."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 is just days away from launching on Steam, and one obvious question that's arisen following the news of its storfront jump - will it work on Steam Deck? - has finally be answered by Blizzard. And it's good news, taking the form of a 'Steam Deck Verified' yes.


I'll be honest, I've not actually played Diablo 4, but its predecessor was an absolute treat to have readily, portably to hand on Switch, so I can very much see why fans of Blizzard's latest would be keen for news on its Steam Deck compatibility.


And, thankfully, Diablo's global community development director Adam Fletcher had good news to share when he broached the topic in response to fan queries on social media. "We can happily say," Fletcher wrote, "that Diablo 4 will be Steam Deck Verified starting next Tuesday with the launch of the game on Steam and the start of Season of Blood!".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a Counter-Strike 2 player with an AMD GPU, pay attention: Valve has warned that the company's latest GPU driver has introduced a new feature that, if activated, will result in a Steam VAC ban. So, basically, proceed with caution.


Here's what's going on; AMD's newly released Adrenalin Edition 23.10.1 driver adds, among other things, Anti-Lag+ support for Counter-Strike 2, which, on the face of it, seems like an entirely positive thing. After all, who wouldn't want less lag in their fiercely competitive online shooty game?


Unfortunately, the way the Anti-Lag+ feature works - it does its job by "detouring engine dll functions", according to Valve - can have serious consequences for Counter-Strike 2 players who opt to turn it on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Microsoft's $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition now officially a done deal as of today, Ubisoft has been discussing its new ownership of all Activision Blizzard streaming rights, which also kick in today - and as part of the conversation, it's talked a little about physical media, saying that while interesting might decline as streaming rises, it doesn't think it's "going away".


Ubisoft secured the streaming rights to all Activision Blizzard games (for the next 15 years, and outside the EU, at least) as part of revisions made by Microsoft to get its proposed acquisition across the finish line after UK regulators blocked the deal highlighting concerns around its potential impact on the emerging cloud gaming market.


With the deal now approved and Microsoft officially the owner of Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft's role as streaming rights licensor of Activision's games has come into effect too. The Assassin's Creed publisher has shared a Q&A to mark the occasion, discussing its view on the future of game streaming and clarifying some aspects of its agreement with Microsoft - including reconfirmation Activision Blizzard games are coming to its own Ubisoft+ subscription service.

Molyneux revealed the game is currently codenamed MOAT, an acronym, last month.

In a statement shared with Eurogamer, the CWA said today's merger represents a "milestone" in the industry.


"Under the terms of a ground-breaking, legally-binding labour neutrality agreement, Microsoft will remain neutral when Activision Blizzard employees express interest in joining a union, providing a clear path to collective bargaining for almost 10,000 workers," the CWA said, with its president Claude Cummings Jr calling this a "new day" for Activision Blizzard employees following mass employee protests in 2021.

A statement from Xbox boss Phil Spencer says similar, with Kotick's tenure at the company set to continue through "the end of 2023" to "ensure a smooth and seamless integration". 


Neither notice makes it explicit what will happen next year, though the wording of both statements suggests Kotick's departure is possible as early as January 2024.

Today's long-awaited deal closure finalises a process that has dragged on through almost two years of regulatory approvals and legal wrangling. Finally, however, it is done - hours after the UK ultimately gave the deal a green light.


Microsoft now owns Activision, including the world's biggest first-person shooter franchise Call of Duty, alongside the rights to Spyro, Skylanders, and Guitar Hero.

The late Miłogost Reczek's voice was reproduced by an AI algorithm for Phantom Liberty - the base game's recent expansion - for its Polish-language release. 
In a statement shared with Bloomberg, CD Projekt said it had obtained permission from Reczek's family to recreate the actor's voice in this way for the expansion.

Producer Yoshimi Yasuda made the announcement earlier today on social media.
Last year, Yasuda stated Lollipop Chainsaw RePop won't update the original's story or aesthetics. "We want to make it so that the game can be as close to the original version as possible," Yasuda said, echoing the only major aspect which will be changed is the game's licensed music soundtrack.

<p>Several teachers whom I spoke with or who responded to my questionnaire mentioned policies stating that students cannot get lower than a 50 percent on any assignment, even if the work was never done, in some cases.

This "Really Useful Starfield" mod was created and uploaded by the aptly named Trainwiz, who has kindly provided us with a rather sinister backstory explaining Thomas' arrival in space.


"For his crimes against God and his invention of murder, Thomas was smote, thusly. Rejected from Hell and obviously never going to get into Heaven, they say that the Tank Engine has been banished to wander the stars forever, unable to satiate his bloodlust and unable to find peace in his heart," Trainwiz begins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been looking to stock up on the spooks and scares in anticipation of this year's impending Halloween, the Epic Games Store has your back; next week's freebie over there is The Evil Within, the acclaimed horror from Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami. And it's joined by the Eurogamer recommended Eternal Threads.


The Evil Within - which was created by Ghostwire: Tokyo and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, the studio Mikami departed earlier this year - released all the way back in 2014, dragging players, in the role of rugged police detective Sebastian Castellanos, along on a positively bonkers ride through the shape-shifting likes of a dilapidated asylum, a fading mansion, a mannequin factory, and more.


It's a return to the kind of nail-bitingly tense third-person survival horror Mikami's Resident Evil games - particularly the revolutionary Resident Evil 4 - were known for, and it all plays out like an enthusiastic love letter to the horror genre as a whole, packing in everything from sadistic chainsaw-wielding cannibals to J-horror-style hair ghosts. It's great, despite a few rough edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a dramatic day for internet-sleuthing Mario fans; with Nintendo still tightlipped on who'll take over the role of the iconic plumber following Charles Martinet's acension to "Mario Ambassador", a fresh leak appeared to have finally revealed video gaming's current biggest secret. However, the actor in question - one Mick Wingert - has now thrown a bit of a spanner in the works by declaring that, no, it's not actually him.


To rewind a bit, all this started when (thanks VGC) an anonymous 4chan forum user shared images and details said to be from a US kiosk demo for Switch's soon-to-be-released Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Some of those images revealed previously unseen areas of the game, suggesting the leak was, in fact, legit - suddenly making an accompanying 20-strong unverified list of Mario Wonder voice actors a lot more interesting.


Now relatively sure of the list's veracity, internet sleuths began combing through the names - unhelpfully provided with no hint of the roles they're playing in-game - trying to figure out if one them might just be the new voice of Mario. To cut a long story short, after removing returning Mario series voice actors, indentifiable foreign language actors, and female actors, only two names remained: Kevin Afghani and Mick Wingert.

Alien: Blackout follows Amanda Ripley (daughter of Ellen Ripley) as she attempts to guide four survivors to safety aboard the Xenomorph-infested Mendel Station, viewing their progress through security cameras and via an overhead station map.


It's officially "not related" to Creative Assembly's superb 2014 first-person horror Alien: Isolation, despite being set just a few days after the game and sharing a protagonist - although that bit of information wasn't revealed until Blackout's announcement began to draw ire from fans angry at what appeared to be a sequel releasing exclusively for mobile.

EA Sports FC Tactical was first mentioned during EA's grand unveiling for its new-look football series back in July. At the time, information on the game was limited, but the publisher has now shared a little more as pre-registration opens via the iOS App Store and Google Play.


EA says Tactical is all about "in-game strategies, such as stamina and power-play management", and it reimagines EA Sports FC's usual match action as a turn-based experience, with opponents taking it in turns to defend, attack, perform skill moves, and attempt to score goals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has unveiled a new Xbox Series S Starter Bundle, which'll include three months of Game Pass Ultimate when it launches worldwide on 31st October.


All in all, it's a pretty straightforward offering, packing in the Xbox Series S (which comes with 512GB storage as standard), a wireless controller, an HDMI cable, and the aforementioned three months of Game Pass Ultimate - all for £249.99.


It's the latter that sets the Starter Bundle apart from Microsoft's usual £250 Xbox Series S offering, of course, meaning you're basically getting that three months of Game Pass Ultimate - which would ordinarily cost around £40 - as a freebie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Sony's newly-announced PlayStation 5 "Slim", which is set to launch in the US next month. 
Repeatedly leaked, the PS5 Slim's existence was not too much of a surprise, though word that its digital version would cost more in the US and that you now need to splash out £25 to stand the console upright still managed to raise some eyebrows. 
Rather than a proper mid-gen refresh, the Slim is more of a redesign - with no real incentive for existing PS5 owners to upgrade. Still, is a good resdesign? Does it position the console's digital edition as the PS5's main version? And most importantly, is standing your console vertical better? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

The CBT (rest in piece CNT) will take place next weekend from 20th to 23rd October. Those with access will be able to try out head-to-head competitive play with cross-platform matching, and the Tekken Fight Lounge, described as an "immersive lobby" where players can interact and explore different features and game modes. 
Footage from the beta can easily be found on social media sites, as well as bewilderment from fans. Bandai Namco rolled out a pre-load update for the beta on Steam and Xbox on 10th, giving those with the know-how the opportunity to crack the PC files.

These attacks, which were verified by PC Gamer, only affected less than 100 Steam users, although NanoWar: Cells VS Virus (pictured above) developer Benoît Freslon recently revealed the hackers had taken control of his browser access tokens. This essentially gave the hackers access to any service Freslon had been logged into. 
"I just used my dev account to release the game few hours before the hack I suppose," he shared on X (formerly Twitter).

You take on the role of a single dad who's a school caretaker (or janitor, seeing as the game takes place in the US) by day, and a mob cleanup crew by night. The mob pays much better than the regular day job, and we need the money to pay for our sick daughter's healthcare. Ah, the good old American healthcare system.

2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla remains the biggest Assassin's Creed launch in the series to date.

Ever wonder how software gets deployed onto a system that is deliberately disconnected from the Internet and other networks? These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature. Sensitive as in utilities (power/water), banking, healthcare, weapons systems, other government use cases, etc. Sometimes it's technically a water gap, if you're running Kubernetes on an underwater vessel. Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.
Again, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments. Traditionally, software artifacts are physically carried across the air gap on hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, or flo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's looking increasingly likely Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard will have cleared its final hurdle if - as is widely expected - UK regulators approve the revised deal later this week; it's being reported EU regulators won't require an investigation into the revised terms, clearing the way for the acquisition to conclude.


The European Commission approved Microsoft's original acquisition proposal back in May after successfully securing a number of concessions to lessen the deal's potential impact on the emerging cloud gaming market. However, Microsoft was forced to submit a revised proposal after the deal was blocked by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority.


These revised terms - which will give Ubisoft exclusive control of streaming rights for Activision's titles outside of the EU - were provisionally approved by the CMA in September, and the regulator is expected to formally approve the deal this Friday, 13th October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery - which bundles together all three entries in developer Worm Club's endearingly silly sleuthing series - will be launching for PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox (including Game Pass) on 27th October.


Fire up Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery, and you'll be able to play The Haunted Island - the 2018 adventure that started it all, wherein our sleuthing lead travels to exotic climes to solve the mystery of a sloth-bothering ghost - alongside its fairly self-explanatory 2019 sequel, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, and Frog Detective's final case, the wild-west-themed Corruption at Cowboy County, which released earlier this year.


These are not particularly lengthy games, each lasting an hour or two (Worm Club's official estimate for the whole Entire Mystery is "the four best hours of your life"), but Frog Detective's warm, silly demeanour still makes for a wonderfully entertaining time. And there's even a scooter in part three so, really, what's not to like?

Last week, YouTuber Volound issued a well-sourced report on Hyenas' downfall, including the detail that it had been Sega's "biggest budget game ever". That report stated Hyenas had been plagued with a lack of direction before it was ultimately canned.
Now, a further video by Volound has shared further quotes on Hyenas from anonymous sources who worked on its development. "I'm paralysed with a mixture of upset and anger over what's happening to my friends there," one person said.

Cloud streaming has been included with PlayStation Plus Premium membership since Sony's revised subscription service launched last year. However, it was previously restricted to streaming PS4 Game Catalogue titles and PS3 and PS2 games from the Classics Catalogue.


Starting this month, though, Premium subscribers can play PlayStation 5 Game Catalogue titles, PlayStation 5 Game Trials, and digital PlayStation 5 titles they've purchased (including associated DLC and in-game purchases) via cloud streaming on their PS5.

The publisher of Worms, Dredge and Hell Let Loose confirmed it was planning to make redundancies earlier this month, after Eurogamer broke news that extensive cuts were being made to Team17's QA department in favour of outsourcing work elsewhere.


But the job losses go much further than those at risk in QA, Eurogamer understands, with staff across a wide range of departments affected - including those employed in Team17's marketing, usability, customer service, IT and HR teams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has called its recent The Lamplighters League a "big disappointment" from a commercial perspective, admitting - just seven days after its release - the pulp strategy game is unlikely to recoup its development costs, resulting in a $22.7m USD write-down.


The Lamplighters League, which was developed by the Paradox-owned Harebrained Schemes, blends tactical turn-based action and real-time stealth in a globe-trotting adventure inspired by the classic pulp stories of the 1930s, giving players control of a disparate group of rogues as they attempt to thwart an occult-obsessed cabal known as the Banished Court.


In truth, it's a deeply uneven experience; at its best, it's a "sublimely atmospheric, richly rewarding tactical adventure" - as I wrote in my 3 out of 5 stars review - but it's too often let down by bland maps, uninspiring mission objectives, and woefully underdeveloped real-time stealth. And it's clearly failed to capture the public's imagination too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has shared a new promo for upcoming release Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and it is really quite charming. 


The short video in question shows Bowser trying his best to woo Princess Peach with a single flower. She looks at him with a certain amount of scepticism, before both are distracted by the bouncy arrival of one of Super Mario Bros. Wonder's elephant power-ups. And, well, when one sees the opportunity to boost one's form into that of a trunk swinging, water spraying mammal, there really is only one thing for it. 


Soon, Peach has ingested (?) the elephantine delectable and is transformed before Bowser's very eyes. He is shocked to say the least, staring at his once demure princess with an open mouth and wide eyes. But, you know what? Our spikey boy is into it. Just when it may seem that Peach - in her enlarged and now tailed form - is about to blast Bowser back to his castle with a swift burst of water, he presents her with an even bigger bunch of flowers. It is a plot twist I wasn't expecting, and it is really rather sweet.

You see, it turns out this Lilith skin is only available through an Ultimate Battle Pass bundle, and that bundle doesn't exactly come cheap - it's £35/$40.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite will drop players back into the game's basic but beloved original map - or at least parts of it.


That's according to a wave of reports from trusted leakers such as HypeX and Shiina, who rely on insider information and details gleaned from within Fortnite's files. 


Yesterday, Fortnite imagery appeared online that referenced a return to the original "Chapter 1" map, as this season's villain Kado Thorne can be seen standing in front of a time machine set to the date "2018 07 12" - that's the day the original map's fifth season launched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sony announced its "slim" models for the regular and digital editions of PlayStation 5, but not without some extra costs being introduced with the line.
For starters, both the regular and digital PS5 slim models will come with a hotizontal stand, but no base. A base is included in the box with the launch models, but if you want to stand the PS5 slim vertically, you'll need to buy a separate vertical stand (compatible with all PS5 models!) for £25, or $30. 
For buyers in North America, the slim model of the digital PS5 is more expensive than the launch model, costing $450 compared to $400, despite its smaller size. The slim PS5 with a disc drive will remain at the same price of $500.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, British eSports announced a partnership with the Saudi eSports Federation. The UK's national body for competitive video gaming said this collaboration aimed to set "new standards of excellence, education and innovation throughout the world of esports". This would include a variety of endeavours between the two parties, including internships, training programs and research projects.


However, British eSports has now acknowledged this news had sparked "concern" - no doubt fuelled by Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, which includes the criminalisation of homosexuality, fewer rights for women and the use of the death penalty. Saudi's Prince Mohammed bin Salman has also been blamed for assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by US intelligence agencies.


As a result, British eSports has released a statement addressing issues raised by the esports community.

The video, which was published by 404media following public records requests, shows the car being driven erratically as the officers race to catch a Snorlax and then a Togetic - the evolved form of Togepi.


The two cops talk excitedly about catching Pokémon while, in the background, radio calls can be heard - including a request for backup at a local shopping mall where a robbery is in progress.

That's according to Bloomberg (paywall), which stated Iger's deputies are keen for the exec "to consider a bolder transformation of Disney from gaming licensee to gaming giant". This could be done through the acquisition of a major publisher, with EA being specifically cited by the publication.


But while Iger's advisors are suggesting that Disney do purchase a company such as EA, at the present time Iger is reportedly remaining "non committal" to the idea. So, do not expect to hear any big announcements in the near future.

The internal event, held days before Microsoft is expected to finally close its $68.7bn takeover of the company, was not available to view publicly, but Windows Central has  reported on what was discussed.


Kotick reportedly reminisced about Activision's journey as a company so far and also dropped several hints about its future - including an intriguing mention of the long-dormant Guitar Hero franchise.

Previously, Critical Strike Damage and Vulnerable Damage were calculated separately, meaning players could use skills with these attributes to pile on huge amounts of damage. 


Now, Critical Strike Damage will be capped at 50 percent and Vulnerable Damage at 20 percent as part of a "baseline multiplicative bonus" - bonus damage will be added together and multiplied by these percentages for each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft players have launched a petition demanding developer Mojang ends its annual mob vote - in which the community gets to vote on a new creature to be added to the game - saying the process 'leaves fantastic ideas on the cutting room floor' and only serves to highlight Minecraft's anaemic content release cycle.


Mojang has now revealed all three mobs that'll be put to the vote ahead of a grand results unveiling during this weekend's Minecraft Live - the crab, the penguin, and the armadillo - and it's a selection a newly launched fan petition describes as "three equally great options".


The petition, which at the time of writing has received 295K signatures from Minecraft fans in the three days since its launch, argues, "Mojang somehow releases less content WITH Microsoft's backing than they did without, [meaning] players see minimal content to the game they love". It continues that by "leaving fantastic ideas on the cutting room floor, and teasing content that will never be seen in the game", players must "watch as possibly the one thing to get them to play again is ripped from them".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocket League developer Psyonix has announced the game will no longer support player-to-player trading as of 5th December this year, as the studio moves to "align with Epic's overall approach to game cosmetics and item shop policies".


Trading was introduced to Rocket League in 2016, giving players the opportunity to exchange certain earned items, including cosmetics dropped at the end of matches and revealed blueprints (but not premium DLC), with other players and third-party trading sites.


From 4pm PST on 5th December this year, however, player-to-player trading will be removed from the game. Explaining the change in a post to its website, Psyonix - which was acquired by Epic Games in 2019 - insisted this would align Rocket League with Epic's "overall approach to game cosmetics and item shop policies, where items aren't tradable, transferrable, or sellable."

Terminator: Resistance originally released back in 2019, whisking players away to a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles - some 31 years after the events of Terminator: Judgment Day - for some first-person shooting action as they, in the role of resistance fighter Jacob Rivers, helped mount an assault against the Terminator menace.


Former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't too keen on the game when he reviewed it back in 2019, calling it "so generic that it has dissolved in my memory like a Skip on my tongue" - and that's despite Terminator: Resistance somehow managing to shoe-horn in two "inexplicably cringe" first-person sex scenes along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classic WW2 real-time stealth-tactics series Commandos is being revived for a sixth entry, Commandos: Origins, and it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.


Commandos, if you're unfamiliar, first made a splash back in 1998 with launch of developer Pyro Studios' first series entry, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines - which challenged players to guide a six-strong team of commandos, each with their own distinct abilities, behind enemy lines (the clue was very much in the title), to undertake the likes of sabotage and assassination missions while staying as sneaky as possible.


It's very good, if notoriously tough, and was followed by four more games: 1999's standalone expansion Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty, 2001's Commandos 2: Men of Courage (which introduced a 3D engine), 2003's Commandos 3: Destination Berlin, and 2006's Commandos: Strike Force - which re-imagined the series' formula in first-person.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has unveiled new "smaller" versions of its PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Digital consoles, which will launch this November in the US alongside an optional disc drive attachment for purchasers that wish to upgrade their digital-only machine at a later date.


The newly revealed console is said to mark a 30% decrease in volume compared to the previous PS5 model (and a weight reduction of 18% and 24% for the standard and digital edition respectively), and sports a design featuring two glossy panels on the top and two bottom panels that'll retain the matte look of the original machine.


The bottom left quadrant is where you'll find the new Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive attachment if you opt for the standard version of the machine. The digital-only version includes a removable panel that'll enable purchasers to add the drive - which costs an extra £99.99/€119.99/$79.99 USD - should they want a version capable of playing digital media at a later time.

Earlier today, Bandai Namco announced Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam). 
This revamped edition of the game will offer the same chaotic, chomp-tastic, 64-player shenanigans as its former Stadia exclusive days, but with the addition of new gameplay modes, music, customisation options and "enhanced visuals".

And sadly for those eager to hear more, this is seemingly not something we should expect to hear any time in the near future. Instead, Meta is remaining remarkably tight-lipped about the project it once said was "many years in the making".
At this year's Connect conference, Meta was asked for more news on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' VR release by both UploadVR and Road to VR. However, the responses were less than informative.

In summer 2020, allegations of sexual assault and harassment were made against a number of senior and veteran employees including Assassin's Creed Valhalla creative director Ashraf Ismail, Splinter Cell and Far Cry creative director Maxime Béland, and former editorial vice president Tommy François.
Speaking at GamesIndustry HR Summit last month, Ubisoft's chief people officer Annika Grant said the company is now "on the right path" following a number of changes implemented internally, as reported by GamesIndustry. Grant joined Ubisoft in 2021 when it was "navigating a misconduct crisis".

<blockquote><p>Polynomial Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Billions of dollars and countless GPU hours are currently spent on training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for a variety of tasks. Thus, it is essential to determine the difficulty of extracting all the parameters of such neural networks when given access to their black-box implementations. Many versions of this problem have been studied over the last 30 years, and the best current attack on ReLU-based deep neural networks was presented at Crypto&#8217;20 by Carlini, Jagielski, and Mironov. It resembles a differential chosen plaintext attack on a cryptosystem, which has a secret key embedded in its black-box implementation and requires a polynomial number of queries but an exponential amount of time (as a function of the number of neurons)...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

But while those inclusions expanded the map, there were some omissions as well. Most obviously, just where did all of that Sheikah tech, that was so instrumental to Breath of the Wild's story, go? And what happened to those spidery robot Guardians?


Well, according to Zelda director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, the various towers, Guardians, Divine Beasts and other Sheikah creations simply disappeared, with the general consensus in Hyrule being that as their purpose had been realised, the tech knew it was its time to go.

Jack Skellington from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is also joining Fortnite - I like that he also has his Santa Jack costume as well - alongside Halloween's Michael Myers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With all signs pointing to an imminent successful end for Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition saga, Activision has moved to address the issue of its titles appearing on Game Pass, saying not to expect that to happen until next year if the deal goes through.


To date, Activision titles have been notably absent from Game Pass, but the assumption has been that would change if Microsoft's $69bn bid for the Call of Duty publisher succeeded. And with the deal now anticipated to be finalised this week, assuming the UK's Competition and Markets Authority gives it the green light as is generally expected, questions around an Activision presence on Game Pass have shifted from 'if' to 'when'.


And the company has now addressed fan queries on social media, writing, "As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we've been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has announced the departure of its CEO John Riccitiello, just weeks after the company became mired in controversy following hugely unpopular changes to its engine pricing model.


At the end of last month, Unity announced sweeping changes to its Unity Engine business model that would force developers to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee every time their game was installed, on top of their existing licence subscription, after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash from the development community was immediate and intense, and Unity eventually announced significant changes to its initial plans - but by that point, the damage was done.


And now Unity has announced that John Riccitiello, the CEO who oversaw its reputationally devastating pricing changes, "will retire" from all his roles at the company - president, chief executive officer, chairman, and a member of its board of directors - effective immediately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam's Next Fest has returned for another week-long showcase of future releases, including developer livestreams, chats, and, of course, "hundreds" of playable demos.


Valve's latest Steam Next Fest is already underway and runs until 5.59pm BST/9.59am PST on Monday, 16th October. That means you've got just under seven full days at the time of writing to furiously claw your way through another bumper crop of playable demos before they potentially vanish once more into the ether.


We're well beyond the days when you could feasibly work your way through the entire list before the end of Next Fest (unless you're particularly determined and hate sleep, I suppose), but Valve has, at least, assembled a special event mini-site, splitting available demos down into mere easily perusable and digestible categories.

FOV (that's field-of-view if your abbreviation list isn't up to date) can now be adjusted in both first- and third-person perspective with the arrival of Starfield's 1.7.36 update, and that comes alongside a whopping three additional bullet points in Bethesda's patch notes.


The studio is also touting improved stability for PCs using Intel Arc GPUs, and there are some - entirely mysterious - stability and performance improvements promised for all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA's long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher's keen to let everyone know it's doing just fine without it - and has announced that this year's iteration, EA Sports FC 24, has reached 11.3m players in its first week of release.


That's compared to the 10.3m players that hopped into last year's FIFA 23 during the same period - a figure EA referred to as "record-breaking" and the "biggest launch period" in the franchise's history at the time.


EA Sports FC 24's 11.3m players would certainly suggest the series' success hasn't been hampered by the loss of the FIFA brand, then, but EA does note this year's figures include EA Play subscribers, so those numbers don't necessarily all equate to sales.

It's called Assassin's Focus, and it allows you to freeze time and paint a reticule over multiple enemies to teleport between them all and murder them in quick succession. It's like Red Dead Redemption's Quickdraw mode, except you're physically knifing people in the neck with every bullet.


At the beginning of Assassin's Creed Mirage, you can only pull off this effect with two enemies at a time, but with further upgrades you're able to expand this effect to quickly end a whole group of foes at once.

Hero Pass was described by Jagex as an "always-on reward system" and it was introduced into RuneScape last month. It was heavily criticised by players for pay-to-win elements such as XP buffs, which prompted Jagex to temporarily roll back the update shortly after Hero Pass launched.
Following feedback from a player survey, Jagex announced Hero Pass will end once the current season, Underworld, finishes on 4th December.

The report from German outlet Game Two was created after interviewing 32 former and current employees at Daedalic, as well as receiving statements from the company itself, on the development of Gollum.

However, this time she can only travel backwards and forwards.


It is a rather incredible recreation, and one that clearly has a lot of love attached to it. As I said in my headline, it is a brilliant tribute to a brilliant game.

Reading the headlines, one would hope that the rapid gains in AI technology have also brought forth a unifying realization of the risks&#8212;and the steps we need to take to mitigate them.</p>
<p>The reality, unfortunately, is quite different. Beneath almost all of the testimony, the manifestoes, the blog posts, and the public declarations issued about AI are battles among deeply divided factions. Some are concerned about far-future risks that sound like science fiction. Some are genuinely alarmed by the practical problems that chatbots and deepfake video generators are creating right now. Some are motivated by potential business revenue, others by national security concerns...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage might take Ubisoft's historical stabathon series back to basics, but there's a newer visual effect which players want rid of. 


The game's visual chromatic aberration effect is switched on by default and there's no way to turn it off - despite it being pronounced and sometimes quite distracting in certain areas. 


One of the first things I did when starting to play Mirage was look for some kind of slider or toggle to tune the effect (or just disable it completely). Alas, one does not exist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been playing Baldur's Gate 3, you're likely to have missed out on a companion or two - as making certain decisions can affect who's available. Heavy spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3 are included in this article.
One of the most missable companions is Minthara, who appears in Act 1 of the game. In normal circumstances, recruiting her means siding with the goblins and attacking Emerald Grove along with the refugee Tieflings that are staying there.
However, this comes with some significant consequences - Halsin will refuse to help you later on in the game, and Karlach will be unavailable as a companion. Unless you're Taiwanese player pao870111, who came up with a way to recruit Minthara in a morally good playthrough without the use of mods.

Known as The Last of Crust, this sculpture by One House Bakery was cooked up by mother daughter duo Catherine and Hannalee Pervan as part of the Downtown Benicia Main Street's annual Scarecrow Contest.
As reported by Eater San Francisco (via IGN), this event has also seen the skilled twosome come up with a range of Star Wars-themed crusty creations, with Pan Solo, Pain-dough-lorian, Baby Dough-da, and the Pandroid all gracing the competition in previous years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, it's not your imagination - yes, there is a cat in Assassin's Creed Mirage that has a very deliberate Assassin's Emblem on his snout.

Even more amazingly still, the cat isn't even a work of fiction created by the dev team. It turns out that a fan shared an image of the sweet kitty after he "recently crossed the rainbow bridge" and after bringing him to the attention of the team and offering "coffee and Timbits" to any dev prepared to immortalise the cat in the game, it seems Ubisoft did precisely that.

"Am I reaching at straws here or?" asked suckashelfboi101 on the game's subreddit, seeking assurances that they weren't just seeing things. "Is this cats face supposed to look like the Assassin Emblem or what because it’s all I can see. Maybe something the devs put in for fun?"
