        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forza Motorsport has reportedly been delayed from its previously announced "spring 2023" release date on Xbox Series X/S and PC to "Q3 maybe even a little bit later".


That's according to Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb, speaking during the latest episode of his Game Mess Decides podcast (thanks VGC). "I feel pretty good about this after asking around a couple of times after hearing it the first time earlier today," Grubb explained. "It does seem like Forza is going to slip later into the year and probably won't be the first half of the year...The timeframe I'm hearing for Forza is like Q3, and maybe even a little bit later than that."


Microsoft had initially given Forza Motorsport a "spring 2023" release window when it was announced in June last year. However, when the game re-emerged during this week's Developer Direct showcase, many were quick to notice that, rather than announcing a launch date, Microsoft had instead revised Forza Motorsport's release to a far broader "2023".

Geller first sued Nintendo in November 2000, claiming the spoon-bearing Kadabra - known as "Yungerer" or "Yungeller" in Japan - was an unauthorised appropriation of his identity. That initial California lawsuit was dismissed in 2003, but additional lawsuits reportedly continued outside the US, and Kadabra has remained absent from Pokémon: The Card Game since 2002.


Then, in 2020, Geller had a change of heart, dropping all remaining legal action and "giving [Nintendo] permission to relaunch the Uri Geller Kadabra/Yungeller worldwide." He also told fans, "I am truly sorry for what I did 20 years ago...I am releasing the ban. It's now all up to Nintendo bring my Kadabra Pokémon card back."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mushroom fans rejoice! HBO has confirmed its critically acclaimed live-action TV adaptation of The Last of Us will be returning for a second season.


It's perhaps not particularly surprising news; The Last of Us has proven both a critical and ratings smash since it premiered on 15th January. Shortly after the show's debut, HBO announced it had become the network's second most-watched premiere in over a decade, with 4.7m viewers tuning in for the first episode - a figure that's since quadrupled, garnering over 18m views in the space of a week. Episode 2, meanwhile, secured the largest week-two audience growth for an Original drama series in HBO's history. 


And now, just under three weeks into The Last of Us' first season, HBO has confirmed there's more on the way. "I'm so grateful to [The Last of Us co-creator] Neil Druckmann and HBO for our partnership," showrunner and series writer Craig Mazin said of the news, "and I'm even more grateful to the millions of people who have joined us on this journey".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042's long-awaited Class update, which rework's the beleaguered shooter's much-maligned Specialists system into something more closely resembling classes from previous Battlefield games, will launch next week, developer DICE has confirmed.


DICE announced it would be overhauling 2042's Specialists last August, saying feedback on the "polarising" system had highlighted concerns around "the loss of Class Identity, and a shift from familiar gameplay flow that [players] were used to."


As it previously explained, the goal of DICE's Class update is to give Specialists defined roles and an arsenal of gadgets, equipment, and weapon proficiencies suited to their specialisations. To that end, once 2042's 3.2 update arrives next week, players can choose from either Assault, Engineer, Recon, or Support. A far lengthier explanation of the upcoming changes can be found in DICE's blog post from last year.

This is, of course, a clever way for Sky and co. to keep generating interest and hype for the series. It did the same thing with its Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon, and will likely do the same thing with future shows down the line.


Even so, it is a great opportunity for fans of the games (or those totally new to the series) to get a little taster of what the The Last of Us TV team has been cooking up. So, without further ado, you can follow the link here to watch episode one of The Last of Us. Enjoy!

N64 players will remember the likes of DK mode, paintball mode, and the Aztec and Egyptian secret levels, which were unlocked by completing missions within difficulty and time limit conditions. Alternatively, they could be unlocked by inputting cheat codes.


However, while those cheat codes still work on the Switch version, they are not compatible with the Xbox version.

This news originated from Insider Gamer, but has since been corroborated by Kotaku. Sources state Ubisoft head Yves Guillemot referenced both of these upcoming Far Cry releases during an internal company update last week. 


Additionally, the same sources revealed that Far Cry 7 (known internally as Project Blackbird) is being made with Ubisoft's Snowdrop engine, which is the same engine being used for its Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game. Just as a general point of interest, the most recent entries in the Far Cry series used the Dunia engine.

However, somehow, the couple at the start of Fallout 4 manage to survive the game's opening nuclear blast, and remain unscathed by the heat flash that would have hit them (not to mention, those looking right at the blast would likely be blinded at the very least). 


So, while Fallout 4's introduction is certainly an impactful one, it is not exactly known for its realism. Well, that is, until now. Thanks to modders, we can now start a new game of Fallout 4... and not survive the introduction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hasbro is set to lay off approximately 1,000 people from its global workforce this year in an effort to cut costs, around 15 percent of global full-time employees.


This is to achieve its goal of delivering $250-300m in annualised run-rate cost savings by the end of 2025.


"The elimination of these positions will impact many loyal Hasbro employees, and we do not undertake this process lightly. However, the changes are necessary to return our business to a competitive, industry-leading position and to provide the foundation for future success," said CEO Chris Cocks.

On 24th January, Hotfix 6.3.0.5 was released but Bungie later announced it would be taking the game offline to "investigate an ongoing issue causing certain Triumphs, Seals, and Catalysts to lose progress for players", as per this tweet.



Now the game is back up and running, but players have lost progress in the process and purchases during this time have been refunded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motive has detailed the accessibility options for Dead Space. 


The remake, which was released today, has a variety of features that players can implement at their will. These include narratable menus, a range of subtitle options, controller customisation, five difficulty settings and a colourblind mode. You can see how many of these options look in the video embedded below. 


In addition to these features, the Dead Space developer has also added an optional content warning feature. With this feature in use, players will be informed about any upcoming in-game content that they could find upsetting. This is done "by displaying a non-intrusive popup that gives a brief description of the type of event that's waiting around the corner, or in an audio or video log before you play it" (see header image above).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Road 96, the acclaimed narrative adventure from developer Digixart, is getting a prequel, and it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 4th April.


As a quick refresher, the original Road 96 served up  procedural road trip adventure - set during a long, hot summer in the mid-90s - in which players hitchhiked across the ever-changing authoritarian nation of Petria in an attempt to reach the border and start a new life. We liked it a lot at Eurogamer, awarding it a Recommended badge.


Its newly announced prequel, officially titled Road 96: Mile 0, rewinds the clock just a little bit further to tell a tale set just prior to the events of the first game. This time, players can explore White Sands, described as Petria's only luxurious community, switching between protagonists Zoe and Kaito - two teenagers from significantly different backgrounds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Fntastic has rebuffed suggestions from increasingly vocal detractors that The Day Before - its now twice-delayed and seldom seen open-world zombie survival MMO - is a scam, saying, "When the game comes out, people will finally see the truth."


The Day Before was revealed back in 2021, with a striking trailer that helped propel it to the top of  Steam's most wishlisted games chart. Since then, though, its journey to release has been less than smooth. Its initial June 2022 release date was delayed by a year when Fntastic suddenly announced it was switching development to Unreal Engine 5 less than a month before its planned arrival, then earlier this week, with just two months to go before its revised launch date, the developer pulled the game's Steam listing and announced another delay - pushing its release back a further nine months, this time blaming a trademark dispute.


Throughout all this, very little has actually been seen of The Day Before beyond its initial announcement trailer, a 13-minute gameplay video revealed several months later, and 59-seconds of additional gameplay at the start of this year. All of which has lead to a rise in suggestions around the internet the game may not even be in development at all.

The original Pharaoh, which released in the hazy mists of 1999, gave players the opportunity whizz back through time and participate in 15 centuries of Ancient Egyptian history, coaxing their fledging nomad settlements into bustling cities in classic management sim style.


At first it's just a matter of constructing a  logistically sound network of housing, roads, and simple amenities to satisfy citizens' needs, but soon considerations around the likes of economy, trade, health, agriculture, education, culture, religion, and warfare come into play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann has stated the studio is "moving on" from Uncharted, and it could do the same with The Last of Us if it doesn't have a "compelling" enough story to tell for Part 3. 


In an interview with BuzzFeed, the developer acknowledged fans are eager to hear more about the prospect of a third story in its The Last of Us series. However, Druckmann was keen to stress that just because something is successful, it doesn't necessarily mean it needs a sequel.


Druckmann stated Naughty Dog is in a "very privileged position" with Sony, with the publisher "[supporting the studio] every step of the way to follow [its] passions", meaning it wasn't feeling any pressure to make a sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision is making significant changes to Warzone 2.0, and a lot of it sounds like going back to Warzone 1.


While Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 enjoyed a massive launch late last year, player dissatisfaction has grown since then. While we don't have concurrent player numbers on console, according to SteamDB, Modern Warfare 2 player numbers have dropped off steadily following a peak in early November.


In a blog post, Activision outlined what changes Warzone 2.0 players can expect when Season 2 launches on 15th February.

However, just six months down the road, its stock is dropping and then dropping some more. 


In fact, at the time of writing, its stock is sitting at $0.75 per share (see header above).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 launched with a user interface that was widely panned by players. With the launch of Season 2 on 15th February, Activision hopes that sentiment will change.


The interface used to navigate between Modern Warfare 2, Warzone 2.0 and DMZ is a tile interface some have compared to Netflix or Hulu.

Perhaps worse than that is the in-game menu system, which makes it difficult to work out where you are or where you're meant to go to get to what you want.

The Dead Space team has kept details on this new mode fairly brief so far, but has confirmed it will come with a Level 6 Advanced Suit (nice), New Phantom Variant Necromorphs (scary) and, perhaps most interestingly, a secret ending (ooh).


This secret ending will more than likely link to the "Reunion" trophy that Vikki reported on last week. To get this achievement, players will need to "see the alternative ending on any difficulty mode".

That'll soon be joined by the legendary GoldenEye 007, which gets a gentle spruce-up for Cloud and Xbox on 27th January, 


Next up are the Game Preview version of rogue-lite first-person shooter Roboquest (coming to Xbox on 30th January), plus Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition - which gets a long-awaited console release, complete with controller support and new tutorials, on 31st January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has reportedly added loot boxes to the latest playtest build of its highly-anticipated new Skate project, tying them to earnable in-game currency in a manner seemingly consistent with its previous promise of there being no paid loot boxes in the game.


EA made that particular pledge last July, when it announced its Skate revival would be a free-to-play live-service game. At the time, developer Full Circle attempted to assuage fan fears by insisting the game's monetisation would be "mostly about cosmetics and convenience", promising no pay to win mechanics or paid gameplay advantages, no paid gameplay elements or areas of the map, and no paid loot boxes.


Given those assurances, players were a little perturbed when, not long after Skate's free-to-play announcement, dataminers uncovered evidence of loot-box-like Swag Bags - purchasable with "Taps" and containing randomised apparel - in a version of Skate's playtest source code.

The show gave us a lot of what we'd expected, all that had leaked and, well, no surprises, really. Here are all the announcements, trailers and news Microsoft had to offer.
Developer Direct kicked off with a look at Minecraft spin-off Minecraft Legends and its PVP experience. It's out 18th April 2023 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S and of course, Game Pass. Here's Tom's Minecraft Legends preview, if you want to know more. The new trailer is below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a bit of a leak ahead of Microsoft's Developer Direct showcase, Tango Gameworks has formally unveiled its latest project, Hi-Fi Rush - a rather glorious-looking rhythm adventure that's getting a surprise release today on Xbox, PC, and Game Pass.


Hi-Fi Rush - which follows the eye-searingly colourful escapades of wannabe rockstar Chai and his pet cat - is quite the departure from Tango's largely horror-focused previous output (which includes the likes of The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo), trading spooks for something considerably more exuberant.


Calling to mind some of Sega's classics (Eurogamer's Martin Robinson excitedly described it as "PNO3 meets Jet Set Radio Future" at one point during its unveiling this evening), Hi-Fi Rush is a rail-swinging, robot-pummelling adventure that all unfolds to the rhythm of its music.

We saw footage of a player battling a "Shroud" vampire which cloaks the local area in darkness, giving the appearance of a more arena-style fight in close quarters.

In Minecraft Legends, PVP is a cross-platform affair for up to eight players, split into two teams. Each team's objective is to capture and destroy their opponent's base, while building up defences around their own. 


As in the main Legends campaign, PVP areas are procedurally generated - a nod back to the vanilla Minecraft. Also included are the Piglins, PVE enemies who act as a third faction intent on frustrating both sides.

While multiplayer is perhaps the most notable (and intriguing) addition for Disney Dreamlight Valley in 2023, there's little to report until Gameloft is ready to say more than just that single word. Thankfully, the rest of its roadmap is more illuminating, starting with the fact the early access game's next update is scheduled to arrive in February.


This introduces an "exceptionally unexceptional" new villager - revealed to be Encanto's Mirabel Madrigal in the accompanying picture - plus a "special snowman" linked to new secrets in the Frosted Heights biome. And if that's not pointing to Frozen's Olaf then I'm all out of ideas.

There's a new format from Microsoft tonight that might be kind of familiar given the name, and it promises fresh looks at Redfall, Elder Scrolls Online, Minecraft Legends and - you can probably tell this is the one I'm most excited for - the rebooted Forza Motorsport. There should be a little more besides, too, going from recent leaks - so join us from 8pm GMT for all the fun!

Those playing through Nintendo's service will have access to its single-player campaign - that takes us from the snow covered vistas of its 'Surface' levels to the lush jungle of, well, its 'Jungle' level - and also be able to take part in its multiplayer both locally and online.


Those on Xbox, meanwhile, will have access to the campaign and its four-player split screen multiplayer. This is an updated version of GoldenEye 007 for Xbox consoles, and will include achievements, 4K resolution, a smoother framerate and alternative control options. In short, I know what I am doing on Friday night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a record breaking Q1 last year, Microsoft has announced a 13% drop in Xbox gaming revenue for its latest quarter, but says that Game Pass has reached "new highs".


In its latest earnings report covering the current financial year's second quarter, ending 31st December 2022, Microsoft confirmed a 13% reduction in gaming revenue compared to the same quarter last year (thanks Windows Central), highlighting declines in first-party content and lower monetisation in third-party content.


It also noted a 12% decrease in revenue from Xbox content and services, alongside a 13% reduction in Xbox hardware revenue - although all drops were largely in line with previous expectations, with the reduction attributed to a strong prior year in FY22 Q2. That quarter saw Microsoft launch Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, and Age of Empires compared to its most recent quarter, where Xbox's sole first-party title was Obsidian Entertainment's Pentiment.

When Darktide launched on PC in November, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell applauded its "stupendous atmosphere and vicious action" in his review, but called its release "scrappy [and] rickety...arriving with bugs and technical difficulties and making huge demands of PCs".


Issues around Darktide's launch have coalesced to the point it's now accrued a damning 'mostly negative' recent reviews rating on Steam from nearly 8,500 players, and Fatshark has moved to acknowledge the community's mounting frustration in a statement shared on Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mimimi Games, the studio behind the superb Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blade of the Shogun, has unveiled its latest foray into the world of stealth-strategy: zombie pirate adventure Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew.


Shadow Gambit, which unfolds in an alternative Golden Age of Piracy, sees players setting sail across the Caribbean in a living ghost ship known as The Red Marley. Along the way, they'll assemble a crew of cursed pirates with supernatural powers - all of which should come in handy in the fight against the Inquisition of the Burning Maiden and the hunt for the treasure of the legendary Captain Mordechai.


It's a top-down tactical adventure set in a "dynamic, immersive sandbox", with players able to freely choose the islands they visit and the missions they tackle from their hub-like ship. Entry and exit points on islands can be established ahead of time, and different crew mates can be taken into battle, depending how players want to approach the challenges ahead.

Riot first shared news of the attack - said to have targeted its development environment - last Friday, saying that while the incident would temporarily affect its ability to release content, there was "no indication that player data or personal information was obtained."


The studio has now reiterated that point in an update on Twitter, saying it "remains confident" no player data was impacted. It also revealed further information on the attack, saying that - following the 'exfiltration' of source code for League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, and a "legacy anticheat platform" - the perpetrators have now contacted Riot in a ransom email. "Needless to say," it added, "we won't pay."

It received a more mixed reception than the series' first game, which featured high school time travel antics and a different set of characters. But for those who are still yet to play Life is Strange 2, it is still worth a look.

In Nacon's latest earnings report, the publisher stated the game will now release in the first half of FY 2023-24. This means we are looking at some time between April and September this year. For those keeping track, this  means Gollum has been delayed yet again.


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been a long time coming. While it was initially meant to release in 2021, its launch has seen several setbacks and delays. Most recently, we were told its once-expected September 2022 launch was getting pushed back to an unspecified date in 2023, but only by a "few months". However, since then all has been quiet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space hero Isaac Clarke is now available to play as in Fortnite, ahead of his appearance in the franchise's upcoming remake which launches this Friday.


Clarke comes with a handy health-tracking back bling that reacts to Isaac taking damage - just as in the survival horror series. You can also own the engineer's plasma cutter as a pickaxe, and equip a dinky model of the necromorph-ridden USG Ishimura.


If you fancy adding Isaac to your Fortnite locker, his set of items comes priced at £9.99, with 1500 V-Bucks of in-game Fortnite currency included. 1500 V-Bucks is also typically worth £9.99, so you're basically paying up for those and getting the skin as an added freebie. (Yes, I did buy it from Fortnite's in-game store last night.)

While there are several options for players to choose from throughout the game that in turn curate different experiences for different players (for example, starting off on either the Nomad, Street Kid, or Corpo lifepaths or its five different endings), many felt Cyberpunk 2077 should have given more - especially given how much was promised ahead of the game's release. 


Sasko, chatting on his Twitch channel (via PCGamesN) was asked by one viewer, "How do you feel about players criticising the game for being linear?" To this, the developer replied that it was "completely justified", before elaborating further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early designs of Sonic the Hedgehog have been shared by original designer Naoto Ohshima, revealing Sonic began life as a child with spiky blue hair.


As Ohshima explains in his tweet, he made a draft of an action game about twin brothers who "protect the dream world from Nightmare World's boss" called Thirteen - a concept which later evolved into Sonic.


The twin brothers themselves have spiky hair - one red and one blue - while the environment features a very familiar looking loop de loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French unions representing Ubisoft Paris staff are pushing ahead with plans for an employee walkout, with a date of this Friday, 27th January now set. 


The call to strike comes in response to ongoing discontent at the publisher, inflamed this month by comments from Ubisoft's CEO Yves Guillemot following a round of troubling financial results.


Two unions, the video game workers' union (STJV) and digital technology union Solidaires Informatique, have now called on employees at Ubisoft's Parisian headquarters to strike this week, French newspaper Libération reported today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft Classic lead Brian Birmingham has parted ways with Blizzard after voicing concerns about the company's "forced" stack-ranking policy.


The policy in question reportedly states managers at Blizzard are obliged to give a low "Developing" rating - something that could impact an employees financial status and future promotion potential - to a certain percentage of its staff in order to meet a quota laid out by parent company Activision Blizzard.


In an email seen by Bloomberg, Birmingham stated when Blizzard team leads questioned this policy, the "World of Warcraft directors explained that while they did not agree, the reasons given by executive leadership were that it was important to squeeze the bottom-most performers as a way to make sure everybody continues to grow".

It means Sony may be forced to reveal confidential information on its future plans it would likely prefer to keep quiet.


The subpoena was issued on 17th January with a response date of 20th January, though this has been extended until 27th January for Sony to "move to limit or quash or otherwise respond to the subpoena".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following HBO's announcement last week that The Last of Us was its second most-watched premiere in over a decade, the broadcaster has revealed that Episode 2 secured the largest week-two audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in its history.


As reported by Variety, a combination of official figures and data gathered by Nielsen points to a viewership of 5.7 million on HBO and HBO Max for The Last of Us' second episode, which marks a 22% increase on the premiere's 4.7m viewers. That number, obviously, does not factor in audience figures outside the US.


HBO has previously said Sunday night viewership for one of its shows typically represents 20-40% of an episode's gross audience, meaning its latest Episode 2 figures are likely to grow substantially. Episode 1, for instance, has now nearly quadrupled its initial audience, securing over 18m views in the space of a week.

Cosmic Smash, which initially launched back in 2001, saw players traversing a futuristic subway-style map, with each "stop" on the line challenging them to clear blocks at the end of a long room within a time limit, using a ball and racquet - making for an experience somewhere between Breakout and squash.


And now, after a 22-year absence, it looks like Cosmic Smash is making a return. Sega released a teaser - along with the words "eye c sth forming" - on its social media channels earlier today, all pointing to a website with "csmashvrs" in its URL.

Build is the SteamWorld series' first 3D outing and challenges players to construct a city while also sending their workers to explore foe-packed mines below ground in order to keep a steady supply of building resources incoming.


Thunderful says there'll be a narrative component to the whole thing - the ultimate goal is to build a rocket to escape the planet before it shatters (events in Build run concurrently to those in SteamWorld Dig 2) - and you can get a closer look at its intriguing action in the studio's announcement livestream, as well as in Christian Donlan's very encouraging initial impressions.

There have been reports of users having their accounts corrupted or blocked, as well as stats being removed and reversed in the game, due to the actions of opportunistic cheaters.


These security vulnerabilities have been picked up on by the prolific Rockstar Games-focused account Tez2 (via PCGamer). 
The user states it is essential PC players only play GTA Online with a firewall rule in place (they recommend Speyedr's Guardian) to protect their game. Or, better still, avoid playing all together until these issues are resolved by Rocksar.

Sony's recent PlayStation 5 re-release shot back into the UK boxed game chart top 20, with a 238 percent rise in copies sold versus the week before (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz).


It wasn't enough to trouble last week's new launch from Nintendo, Fire Emblem Engage, but it is worth noting that this sales data does not include digital downloads. It's likely that many more copies of The Last of Us will have been shifted digitally, whereas Nintendo's own releases typically skew more towards boxed copies.

Walters publicly confirmed his departure over the weekend, after more than 19 years at the company. Beginning as a writer on Jade Empire, Walters took a more senior role on the original Mass Effect, before serving as lead writer for the trilogy's second and third installments. 


"With a new year comes new adventures," Walters wrote in a post on LinkedIn. "As some of you already know, at the end of last year I decided to leave BioWare. These past 19 years have been a life-changing experience to say the least, and it made the choice to go very difficult."

Publisher Cygames announced Granblue Fantasy: Relink in August 2016 as an ambitious co-production with Bayonetta developer PlatinumGames. But in February 2019, Cygames announced it had ditched Platinum and would handle development itself.


In December 2020, Cygames announced a 2022 release window for the PlayStation 5 as well as the PlayStation 4. Obviously that didn't pan out, with the delay blamed on the pandemic. A 2023 release window was announced in its stead.

We last saw Ellie and Joel, along with Anna Torv's Tess, fleeing FEDRA soldiers patrolling the QZ. As they ran off into the darkness, the unmistakable noise of a clicker could be heard reverberating through the ruined city, giving us a haunting sense for what's to come.

After a little back and fore between Polish outlet Parkiet and CDPR's communications team to clarify whether "biggest" referred to the game's budget or scope, it's now been confirmed to be the former.

This was further emphasised by community director Marcin Morton on the game's Reddit community - "this [...] is about the biggest budget when it comes to expansion packs we've released" - and then again by global PR director Radek Grabowski, who tweeted to confirm the team meant that it was the biggest DLC by budget, not necessarily in-game content.

Whilst not formally confirmed by EA nor the development team at Motive, according to the game's lightly spoilery trophy list - which have recently gone up on True Trophies (thanks, TheGamer) - you can unlock a trophy called "Reunion", an achievement that pops when you "see the alternative ending on any difficulty mode".

Unsurprisingly, we're not told anything else about the alternate ending or what it entails, but it should be exciting news for OG Dead Space fans who may recall that no such achievement was available in the original game.

Striking Distance Studios announced the new feature in its latest patch notes, confirming that as part of its v.3.01 patch, players who kick off a new game on a completed game save will be able to access all their weapons, upgrades, and outstanding Callisto Credits when they first visit a Reforge.

The feature is now live on PC and consoles, along with the usual bug squishes and tweaks to improve performance and resolve issues. In fact, "general optimisations across all platforms" have been deployed, along with a fix to the "The Protocol is About Life" achievement that had not been popping for all players.

The letter - which has been sent out to media and ESO streamers - is signed by Leramil the Wise and addresses the recipient as "proxy". And whilst there's nothing on the letter or envelope that identifies the game or developer by name, fans have been quick to put the pieces together.

"Proxy," the letter begins. "The tide of fate swirls around you with glorious fury and has chosen you to serve as its surrogate in a crisis most perilous. The future of at least two worlds hands in the balance. Your talent for changing destiny has been noticed, hence the reason for this letter.

Whilst not confirmed formally by Rime developer Tequila Works, a tweet on the studio's official Twitter channel posted cover art from the game with the word "soon".

Back in October - when Google confirmed plans to shutter its cloud gaming service Stadia, which closed down earlier this week - Tequila Works confirmed its formerly Stadia-exclusive action-adventure Gylt would be going multiplatform next year. But whilst we knew it was coming to other systems, the studio had said very little else… until now, anyway.

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hacking is something that the rich and powerful do, something that reinforces existing power structures,&#8221; contends security technologist Schneier (<i>Click Here to Kill Everybody</i>) in this excellent survey of exploitation. Taking a broad understanding of hacking as an &#8220;activity allowed by the system that subverts the&#8230; system,&#8221; Schneier draws on his background analyzing weaknesses in cybersecurity to examine how those with power take advantage of financial, legal, political, and cognitive systems. He decries how venture capitalists “hack” market dynamics by subverting the pressures of supply and demand, noting that venture capital has kept Uber afloat despite the company having not yet turned a profit. Legal loopholes constitute another form of hacking, Schneier suggests, discussing how the inability of tribal courts to try non-Native individuals means that many sexual assaults of Native American women go unprosecuted because they were committed by non-Native American men. Schneier outlines strategies used by corporations to capitalize on neural processes and &#8220;hack&#8230; our attention circuits,&#8221; pointing out how Facebook&#8217;s algorithms boost content that outrages users because doing so increases engagement. Elegantly probing the mechanics of exploitation, Schneier makes a persuasive case that &#8220;we need society&#8217;s rules and laws to be as patchable as your computer.&#8221; With lessons that extend far beyond the tech world, this has much to offer...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

That's according to reliable Marvel's Avengers leaker Miller Ross, who, citing sources at Crystal Dynamics in a story for Exputer, says the studio had initially intended to continue supporting the game into the back half of 2023, but recent events surrounding lead developer Brian Waggoner - who has reportedly now left the company after he was found to have posted racist, ableist, and homophobic tweets - has accelerated the project's demise.


Ross' sources say Waggoner will not be replaced following his departure, leaving only a "small team" of developers still working on Marvel's Avengers, most of whom are already sharing their time with other Crystal Dynamics projects, including Amazon's Tomb Raider.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition launches physically across Europe and North America on 26th January, bundling together the acclaimed base game and its previously released DLC - including expansions Heart of Stone & Blood and Wine, plus 16 bits of additional content. It also features all quality of life improvements and extras added in December's next-gen update, including a new quest, quick Sign casting, a photo mode, new camera options, cross-platform progression, and more.


Unsurprisingly, the update's next-gen bells and whistles make the transition to disc too, introducing the likes of faster loading times, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution support, and a choice between Performance and Ray Tracing modes on Xbox Series X and PS5.

Indeed, Destiny developer Bungie is in the process of contacting former Stadia players to offer a month's access to GeForce Now, Nvidia's rival cloud gaming platform which is still very much alive. 


Did you ever play Destiny 2 via Stadia? If so, it may be worth double-checking your inbox today for a voucher code to use GeForce Now for 30 days. The offer will expire on 19th February, 9to5Google reported today.

Employees were informed of the redundancies this morning via email, in a message from Google and Alphabet boss Sundar Pichai that was also posted to the company's blog. 


Titled "A difficult decision to set us up for the future", the post blamed the job losses on "difficult economic cycles". Google previously hired staff based on the "dramatic growth" it had seen over the past two years, Pichai  stated, which now did not reflect the "economic reality" today.

Katrina Leonoudakis worked on the games at Sega until her departure from the company, and said she had urged the publisher to ensure the games' translation team made it into the game's credits. 


"I am absolutely outraged. I was the Localisation Coordinator on the project up until I left Sega, constantly in connection with the FIGS teams," Leonoudakis wrote on Twitter last night. "I told the team who took over for me to credit the FIGS team. They worked incredibly hard to localise TWO GAMES. Unbelievable.

Details of planned revisions for an OGL 1.1 were leaked by Gizmodo, and Wizards of the Coast was immediately faced with an orchestrated pushback by fans and prominent community members over rule changes which would, among other things, require anyone making money through the use of D&D elements to report earnings to the company.


The original OGL, which was to be rendered "unauthorised" after the release of 1.1 according to Gizmodo's report, granted non-Wizards of the Coast publishers relative free rein over the use and sale of content which utilised D&D's existing elements.

This post warns Devops from a false sense of security. Following security best practices when developing and configuring microservices do not result in non-vulnerable microservices. The post shows that although all deployed microservices are vulnerable, there is much that can be done to ensure microservices are not exploited. It explains how analyzing the behavior of clients and services from a security standpoint, named here "Security-Behavior Analysis", can protect the deployed vulnerable microservices.

Endless Dungeon, which was announced toward the end of 2020, shipwrecks players on a mysterious space station and tasks them with recruiting a team of heroes in an effort to transport a crystal to their vessel's core, protecting it - via some frenetic top-down twin-stick shooting action - from ceaseless waves of monsters along the way.


It features a new storyline set in the Endless universe, and can be played either solo - one player controlling the entire squad - or alongside friends in multiplayer, with available heroes including Comrade (Gunsmith), Bunker (Tank), Blaze (Artificer), and Shroom (Medic).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After its year-long delay, EA Sports PGA Tour finally has a release date, and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 24th March.


EA Sports PGA Tour - which marks the publisher's first golfing sims since 2015's Rory McIlroy PGA Tour - was officially unveiled back in March 2021, with an anticipated launch window of "spring 2022". However, in March last year, EA made the decision to push its release back an entire 12 months, although no reason was given at the time.


With its launch now in sight, however, EA's PR machine is back in action, and today's release date news is accompanied by a brand-new trailer highlighting EA Sports PGA Tour's new Pure Strike shot system, which the publisher says incorporates 'fluid swing mechanics, innovative ball behaviour, and lifelike course dynamics'.

At launch back in December, Midnight Suns featured a 12-strong base game roster of playable heroes, consisting of Blade, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Hulk, Iron Man, Magik, Nico Minoru, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, and Wolverine.


However, publisher 2K confirmed shortly before release that Midnight Suns' line-up would begin to expand in early 2023, when Deadpool arrived in the first of four planned post-launch DLC packs. That pack has now been given an official name - The Good, The Bad, and The Undead - the aforementioned 26th January release date, plus more details on what it'll include.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[December brought the surprise news that Dead Cells - the superb rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire - would be joining forces with Konami to release a paid Castlevania expansion, and we've now been given a first proper (if rather brief) look at its retro-inspired action courtesy of a first gameplay trailer.


Previously described by Evil Empire as "our very own love letter to the granddad of Dead Cells", Return to Castelvania - as the expansion is officially known - will usher in two new biomes inspired by the Konami platforming classic, taking to players through the spooky outskirts and candle-lit interior of Dracula's Castle.


As they journey deeper into Vlad's pad, brave adventurers will face enemies from all across the Castlevania series, including mermen, bone throwers, haunted armour and, as one of three bosses to grace the DLC, Dracula himself. Thankfully, there's a whole new arsenal of familiar weapons to experiment with, ranging from the Vampire Killer and Throwing Axe to Holy Water.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a little over a month to go until the release of PlayStation 5's spruced-up virtual reality kit, PSVR 2, Sony has revealed the full 37-game launch window line-up players can expect to arrie between 22nd February and the end of March.


That list has steadily been growing since PSVR 2's official unveiling late last year, and today brings news of 13 previously unannounced additions. These newcomers include GoodbyeWorld Games' Before Your Eyes - an "emotional" adventure in which players control the narrative through a world of memories by blinking - and Kayak VR: Mirage, giving players the opportunity to paddle through ice caves in Antarctica, accompany dolphins in Costa Rica, survive a thunderstorm in Norway, and roam canyons in Australia.


These are joined by Pavlov VR - which makes the jump from PC with "realistic weapon interactions and attachments", plus competitive and social game modes - plus Puzzling Places, a "relaxing and wholesome" 3D jigsaw puzzler featuring "hyper-realistic miniatures of beautiful places from around the globe."

Conducted by Leon Y Xiao in co-operation with universities in Denmark, London and the US, the study examines a randomised selection of smartphone games which have loot boxes and are available to download from the Google Play Store. The study aimed to find out how consistent loot box presence warnings are across PEGI and the ERSB, as well as the consistency of age ratings on the Google Play Store as overseen by the IARC.
In August last year, Xiao looked into the implementation of Belgium's loot box ban, and concluded that the country's legislation had proved ineffective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetEase staff have smashed up a giant World of Warcraft statue by their studio, as the ongoing and increasingly bitter dispute between it and Activision Blizzard continues.


Earlier this week, Activision Blizzard revealed it was now seeking a new Chinese publisher as its current deal with NetEase, its long-standing local operator in the country, concludes this month in a war of words - and now hammers. Controversially, Activision Blizzard claimed it had offered NetEase a six-month extension to its contract - and said it was a "pity" NetEase had not taken up its offer.

In response, staff at NetEase have seemingly made their feelings clear - by taking mallets to a large World of Warcraft sculpture and tearing it down, before sipping on NetEase-branded drinks. The event was even livestreamed on social media to some 30,000 people, according to a report by WOWHead.

This is part of our normal course of our business: We periodically make changes to our structure and our teams based on what we believe will allow us to deliver the best content and experiences for players," reads a statement from Riot to Eurogamer.
"We never make these decisions lightly and will always start from a place of wanting to retain Rioters and have them focus on our highest priorities. While that's not always possible, it's our primary goal."

In a new post about the game's opening, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann stated the begining of The Last of Us was "one of the last things" the team finalised ahead of its release. This was because of these initial plans for you to play as Joel from the off.


The team ultimately decided this idea felt too similar to other games from the same genre, and it wanted to set The Last of Us apart from the rest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon are banned across a sizable swathe of Cyprus. There isn't a physical wall to keep them out - at least not in most areas. But in Pokémon Go a large area across the width of the Mediterranean island is still a Pokémon no-Go area, thanks to the country's past.


Before being contacted by Pokémon Go players based in Cyprus, I admit to being pretty ignorant of the island's recent history, and how its geography remains shaped by the after-effects of the country's 1974 Greek-backed coup and subsequent Turkish-led invasion. 


History lesson aside, the country remains divided by a United Nations Buffer Zone, a red ribbon on maps that cuts across the middle of the country. The internationally unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus lies to the north, while in the south sits the island's larger Greek Cypriot-dominated region. Between the two sits the Buffer Zone - an area which on paper sounds like a hazard, but in reality is home to 10,000 people - where Pokémon cannot spawn naturally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us made its TV debut earlier this week, with reception so far praising the show for its faithful adaptation of the game it is based on. 


However, there are some areas of the show that deviate slightly from Naughty Dog's original telling of Joel and Ellie's story. The most notable of these, which was announced ahead of the show's release, was that there would no longer be spores spreading the Cordyceps infection. 


Now, upcoming dialogue between Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie (shared as part of the BBC's audio review of the series) has revealed another way the virus can spread in the show. Please note, the below contains spoilers for The Last of Us.

Announced in September, the shutdown was scheduled for 7:59am 19th January for us Brits, or 11:59pm 18th January Pacific Time. If you head to the Stadia website now, you'll be greeted with a short message which reads: "Thank you for playing with us. Stadia was shut down on January 18, 2023."
Some players commemorated the occasion by livestreaming their final moments on the service which, although somewhat anticlimactic, marked the end of Stadia's short and troubled lifetime.

Last week, Ubisoft announced it had cancelled three "unannounced" titles and delayed its vapourware pirate ship game Skull and Bones yet again, on top of the four projects it previously abandoned last summer. 


Now, Eurogamer can confirm that Project Q was one of the games that Ubisoft most recently ditched.

Staten will remain at Microsoft but is no longer at its Halo studio 343 Industries, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier stated last night, after joining the company to ensure the beleaguered Halo Infinite made it out the door.


Last night, reports indicated that Microsoft's enormous round of layoffs would impact several Xbox studios, with 343's Halo Infinite campaign team in particular "hit hard", according to Schreier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, developer Respawn published a blog post pulling the curtain back on Apex Legends skill-based matchmaking, or SBMM. In the blog post, technical director Samy Duc dives deep into the inner workings of the battle royale's matchmaking system, explaining in granular detail why players end up facing the players they do. It's a fascinating exploration of one of the key features of any competitive multiplayer game, and Apex Legends players have certainly enjoyed the transparency.


As a Call of Duty player, I couldn't help but look at Respawn's blog post and wish Activision would do something similar.


Call of Duty SBMM has been a topic of discussion for years, and with each new release in the series, the same vociferous back-and-forth emerges. I've reported on COD SBMM numerous times, usually when players get so disgruntled with it that they start to play the game in silly ways, such as deliberately losing in a bid to matchmake against lower-skilled players in subsequent lobbies. Activision has always taken a dim view of third-party websites and apps that let players try to game the system, too.

Additional bathroom clutter comes courtesy of The Sims 4's sensibly titled Bathroom Clutter Kit, which promises to embrace the "mess of daily life". It's not all about chaos though; EA says to expect everything from "cute wall decals for kids to grandma's dentures", with enough scope among its addition to create an "elegant retreat" as well as an untameable toiletry explosions.


"Whether you want to leave makeup and combs scattered on the counter or give your Sims some additional drawers to keep them tidy," it explains, "the choice is yours with this collection, featuring bathroom decor for all ages."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has reportedly apologised for telling employees 'the ball was in their court' following disappointing financial results in the company's most recent quarter. However, senior management is also said to have rejected calls - highlighted in a recent union statement - for inflation-matching pay rises and a transition to a four-day week.


Guillemot's controversial comments to Ubisoft staff came in an email last week, when he wrote, "Today more than ever, I need your full energy and commitment to ensure we get back on the path to success. I am also asking that each of you be especially careful and strategic with your spending and initiatives, to ensure we're being as efficient and lean as possible. The ball is in your court to deliver this line-up on time and at the expected level of quality, and show everyone what we are capable of achieving."


Guillemot is said to have addressed his choice of words - which many saw as a shifting of blame for Ubisoft's recent troubles onto employees - during a company-wide Q&A session held earlier today, as reported by Kotaku citing sources present during the meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FuturLab's marvellous hose-'em-up PowerWash Simulator has set its sights on a new target in need of a clean, this time whisking players away to the world of Tomb Raider as part of a free update coming to PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch on 31st January.


PowerWash Simulator, if you're unfamiliar, arms players with assorted pumps, nozzles, and climbing equipment then sets them loose across a broad selection of scruffy environments in need of a good clean - from fire stations and treehouses to subterranean public loos. It's weirdly, wonderfully satisfying stuff, and surprisingly relaxing too.


PowerWash Simulator's incoming crossover, officially titled the Tomb Raider Special Pack, gives players access to five new levels in as part of a new mini-campaign, including a sprawling version of Croft Manor so utterly filthy, it's hard not to wonder what Lara's been up to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves is gearing up for a 2023 that'll see it celebrating five years of pirate adventure out on the waves, but before all that, it's hoisting anchor and setting sail with a mid-season update bringing pet rocks, a new limited-time adventure, and more.


Starting with that "and more", a major chunk of Sea of Thieves' new update - which arrives tomorrow, 19th January - is dedicated to improving the matchmaking system introduced as part of the game's new on-demand PvP functionality at the end of last year.


Eye-wateringly long wait times have been a major complaint since the feature's arrival in Season 8, and Rare is looking to remedy the issue by, firstly, allowing same-faction battles when matchmaking is taking to long. It's also introducing what it calls "cross-stamp migration" to make it easier for players to be paired. Some additional information on the changes can be found in a dev blog from December.

This interview resurfaced last night via Twitter, as translated by user gosokkyu, which has brought Takahashi's long-lost comments to light.

The issue? Marvel's Avengers already has a Marvel Cinematic Universe-inspired Thor with a helmet on, while this is being sold separately and for a relatively substantial amount of money. 


On his own, helmetless MCU Thor costs 1400 Credits (around $14), or comes at 500 Credits (around $5) if you already own the helmeted version (thanks, ComingSoon).

Of no real surprise, FIFA once again dominated in Europe, with FIFA 23 securing pole position on both consoles. Over in the US and Canada, however, big balls were swapped for big guns, as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 took the lead across both platforms.


God of War Ragnarök was also, unsurprisingly, a big winner on PlayStation 5, coming in as the third biggest download of 2022 in Europe (after Modern Warfare 2) and the second biggest download in the US/Canada. It was way down the PS4 list, however, scoring 9th place in the US/Canada and 15th place in Europe.

"For countless ages," says Paradox in a bout of scene-setting, "your people have looked to the stars with wonder - is there anybody else out there? When we meet, will they be friends or enemies? Will we be the ones to discover them, or are they already here, hiding in plain sight?".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anno 1800, Ubisoft's superb Industrial-Revolution-era city builder, is making the jump from PC to Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 on 16th March.


Anno 1800's launch on current-gen systems will mark the first time in the series' 25-year history that a core instalment has been available on consoles, and strategy fans are in for a bit of a treat - it's a wonderfully rich city builder, tasking players with establishing a thriving logistical network between the Old and New Worlds of the 19th century in order to facilitate their expansion.


Console players that opt for Anno 1800's Standard edition gain access to everything in the base game, which includes a sizeable story campaign, sandbox, plus PvP and co-op modes. The console version also promises a reworked UI designed specifically for controller input, plus all free improvements and quality of life features released on PC over the last four years.

Previously, Stadia controllers could only be used with the service, but - following requests from owners that the restriction be lifted in light of Stadia's closure - the company last week announced it would shortly be releasing a tool to do just that.


That "self-serve" tool is now live and accessible through a Chrome web browser, but does come with a number of limitations and restrictions.

"Today more than ever, I need your full energy and commitment to ensure we get back on the path to success," Guillemot wrote in an email to staff last week. "I am also asking that each of you be especially careful and strategic with your spending and initiatives, to ensure we're being as efficient and lean as possible. The ball is in your court to deliver this line-up on time and at the expected level of quality, and show everyone what we are capable of achieving."


In response to those comments, the Ubisoft Paris chapter of workers union Solidaires Informatique has now called for strike action on Friday, 27th January, writing, "The ball is in our court (but the money stays in his pocket)".

Over the weekend, Google unveiled a final surprise: Worm Game, a colourful version of Snake used within the company for testing purposes. Now, Stadia's remaining fans are fighting for the top spot on Worm Games' leaderboard before everything gets switched off forever (thanks, The Gamer).


Its unclear how many players are still actively using their Stadia console, but screenshots show at least a hundred have dipped in to try Google's farewell release, which also includes a credits screen for the service.

In virtue of being a dark web site&#8212;­that is, one hosted on the Tor anonymity network&#8212;­it should have been difficult for the site owner’s or a third party to determine the real IP address of any of the site’s visitors.</p>
<p>Yet, that’s exactly what the FBI did. It found Al-Azhari allegedly visited the site from an IP address associated with Al-Azhari’s grandmother’s house in Riverside, California. The FBI also found what specific pages Al-Azhari visited, including a section on donating Bitcoin; another focused on military operations conducted by ISIS fighters in Iraq, Syria, and Nigeria; and another page that provided links to material from ISIS’s media arm. Without the FBI deploying some form of surveillance technique, or Al-Azhari using another method to visit the site which exposed their IP address, this should not have been possible...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

A leaked image apparently showing the game's main menu appeared online last night, spread via Twitter and reddit, and has now been verified as real and recent by VGC, apparently taken from a PlayStation test build. 


The screenshot includes a menu with a "battle pass" section, above a squad loadout showing four characters, all of whom have levelling options.

Now, Activision Blizzard subsidiary Blizzard China has claimed it offered a six month extension to NetEase, while it spent time looking for a new long-term partner. 


Blizzard China revealed the claim today on social media site Weibo, news agency Reuters has reported. There's no detail on Activision Blizzard's ongoing search for a new Chinese partner, or word on how or when its games might return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long old wait, but HBO's live-action TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us is finally here - and, following this weekend's barnstorming premiere episode, HBO has teased some of the horrors to come in its latest trailer.


Prior to The Last of Us' TV premiere, early word from critics was extremely positive, giving fans of the games plenty to get excited about - and the first episode suggested the hype was well-earned, introducing a stellar cast and expanding on the source material's opening hour or so in largely effective, impactful ways.


With the groundwork now laid, Ellie and Joel's unforgettable road trip across a post-apocalyptic United States can begin in earnest - which, given the opening episode's surprisingly close adherence to the source material, will almost certainly see plenty of fan-favourite moments getting the live-action treatment as the weeks go on. And HBO has now offered a small tease of the events still to come in its latest trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, an unannounced new title from Riot Games' Riot Forge label, has been leaked by the South Korean ratings board.


As spotted by Gematsu, the now-pulled Game Rating and Administration Committee listing described Mageseeker as an "action game for PC" that casts players in the role of League of Legends champion Sylas, who joined the hugely popular MOBA's line-up in 2019.


Here's how Riot describes Sylas in his official biography: "Raised in one of Demacia's lesser quarters, Sylas of Dregbourne has come to symbolise the darker side of the Great City. As a boy, his ability to root out hidden sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers, who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers against them. Having now broken free, Sylas lives as a hardened revolutionary, using the magic of those around him to destroy the kingdom he once served...and his band of outcast mage followers seems to grow by the day."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retro spruce-up The House of the Dead: Remake is heading to PlayStation 5 this Friday, 20th January, promising "adjusted" graphics and performance.


Developed by Forever Entertainment and MegaPixel Studio, which previously collaborated on the similar Panzer Dragoon remake, House of the Dead: Remake is an updated version of Sega's beloved 1997 arcade rail-shooter, giving the original's zombie blasting action a fresh lick of modern-day paint.


Most obvious are the graphical enhancements, but House of the Dead: Remake also features new audio, updated controls (light guns are regrettably not standard on modern consoles), a new Horde mode that increases the on-screen enemy count, a photo mode, gallery, leaderboards, and achievements. There's also support for local two-player co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Valheim's long-awaited Mistlands biome finally here, developer Iron Gate Studio has opened up a little about what's next, sharing initial plans for the acclaimed early access viking survival game next biome, the Ashlands, in its latest blog update.


Taking the same unapologetically literal approach to naming that saw Valheim's new mist-shrouded biome become the Mistlands, the Ashlands will whisk players away to a land of ash, where the dead roam a landscape marked by volcanic activity.


While Valheim's Ashlands technically already exist in-game - albeit in temporary and extremely rudimentary form - their full development will usher in a radical overhaul, introducing a biome that Iron Gate says will be "quite different" from existing ones, serving up a "large chunk of land at the far south of the map, rather than small islands spread out over the world."

He became protective of me, constantly under my feet or curling up across my lap as soon as I sat down. He would not leave my side, and I did not understand why.


Soon enough, it all became clear. I was having a baby. Needless to say, I was surprised. But my dog was not. He knew. He had always known. Animals have a sense for these things. Which is why, when a dog started to become uneasy around a seemingly harmless lady in HBO's The Last of Us, I knew straight away something was amiss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Max Verstappen has called this year's 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual 'a clown show' after the high-profile sim racing event once again suffered server issues that saw two red flags that stopped racing and numerous disconnects that took teams out of contention - including reigning F1 world champion Verstappen's Team Redline, whose retirement inspired a polemic aimed towards the organisers Motorsport Games and the rFactor 2 platform on which the event was hosted. 


This weekend saw the third running of what's widely regarded as the biggest event in sim racing, with the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual attracting stars such as Verstappen and other real-world racers like Romain Grosjean and Felipe Drugovich. It's an impeccably presented thing with a team led by experienced motorsport commentators like Martin Haven and Ben Constanduros. 


Unfortunately this year's edition was once again plagued by connection issues with the rFactor 2 platform that's owned by Motorsport Games unable to host a 24 hour event with stability, with server issues forcing two red flags in the first seven hours of the event. The server issues were later revealed to be caused by participants inadvertently sharing IP addresses with the public.

The news follows the breakdown of Activision Blizzard and NetEase's publishing deal which allowed for World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch, Diablo 3 and more to be playable in the country.


A report by the South China Morning Post states the team had begun to shed people back in November, when it became clear the companies would not reach an agreement to extend their 14-year partnership. Now, most remaining employees have now been laid off or reassigned.

Three unannounced Ubisoft games were canned last week, on top of the four ditched last July. These latest cancellations follow a round of poor financial results and concern over the company's future portfolio - something which has also battered Ubisoft's stock price. 


Ubisoft's statement on the matter admitted it would continue on with "increased cautiousness over the coming years" as the games industry shifts towards "mega-brands and long-lasting titles" - something which raised questions as to where Beyond Good & Evil 2 fitted in.

It's thought we'll find out more on 28th January at the upcoming Royal Rumble in San Antonio, with hands-on gameplay and a new mode reveal said to be on the cards.

Insider Gaming says the information set to be shared that night will be embargoed until the end of the month "to allow for travel and content development", so expect more then. Further information not available at the San Antonio event is rumoured to be coming on 1st February, too.

Interestingly enough, it seems as though the soundtracks have been available to stream since September last year, but it's only now fans have noticed the cult game's OST sitting between other fan-favourite soundtracks, including Go Simpsonic with the Simpsons, Songs in the Key of Springfield, and Testify. 

No-one's entirely sure why Disney has made the soundtracks available without a formal announcement, but hey, we're not complaining.

The issue came to light when thousands of players flocked to Steam to lodge negative user reviews, dropping the "mostly positive" aggregate rating to "mostly negative". Many state that the message they received said "Ban (inactivity)" with no other reason given for their removal from the game.

In a brief blog post shared over the weekend, the developer said that an error had "triggered these false bans" and vows it will "make this right with affected players".

Whilst we already knew it was selling by the bucketload, NPD has now released December's top selling chart, confirming that Modern Warfare 2 managed to hold on to pole position and finishes the year as the US' best-selling game.

God of War: Ragnarok released in time to secure a position on 2022's Top Ten best-selling games, clocking in at number four behind Madden NFL 23, which took third place. The silver goes to Elden Ring, which held the top spot all year until Modern Warfare 2 came along and kicked it off its perch.

That's according to a translated article from Korean site MK Odyssey, which says the action horror - which cost 200 billion won (£132m / $161.5m) to make over three years - has affected parent company Krafton's value "due to sales shortages".        

According to Samsung Securities, Krafton expected to shift five million copies of The Callisto Protocol, but with just two million copies sold thus far, the stockbroker now thinks it "will not be easy" to hit that milestone.

A new behind-the-scenes video focuses on the motion-capture process, and we're also given a peek at the new single Tragic from Remains, a companion album to the game's official soundtrack.                                                                                                                                                                                        

"Shot on location at The House of Moves in Los Angeles, the video diary gives horror fans a fascinating window into the method of mo-cap, illustrating some of the key choreography and physical performance that goes into animating character movements," Gun explains.

<blockquote><p>Author and public-interest security technologist Schneier (<em>Data and Goliath</em>, 2015) defines a “hack” as an activity allowed by a system “that subverts the rules or norms of the system [&#8230;] at the expense of someone else affected by the system.” In accessing the security of a particular system, technologists such as Schneier look at how it might fail. In order to counter a hack, it becomes necessary to think like a hacker. Schneier lays out the ramifications of a variety of hacks, contrasting the hacking of the tax code to benefit the wealthy with hacks in realms such as sports that can innovate and change a game for the better. The key to dealing with hacks is being proactive and providing adequate patches to fix any vulnerabilities. Schneier’s fascinating work illustrates how susceptible many systems are to being hacked and how lives can be altered by these subversions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surprise, Stadia players! Google has released Worm Game, a game that "came to Stadia before Stadia came to the world".

The multiplayer arcade title became available overnight, just days before Google's innovative cloud gaming service terminates for good on 18th January, 2023. 

In a bittersweet twist, this means that Worm Game is both the last game to release on the service and the first, as it was used to test features from before Stadia's 2019 launch right up until last year.

As spotted by PC Gamer, a poster by the name of Leakerwanderer has uploaded asset repositories of Valve games as they were in 2016, including Portal, CS: Source, Team Fortress 2, Day of Defeat: Source, and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1, 2, and Half-Life 2 multiplayer. 

Despite being "threatened every time" - although by whom and why, we don't know - Leakerwanderer took to Discord to say that they now "don't care anymore" and uploaded the huge files, which include 61GB of Team Fortress 2 assets alone, including cut and modified content collated over many, many years.

The update ushers in changes to Vikendi, Sanhok, and Taego, as well as an "update to the 1v1 Arena in Training Mode". You can check out the highlights in the helpful video embedded below:

Vikendi's changes include multidrops - which means multiple care packages holding high-tier loot will randomly drop throughout the match - as well as Repair Kits which do exactly what they say on the tin and enable players to repair helmets and armour, plus vehicles, too, if you final the Mechanic's Toolbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following this week's announcement of yet another delay for Skull and Bones, Ubisoft has shared 30 minutes of new footage from its beleaguered pirate adventure, focusing on what it calls the game's "narrative gameplay".

Ubisoft has been gradually releasing many of its games on Steam, including Assassin's Creed Valhalla back in November. However, players were disappointed at that game's lack of Steam Achievements.




The Division 2 arrived on Steam on 12th January, but similarly does not include Steam Achievements resulting in a backlash from fans.

This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07321.pdf">paper</a> is a good survey of the field: what the threats are, how we might detect machine-generated text, directions for future research. It&#8217;s a solid grounding amongst all of the hype.</p>
<blockquote><p>Machine Generated Text: A Comprehensive Survey of Threat Models and Detection Methods</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Advances in natural language generation (NLG) have resulted in machine generated text that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human authored text. Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and  accountability...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The Halloween helmer has previously spoken of his interest in making a Dead Space film - and has now said that a project to get the survival horror franchise on the big screen is now in progress, albeit not with him attached.


"I'm a big video game fan, so I played all the games," Carpenter told Variety. "I was down looking at the new digital cameras, the RED, and happened to mention to them that I would love to do a Dead Space film. That just went around, and everybody said, 'Oh, when are you gonna do it?'"

Last night, upset at expected changes in the updated OGL resulted in a widely-shared push by D&D fans and streamers to ditch the game's online subscription, D&D Beyond. 


Gizmodo, which initially published details of the updated OGL last week, subsequently reported that this latest backlash has prompted Wizards of the Coast to cancel its plans to formally announce the changes for the time being, leaving the company's upper management in a "scramble to adjust their messaging around the situation".

Sources told the website both Google and Nvidia had "expressed concerns" to the Federal Trade Commision (FTC), which sued to block the deal in December.


The FTC has argued the buyout, which would grant Microsoft ownership of the likes of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, would reduce competition in the industry - a claim Microsoft has strongly denied. A trial is set for August.

Skull and Bones, which has been in development since 2013, was revealed in 2017 but has faced repeated delays since then, its release most recently being moved from November 2022 to March 2023. Yesterday though, Ubisoft confirmed it was pushing the troubled game's launch back yet again, this time to "early" in the fiscal year 2023-24.


In a follow-up statement shared by the official Skull and Bones Twitter account, Ubisoft spoke a little more about the delay, saying its "determination and focus remain the same - offer the best in-game experience possible to our play from day 1".

That's according to NBC News, which obtained a copy of the criminal complaint filed against Roiland through the Orange County Superior Court, charging him with "one felony count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud and/or deceit".


The complaint relates to an incident which took place on or around 19th January 2020, involving "an anonymous Jane Doe who was dating Roiland at the time." Roiland is said to have been charged in May 2020 then arrested and released on a $50,000 USD bond in August of the same year. He was then arraigned in October 2020 and pleaded not guilty to both charges.

Launched in 2016, GOG Connect was a neat proposition on paper, allowing users to link their GOG and Steam accounts and then get a duplicate, DRM-free version of a game they'd already purchased on Valve's platform over on GOG.


In practice, though, it was all a bit restrictive, with GOG only offering a very limited selection of eligible games - and even those could only be added to a user's GOG library within a very strict timeframe for contractual reasons. Perhaps unsurprisingly, support for the service slowly dwindled and GOG Connect has now been inactive (if not officially dead) for years.

Wadjet Eye, if you're unfamiliar, has been releasing highly acclaimed, old-school-inspired point-and-click adventures - complete with some gorgeous pixel art - since 2006. The studio's earliest titles - namely Shivah, which explores themes around the Jewish faith, and the entire Blackwell supernatural detective series - are all present and correct in Humble's latest bundle.


And it continues, serving up some real gems as the bundle shifts through sci-fi - in Resonance, TechnoBabylon, and Gemini Rue - to post-apocalyptic nightmare in Shardlight and Promordia to something altogether weirder with Wormwood Studios' acclaimed Strangeland, in which a man must unravel his past while exploring a terrifyingly surreal carnival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello and welcome back to the Eurogamer Newscast! We're already almost halfway through January 2023 and the video games industry is stirring. There are huge games on the horizon and plenty to look forward to - and look forward we will. 

2023 promises to be a stellar year for video games, full of proper current-gen console exclusives, awesome indies and more than a few titles held up from last year (and the year before). The next 12 months should see all of these and more splurge out onto the scene for you to try. But where to start? 
Joining me to pick out our highlights for the year are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan - and there's some surprising picks in there, as well as Pikmin 4! Apparently some new Final Fantasy game is coming out too, and Zelda's up to something. Beyond video games themselves, there's also The Last of Us TV show to look forward to - that's out next week! - and hopefully some recommendations from us for some lesser-known gems also waiting in the wings. Thanks for watching!

Now, I know what you are thinking: "Victoria, why would you care about this? You would have been a newborn when this cartoon was playing on TV and therefore have no idea what was happening. You were probably just learning what your hand was or experiencing mashed potatoes for the first time."


This is very true. I was. But I'm also a huge Legend of Zelda fan, and that means as soon as I was aware of the existence of the Zelda cartoon, I tracked it down and watched it for myself. And then, when I had children of my own, I watched it again with them on YouTube. It was a family affair and, as it turns out, having this series become a bit of an ongoing family affair was also a theme during the cartoon's conception. How's that for a segue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 developer Bungie has announced a major change for the game's selection of armour mods, which - as you might expect - allow you to modify your character's abilities.


Beginning now, all "standard" armour mods have been unlocked for all players - a move Bungie says is designed to allow "everyone a chance to enjoy all mods in their current state" ahead of the upcoming Lightfall expansion, which will feature "big changes" to buildcrafting. 


It's an interesting move which will allow players far more freedom to experiment with armour mods to find the setup that best suits their playstyle - without relying on the random chances of particular mods turning up for sale via Ada-1's in-game shop.

Kubernetes has been widely adopted, and many organizations use it as their de-facto orchestration engine for running workloads that need to be created and deleted frequently.
Therefore, proper scheduling of the pods is key to ensuring that application pods are up and running within the Kubernetes cluster without any issues. This article delves into the use cases around resource management by leveraging the PriorityClass object to protect mission-critical or high-priority pods from getting evicted and making sure that the application pods are up, running, and serving traffic.

Piranha Games president Russ Bullock shared the news during an interview with the NoGutsNoGalaxy podcast (thanks PC Gamer), teasing, "I'll just say that it's not MechWarrior Online 2, it's not the successor to MechWarrior Online, it's not an online PvP [game] - think of it more in line with MechWarrior 5, but a standalone game, a standalone product."


According to Bullock, the currently mysterious title - which is being developed for PC and consoles - follows "more of a single-player co-op type of pathway". Beyond that, though, details are thin, and a full reveal may not happen until this autumn.

Announcing the news, Ubisoft said it was facing "major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles", compounded by the underperformance of recent launches including Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023.


Ubisoft says the resulting financial pressures have triggered a full review of its revenue prospects, leading to an "increased cautiousness over the coming years". As a result it has decided to cancel three unannounced projects, on top of the four games cancelled last July.

Back 4 Blood is, of course, the co-op zombie shooter from Left 4 Dead studio Turtle Rock, which aims to give the genre of a bit of a twist through game-altering deck building. Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition, meanwhile, is Capcom's well-regarded most recent chapter in the long-running demonic hack-and-slash series. 


Acclaimed supernatural narrative adventure series Life is Strange is actually joining the PlayStation Plus catalogue with two instalments - developer Dontnod's initial episodic adventure and Deck Nine's prequel Before the Storm, which follows the adventures of Chloe Price before she met the first game's protagonist Max Caulfield.

The feature will be available for Xbox Insiders using the energy saving shutdown power option and with their console configured to support automatic updates.


From today, Insiders will also have their Xbox Series X/S console automatically update to the shutdown option, which reduces power consumption while the console is switched off.

However, if you are anything like me and a big fan of The Last of Us, this show may well make the eye bags and inevitable reliance on intravenous coffee to get you through the rest of the next day worthwhile.

Scourge and Plague (1500 V-Bucks each) returned to Fortnite's infamous rotating item shop at midnight last night, after an absence of 1080 days. Both are styled after the beaked physicians seen in the 16th and 17th centuries who treated bubonic plague victims.


Originally released in late 2018, the skins formed a regular and popular set which went on sale every couple of months - until their last appearance at the end of January 2020. At the time, I remember their spotlight in the item shop raising eyebrows, as the early stages of the Covid pandemic were already dominating global news.

These changes, which were first laid out by YouTube in November, state the platform's "approach to profanity is changing" (thanks, Kotaku).


Now, all profanities are "treated equally" across the site, meaning words like 'crap' carry the same weight as 'fuck' as far as inappropriate language use goes (the site has, however, eased its stance on both "hell" and "damn" - these words are no longer classed as profanities and can be used more freely).

The phenomenon of using machine learning to teach an AI program how to play Rocket League is nothing new, as this PC Gamer report delves into. Trained bots have been pitted against each other for a while in local matches, and the question of how much and how well an AI program can learn to play a game like Rocket League is an interesting one to answer.


The problem comes with the seemingly more recent discovery by players that versions of the game's AI-trained Nexto bot are now being used to cheat in Rocket League's competitive ranked play modes, disguised as human players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has responded to the question of a possible PC release.


On a Final Fantasy 14 Mahjong stream with the rest of the development team, Yoshida was asked about rumours of a Final Fantasy 16 PC release.


"I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that. In either case, please buy the PS5 [version]!" he said, as per a translation from streamer and translator Aitai Kimochi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're less than a week away from the highly anticipated debut of HBO's live-action The Last of Us TV adaptation and early reviews from critics are positively glowing, with the series currently enjoying a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes across more than 40 reviews at the time of writing.


First announced back in 2020, HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation has been written and created by Chernobyl's Craig Mazin, alongside Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann. It stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, with other notable cast members including Nick Offerman in the role of Bill, Jeffrey Pierce (who played Joel's brother Tommy in the Last of Us video games) as quarantine zone rebel Perry, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge, who reprises her video game role of Marlene, the leader of the Fireflies resistance.


The last few months have seen HBO's PR machine crank into top gear as The Last of Us' January release approaches, with December bringing the show's second full-length trailer. Now, though, some lucky professional critics have had the chance to watch the entirety of the show's first season, and - despite some notable changes to the source material - the praise is effusive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK government has passed a law mandating new homes in England must be built with "lightning-fast" gigabit-capable broadband connections.


Gigabit broadband - that is, broadband capable of download speeds of at least 1 gigabit-per-second - is currently available in over 72% of the UK, according to the government's figures. However, a new law, in effect since December, aims to increases that percentage further by making it a legal requirement that new homes are fitted with infrastructure and connections capable of delivering gigabit broadband.


"The updated regulations mean that more people moving into new homes will have a gigabit-capable broadband connection ready when construction is completed," the government explained, "avoiding the need for costly and disruptive installation work after the home is built and enabling residents to arrange the best possible internet service at the point they move in."

One Piece Odyssey unfolds on a mysterious island discovered by the Straw Hats pirate gang after their ship is caught in a storm. The ensuing action takes the form of an RPG, with open-world exploration punctuated by turn-based battles and dungeons - with each of the game's playable characters able to use their unique abilities in variety of situations, including battles, traversal, and puzzle solving.


Playable characters include Luffy, Zoro, Sani, Usopp, and Nami, with the likes of Portgas D. Ace and Trafalgar Law putting in an appearance as supporting characters that can fight alongside the core crew. In story terms, that's possible thanks to Memoria - a realm made of the Straw Hats' memories, which they'll need to explore to retrieve their lost abilities.

The UK trade organisation has estimated games made £4.66bn last year (a rise of 2.3 percent from 2021). This means that, once again, games are the biggest home entertainment industry in the UK (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). 


Most of this preliminary figure is made up by digital game sales, which according to ERA are estimated to represent around £4.17bn in revenue. This is a rise of 3.1 percent year-on-year.

The Shockwave Hammer, introduced last month alongside the game's bumper Chapter 4 revamp, was  disabled yesterday in several of Fortnite's competitive modes as a glitch which allowed players to repeatedly spam the item became rampant. 


Players have taken to social media over the past week to brand the game as "unplayable" after the glitch's use spread - allowing players to jump around the map non-stop, without the item's usual cooldown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planet Coaster developer Frontier has seen its share price drop by 40 percent after the studio admitted its recent release F1 Manager 2022 had failed to meet sales expectations.


F1 Manager 2022 was an important launch for Frontier, announced as the first game in a new and lucrative annual franchise for the studio, following the studio's previous sales disappointment Jurassic World Evolution 2. 


But while initial "player engagement at release in August 2022" was "broadly in-line with original expectations", interest in the game soon dropped off and could not be revived despite "key holiday season price promotions", Frontier admitted in a financial update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitmap Books, the UK publisher known for its sumptuously designed line-up of retro gaming books, has announced it's cancelling its planned unofficial Mega Drive/Genesis Visual Compendium following threats of legal action from Sega.


Bitmap's Mega Drive Visual Compendium would have been the eighth title in the striking Visual Compendium series, following books covering the gaming highlights and history of the Atari 2600/7800, Commodore 64, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, NES, SNES, and Master System.


The latter volume was produced in partnership with Sega, but despite Bitmap Books' efforts, its planned Mega Drive Visual Compendium didn't have the official backing of the company, ultimately leading to its demise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse, the third and regrettably final season of Telltale Games' episodic point-and-click adventure series, will be getting the remaster treatment in 2023 courtesy of developer Skunkape Games.


The Devil's Playhouse, which initially released all the way back in 2010, features yet more anarchic escapades from cult comic book artist Steve Purcell's crime-fighting dog and bunny duo Sam & Max, this time pitting the pair against Eldritch gods, alien warlords, and more in a battle to control an ancient, otherworldly power.


Skunkape hasn't said much too much about The Devil's Playhouse Remastered beyond confirmation it'll launch later this year, but it seems reasonable to expect the same kind of attention seen in the developer's previous Sam & Max remasters - Save the World and Beyond Time and Space - which featured the likes of enhanced graphics and audio, dynamic lighting, improved lip syncing, a new user interface, controller support, and more.

That's according to Windows Central's Jez Corden, who claims the showcase - reportedly titled Xbox Developer_Direct - will air on Wednesday, 25th January at 12pm PT/8pm in the UK.


Citing a "variety of sources familiar with Microsoft's plans", Corden says the showcase will focus on content from Xbox and Bethesda, offering an "intimate" look at "major" first-party titles for 2023. These will reportedly include Arkane's delayed Redfall, Turn 10 Studios' latest Forza Motorsport, Mojang's action-strategy spin-off Minecraft Legends, and unspecified "content" from content from ZeniMax Online Studios.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're mere weeks away from the release of EA Motive's extremely promising remake of sci-fi horror classic Dead Space, and to sweeten the deal for those considering a pre-order, EA is bundling in a copy of the original Dead Space 2 on Steam.


EA Motive's Dead Space remake - which launches for PC and current-gen consoles on 27th January - is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games' much-loved 2008 original, reimagining engineer Isaac Clarke's terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura with enhanced audio and visuals, gameplay refinements, and more.


As spotted by VG247, players that pre-order the remake on Steam will now get a nifty bonus in the form of 2011's Dead Space 2, meaning they can dive straight into the Isaac's continuing story when the credits roll. Despite its age, Dead Space 2 ordinarily costs £17.99 on Steam, so that's a decent saving for anyone who's yet to experience the well-regarded sequel.

However, over the weekend a fairly big change came to light - in HBO's take on the series, the Cordyceps infection will not be spread by spores in the air. Rather, it will be able to spread by "tendrils" that can become a "network that is interconnected".


During an interview with Collider, co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin spoke more about pandemics generally, and how the infection would be depicted in the show.

The games keeping us busy this weekend? As is usually the case, the top two are CS:GO and Dota 2, but Among Us clone Goose Goose Duck jumps in to take the bronze. PUBG, Apex Legends, Lost Ark, GTA 5, Rust, Modern Warfare 2, and Wallpaper Engine round out the top ten respectively.

We're big fans of FuturLab's Powerwash Simulator here at Eurogamer, and have written about it extensively. You clean dirt off stuff, essentially. It's satisfying, therapeutic and weirdly tricky at times. You can even go prone like an MLG powerwash pro to get right under those hard to reach bits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an inglorious end to his career at Manchester United and, perhaps, his national team Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo has left elite level football for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr and a contract reportedly worth up to €200m (£177m) a year. And with the move comes an inevitable - some would say long overdue - FIFA rating downgrade.


37-year-old Ronaldo, who for years had been one of the two best cards in the FIFA games alongside World Cup winner Lionel Messi, had already dropped three positions for the FIFA 23 top 10 with a 90-rated card. Now, after Ronaldo's poor performance at the World Cup and his move to the Saudi Pro League, EA has knocked Ronaldo down a further peg to his lowest rating since 2007, when the forward broke through at Manchester United.


Ronaldo's overall rating is now 88, two lower than the 90 he started FIFA 23 with back in September. Crucially, his specific stats are also lower. His dribbling, for example, is down to 81 from 84, his stamina down to 70 from 74.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dwarf Fortress' December Steam launch was a big hit - it sold almost half a million copies in less than a month.


Bay 12 Games' famously impenetrable simulation game launched on Steam on 6th December in spruced up form, with actual graphics as opposed to the text or "ASCII" graphics of the original version.


In a forum post, programmer and co-designer Tarn Adams declared Dwarf Fortress' Steam launch, which came after 16 years of free availability, a "wild success". Dwarf Fortress is also sitting on an "overwhelmingly positive" user review rating on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lawsuit between Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red and its investors has been settled for $1.85m.


The game was released in a notoriously buggy state, particularly on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which led to a complaint filed in December 2020 that alleged the developer misled both customers and investors on how playable the game was.



Now, a federal judge in California has signed off on the settlement (thanks ArsTechnica), where everybody who acquired publicly traded CDPR shares throughout most of 2020 is eligible for settlement funds at roughly $0.49 per eligible share.

In December, Microsoft claimed the FTC's lawsuit against its Activision Blizzard buyout was unconstitutional, and specifically violated the Fifth Amendment.


However, the company has now gone back on this argument, admitting it "should have dropped these defences before we filed".

Ensuring the disruptions to your applications do not affect its availability isn't a simple
task. Last month's release of Kubernetes v1.26 lets you specify an unhealthy pod eviction policy
for PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs)
to help you maintain that availability during node management operations.
In this article, we will dive deeper into what modifications were introduced for PDBs to
give application owners greater flexibility in managing disruptions.
What problems does this solve?
API-initiated eviction of pods respects PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs). This means that a requested voluntary disruption

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2 will be "faithful to the original title" while also modernising areas that haven't aged as well. 


That's according to Bloober Team's marketing chief Anna Jasińska in an interview with DreadXP.


Asked about the extent the studio was given free reign by Konami to transform the game with its own vision, Jasińska said: "We are focusing on bringing the distinct, visceral atmosphere back in the modernised Silent Hill 2. Longtime fans shouldn’t worry about us 'missing the point' while we’re livening up the title. We faithfully stick to the traditional story canon while remaking the gameplay and updating the graphics from the ground up."

Mortal Shell is a Dark-Souls inspired action RPG from Cold Symmetry, with the developer stating it will "test your sanity and resilience".

Shared as part of CES 2023, this trailer shows off the game with Nvidia's latest ray tracing tech in play. It's a bite-sized little teaser that begins with a few sweeping shots showing the destruction and destitution left in The Day Before's version of a post-pandemic America. 


It then cuts to scenes of the player character shooting down their enemies, engaging in stealthy trips into darkened rooms and along questionable corridors, and, of course, a swarming zombie horde. You can see it for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti graphics card goes on sale today, offering largely RTX 3090 to 3090 Ti level performance at $799 in the US and £799 in the UK. That's the narrative, anyway - but how many cards will actually be available at the MSRP/RRP? 
It's an important question, because as the old saying goes, there are no bad products, just bad prices. The RTX 4070 Ti is quite a strong option at $799, given its level of performance - particularly for those upgrading from Pascal (GTX 10-series) and Turing (20-series) GPUs or AMD's equivalents. At $899 or $999 though, this graphics card starts to make much less sense. 
And with no Founders Edition cards available, we're relying on third-party GPU makers to create SKUs that meet that price point - when it would be much more profitable for them to offer overclocked designs with oversized coolers and RGB bling for $50, $100 or $200 more. In fact, it's these sorts of cards that seem to have been sent out for review, including our unit which offered a paltry 30MHz overclock over stock - but came with a higher price tag to match.

The $7.7m lawsuit was filed last year due to a number of false copyright takedowns sent to Destiny 2 players in March. In June the perpetrator was identified as Nicholas Minor a.k.a Lord Nazo.




At the time, Bungie alleged that Minor launched a "malicious campaign to serve fraudulent takedown notices to some of the most prominent and passionate members of that fanbase, purportedly on Bungie's behalf, in apparent retaliation for Bungie enforcing its copyrights against material Minor uploaded to his own YouTube channel".

Smaller clubs like Wrexham aren't normally featured in FIFA, but the club entered the game in FIFA 22 in the "Rest of the World" category, likely due to the novelty of Reynolds and McElhenney being the new owners. 


Wrexham then returned for FIFA 23, only this time, players have found some trash talk from Reynolds and McElhenney from the benches.

This latest update video is truly a sight to behold. Along with the Post Boxers, it also introduces us to another bot out for our blood - the Naval Walker. This is a sentient (in so much as it walks around at its own free will) mine that will chase you down. There are different types of these walkers throughout the mod, with the paint on each denoting which kind you are dealing with.

        <updated>2023-01-05T12:18:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD has announced a raft of new Ryzen processors at its CES 2023 showcase, including the long-awaited Ryzen 7000X3D processors that should provide a stern rejoinder to Intel's 13th-gen desktop CPUs and could let Team Red reclaim the gaming performance crown. 
The idea here is pretty simple: take the '3D V-Cache' technology that made AMD's last-gen Ryzen 7 5800X3D so fast that it challenged even next-gen flagship CPUs, and pair it with some of AMD's fastest Ryzen 7000 processors. The result is three new chips, the Ryzen 7800X3D, Ryzen 7900X3D and the Ryzen 7950X3D. All three come with dramatically increased cache sizes - 104MB of L2 and L3 cache on the Ryzen 7 and up to 144MB on the Ryzen 9 - which minimise the time CPUs spend waiting for data to be copied into the cache, increasing performance considerably in some games. 
In AMD-provided benchmarks, the 7800X3D was between 10 and 25 percent faster than the 5800X3D at 1080p in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Borderlands 3 and F1 22 - slightly less than I would have expected, given that the 7800X3D is also using DDR5 RAM versus the DDR4 on the 5800X3D. Perhaps a more interesting comparison is that of the 7950X3D against the 13900K, where AMD showed between a nine and 24 percent performance lead in Watchdogs Legion, Dota 2, Rainbow Six Siege and Horizon Zero Dawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you who, like me, are quite partial to a live action video game adaptation, I am pleased to tell you we have been given a new look at Sony's upcoming Gran Turismo film.


This trailer covers a few behind the scenes shots that give us a closer look at how the film was made - things like cars rigged up with cameras left, right and centre. It also has some quotes from the film's actors, including Pirates of the Caribbean and Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom who has promised us all "body vibrating sound" that will mean viewers will feel "every jolt [and] every thrill" of the race on the film's release (which will be exclusively in theatres). 


Not that this film is going to solely focus on the cars, however. The cast has said there will be "heart-pounding action, drama [and] a love story" also woven into the script, that follows the true story of Jann Mardenborough.

It's a big boon for the new hardware, joining Horizon Call of the Mountain when it comes to first-party titles available for PSVR2 at launch. Racing games are a natural fit for virtual reality - it's been my preferred way to play ever since it became a viable option - and Gran Turismo 7 follows in the footsteps of Gran Turismo Sport which was supported by the original PSVR headset.


PlayStation VR2 is coming out on February 22nd, with units costing a cool £530. Here's everything you need to know about PSVR2, including its launch titles and full specs - and it's a device that Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton has been very enthusiastic about since trying it for himself.

The v1.25 release of Kubernetes introduced an alpha feature to change how a default StorageClass was assigned to a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
With the feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and PVC second to assign the class. Additionally, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned can be updated later.
This feature was graduated to beta in Kubernetes 1.26.
You can read retroactive default StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation for more details about how to use that,
or you can read on to learn about why the Kubernetes project is making this change.
Why did StorageClass assignment need improvements
Users might already be familiar with a similar feature that assigns default StorageClasses to new PVCs at the …]]></summary>

Along with Pedro Pascal's Joel, we will see all the highs and lows these two characters go through on their perilous journey across America when the show makes its debut later this month. 


However, it turns out that before Ramsey landed the part of Ellie, fellow Game of Thrones alum Maisie Williams (who played Arya Stark) was in talks for the role back when the game was being pegged for a film adaptation.


Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann said the team needed to ensure that whoever was cast as Ellie in any adaptation would be able to appear "tough and vulnerable and wise beyond [their] years and also have a potential for violence" all at once.

This new image shows an abandoned cruise liner that, along with the rest of the world, has succumbed to the weather and decay of time. Its windows have been smashed, its hull has rusted - a far cry from its presumably once luxurious state. 


Along with this artwork, which you can see in full below, Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann stated the studio's upcoming multiplayer project is "shaping up to be a fresh, new experience". But while it may be fresh and new, Druckmann has said it will still be an experience "rooted in Naughty Dog's passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay".

As unearthed from Japanese magazines by YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming, the game's writers inserted their experience of crunch into the mouths of the game's NPCs.

However, we are now just shy of five years since that initial trailer first splashed its surreal way onto our screens, and with the release now a little over a month away (21st February), the developer has addressed the game's lengthy development.


According to Atomic Heart director Robert Bagratuni, the game's delay and our subsequent long wait for this release can be attributed to four things - "youth, ambition, innovation and new technology".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring has won yet more awards, with Steam users voting it the Best Game You Suck At.


It's just one of many accolades for the notoriously tricky title, but an amusingly tongue in cheek one for "the toughest game we've ever loved".


The game was also awarded Game of the Year, beating out Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Stray, God of War, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

That's coming from FTC lawyer James Weingarten, who took part in a pretrial hearing on Tuesday to discuss Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a record-breaking $69bn.


Back in December, the FTC revealed its intention to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, claiming should the deal be allowed to proceed, it would enable the company to suppress its fellow games industry competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia just wrapped up its CES press conference, unveiling a new desktop graphics card - the RTX 4070 Ti - plus a lineup of RTX 40-series GPUs for laptops and a new RTX 4080 tier for its GeForce Now streaming service. Here's what you need to know.
First, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti. This is the renamed, repriced and now relaunched version of the RTX 4080 12GB that was so roundly derided upon its announcement that Nvidia 'unlaunched' the card soon thereafter. The key to that move was a feeling of confusion from gamers and press alike that the card was too distant in price and performance from the 4080 16GB, as it wasn't even based on the same AD103 chip. 
Now, the GPU seems more sensibly positioned - as a small improvement over the popular last-gen RTX 3080, with a price to match of $799. With DLSS 3 frame generation, it can be up to three times faster than the RTX 3090 Ti while consuming nearly half the power, although we look forward to putting those claims to the test. The latest Ada Lovelace card is scheduled to launch on January 5th, so we don't have too long to wait!

Polish studio The Astronauts said the trailer, below, shows off Witchfire's "rapid gunplay and new open-level design (not to be confused with fully open-world gameplay)".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the imminent closedown of the 3DS eShop - which is coming at the end of March this year, with its Wii U sibling being taken down with it - it seems some thoroughbreds are bolting the stables and heading for pastures new, with Game Freak's Pocket Card Jockey coming to iOS later this month. 


Pocket Card Jockey first launched on 3DS back in 2013, and is one of Game Freak's more successful non-Pokémon  games. An intriguing mash-up of horse racing and solitaire, it's gone on to earn cult status (though I recall Eurogamer's former in-house solitaire expert Oli Welsh being charmed but not wowed by this take on the form). 


Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! - spotted by our friends at VGC - is a buffed-up re-release for Apple Arcade,  with new 3D visuals for racing sections, and it's due out 20th January. It's got me wondering what other 3DS gems are ripe for being rescued by new ports - is it too much to hope for a re-release of Attack of the Friday Monsters?

Stuart's involment with the project was first announced back in 2021. However, speaking to Collider earlier this month, the screenwriter revealed he is no longer a showrunner on the adaptation due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives. 


"I think it was a little bit of a move of executives from LA to London, and it allowed the London group who, unfortunately, had to inherit my vision of what it was instead of getting to develop their own vision," Stuart explained to the publication.

Sharing an update earlier today, Nightdive revealed the "scope and scale" of the project has "evolved dramatically" over the past few years. This, in part, is thanks to publisher Prime Matter joining the project.


With this publisher on board, Nightdive Studios has been able to "focus on quality-of-life improvements, bug fixing, and localisation support", things it calls "the last major steps towards releasing a game we're all incredibly proud of".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ken Block, star of Codemasters' Dirt series and a figure whose passion for motorsports helped push it to new audiences, has died at the age of 55 following a snowmobile accident on his ranch in Utah.

Block was an entrepreneur who co-founded DC Shoes in 1994, using his success to help pursue his automotive passions. In the 00s Block became a professional rally driver who went on to participate in the sport at its highest level in the WRC, though his results - with only a small handful of points and no podiums to show for his 24 appearances between 2007 and 2018 - don't reflect his true legacy as he popularised the sport through his hugely successful series of Gymkhana videos. 
WRC legend Sébastien Ogier led the many tributes to the great man. "Ken was a visionary, so passionate and inspiring," the eight-time WRC champion said on Twitter. "He knew like no other how to combine motorsport and a big show. He lived his life to the fullest and I'll never forget his smile and laugh."

Meanwhile, it is steadily ending support for a selection of its games, making the company's offerings a much leaner dish for consumers (and perhaps potential buyers?).


In his recent New Year's letter, Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda stated 2023 will be a year of "major evolution and transformation" for the company, with "multiple blockchain games based on original IPs under development" at this time. Some of these, Matsuda noted, have already been announced, while others will be unveiled at a later date.

Kubernetes v1.26, released last month, introduced an alpha feature that
lets you specify a data source for a PersistentVolumeClaim, even where the source
data belong to a different namespace.
With the new feature enabled, you specify a namespace in the dataSourceRef field of
a new PersistentVolumeClaim. Once Kubernetes checks that access is OK, the new
PersistentVolume can populate its data from the storage source specified in that other
namespace.
Before Kubernetes v1.26, provided your cluster had the AnyVolumeDataSource feature enabled,
you could already provision new volumes from a data source in the same
namespace.
However, that only worked for the data source in the same namespace,
therefore users couldn't provision a PersistentVolume with …]]></summary>

<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eavesdropping from the user&#8217;s smartphone is a well-known threat to the user&#8217;s safety and privacy. Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>
