        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a Santa descending from the heavens on a reindeer made of space, Hello Games has delved into its sack of procedural treats to give good No Man's Sky fans one final gift for 2022: another chance to play all four of this year's Expeditions and snag any goodies they might have missed the first time around.


Expeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are something like No Man's Sky's stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. And the rewards for completing each one are usually pretty neat, ranging from robot dog companions to your very own space whale.


And now Hello Games has confirmed it'll be re-running all four of 2022's Expedition starting this Thursday, 24th November. As was the case in last year's redux event, Expeditions will run in truncated form, each lasting for just two weeks before the next one rolls in - meaning players eager to acquire any rewards they might have missed (including those on Switch, who haven't had chance to play any of these yet) will have to work quick.

Arika's The Grand Master series first appeared in Japanese arcades back in 1988, where it quickly gained a reputation for its difficulty, thanks to the rapid drop speed increase during play. It also features a grading system, ranking performance all the way up to Grand Master.


Several sequels followed, and the series eventually made the jump to home consoles in Japan with 2005's Tetris: The Grand Master Ace for Xbox 360 - which was to be its final release.

First up in the Leader Pass' inaugural DLC, known as the Great Negotiations Pack, is Abraham Lincoln, representing the United States. Lincoln abides by the Preserver of the Union agenda - meaning he only likes civilisations with the same form of government - and makes use of his Emancipation Proclamation ability, which has a number of different effects depending on the expansions players have installed.


Those with just the base game get +2 Amenities for Industrial Zones and their buildings, but receive -1 Amenities for Plantations. These numbers increase to +3 Amenities per turn and -2 Loyalty respectively when using the Rise and Fall & Gathering Storm DLCs.

I briefly tested the two methods currently making the rounds in the community, and whilst one worked for me, the other didn't. So be wary, your mileage may vary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today decided to launch an in-depth investigation into Apple and Google, looking at the restrictions set by each company that affect access to smartphone cloud gaming.


The move follows an earlier proposal to investigate the two companies' market power, and a year-long study of the iPhone and Android ecosystems. That report, published in June, determined Apple and Google held "an effective duopoly" over smartphone markets, allowing them to "exercise a stranglehold" over mobile operating systems, app stores and web browsers.


Further work by the CMA included consultations with unnamed "cloud gaming service providers", as well as web developers and browser makers, who said Apple and Google's approach was "harming their businesses, holding back innovation, and adding unnecessary costs". These concerns will be investigated further as part of a far-reaching "Phase 2" CMA investigation.

Also, if you're anything like me, you'll have rewatched yesterday's Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC Wave 3 trailer multiple times, trying to spot all the tweaks and additions to some of the many returning tracks. (And yes, that does sound like a newly-recorded version of Maple Treeway's score.)


Alongside yesterday's trailer I saw a generally warmer reception to the visuals in these latest additions than in some of the other DLC drops so far - which have been criticised by fans as not standing up to graphical quality seen in the base game. These DLC tracks are, by and large, taken from Mario Kart Tour - the series' smartphone spin-off - with an extra layer of polish attached.

The intended sequence of the game would see you play through The First Day of School quest, which would then unlock all the other storylines in the game.
However, players have found a way to skip the latter section of the quest, allowing you to cut out the tedium of meeting your new classmates and teachers and get straight into exploring the open-world of Paldea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's World Cup is a little different, as I think we all understand. Amidst headlines on migrant worker conditions, LGBTQ+ rights and criticism of the tournament from both players and fans, it's been interesting to see how brands - and video games - are noting Qatar 2022.


Fortnite has a history with football - and its governing bodies. Some of its most popular skins are based on football kit designs, and the game's meme-like dances were a fixture of England's 2018 World Cup squad. Last year, Epic Games officially licensed the likenesses of England's Harry Kane and Germany's Marco Reus for the delayed 2020 Euros, and featured an in-game "UEFA Euro 2020 Cup" tournament with cash prizes. 


Prior to that, Fortnite has added skins wearing the officially-licensed football shirts of 23 top teams worldwide, including many from the Premiership. Fortnite also has an officially licensed Neymar Jr. skin, and an emote where you can punch the air that was launched in a collaboration with Pelé.

Activision shared the news of this milestone on its social media feeds, thanking those who have taken part in its frenzied battlegrounds so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to the days of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and you may recall an infamous bug that allowed players to soar through the skies in a fashion that should not be not humanly possible. This became known as the 'Superman' exploit, due to the way the players looked when this glitch was in motion - positioned horizontally in a skydiving position.


And now, when playing Call of Duty's most recent offerings of Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, you may well see this move in play once more. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's just your teammate channelling their inner Clark Kent. 


Today's version of the Superman exploit was recently shared by prolific Warzone 2 player Wuqi. In a compilation, the gamer can be seen bouncing off certain points on the maps while diving in the air, giving them a soaring boost. This, as you can see below, allows them to cover ground a lot more quickly than the more traditional methods of traversal.

It was around this time that the RPG's PS4 version disappeared from the PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue.

Crossplay and cross-progression have, of course, been available in Rainbow Six Siege for some time now, but only between PC, Stadia, and Luna. As of next month, though, that'll open out to incorporate PlayStation and Xbox, so console owners can take advantage of the features too.


From 6th December, console players can access their progress, currencies, and other items across all platforms simply by logging into their accounts. They can also team up with friends on other consoles via Ubisoft Connect, although it's possible to opt out of crossplay if preferred.

Marvin's imminent arrival was teased last week as Season 2 got underway, but he officially joins the line-up today, bringing Multiversus' total number of playable fighters up to 23 - with Marvin joining recent additions such as Black Adam and Gremlins' Gizmo and Stripe.


Marvin can be unlocked with 3000 Gold, 1 Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium, and features three signature moves. There's his B-23 Bubble Blaster, giving players the power to launch bubble projectiles, and that's joined by his K-62 Projectile Modulator - basically a big red button that will reverse the direction of allied projectiles. Finally, Marvin can plant his flag into the ground, simultaneously claiming it for Mars and sending enemies skyward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As intense government scrutiny of Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard continues, with many regulatory bodies placing particular importance on the future of the Call of Duty franchise, Microsoft has told the New York Times it offered Sony a 10-year deal to keep the series on PlayStation earlier this month.


In total, 16 regulatory bodies around the world have launched investigations into Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard to assess its likely impact on competition. So far, only Brazil and Saudi Arabia have approved the deal, with a number of territories, including the European Commission and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, having announced more in-depth reviews of the matter.


In both those cases, Call of Duty's future has been highlighted as a particular concern, with regulators raising fears the juggernaut franchise may be leveraged by Microsoft to gain an unfair advantage over its competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has delayed its promised fix for excessive autonomous meanness in The Sims 4, meaning players are now going to have to put up with their Sims spontaneously picking fights and ruining each others lives until early December.


All this started back in October when, following a patch update, The Sims 4 players began reporting their Sims were autonomously insulting friends, relatives, and passersby at an alarming frequency, causing havoc to their carefully curated stories.


Eventually, with insults continuing to fly and households lying in ruin, EA moved to acknowledge the issue, promising a fix would arrive as soon as its investigation was complete.

The confirmation means Ubisoft is the latest publisher to make its return to Steam after striking out on its own - or elsewhere, such as the rival Epic Games Store.

Rumours of the game's existence began in summer, when it was accidentally let slip by Windows Central. Speculation on a new Crash Bandicoot game increased when Toys for Bob teased their 18th game, and fans are expecting to see a new entry in the series announced at The Game Awards next month.

The prototype was leaked yesterday by YouTuber Liam Robertson, for reasons he described as "historical interest". A short snippet of gameplay is shown along with concept arts. Robertson reiterated throughout the video that the footage shown comes from a very early version of the project, and that it is "not representative of what the game could look like if it releases".

Sharing her story on Twitter, composer Jessica Mao stated she "worked on the editing/arrangement/implementation of the Freya chase scene" as well as the "Thor boss fight music".


However, despite her input, Mao said her name was not included in the game's end credits as her contribution to Ragnarök didn't hit the "minimum criteria"  required (although Mao is unsure what "this criteria could be").

The game's current state is far from perfect, leading to plenty of glitches, jankiness and sometimes full on Bethesda-level comedy horror.
Personally, I picked up the game precisely for that experience (I am having fun playing the game also!) but sadly I've not encountered anything funkier than a T-pose during my time with Violet so far. Luckily for me, there are countless other people who've been sharing their witness accounts on Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its release just shy of two weeks ago, there has been a lot of chatter about God of War Ragnarök. This has ranged from whether or not there should be a PETA friendly mode included in the game, to Kratos' atonement for his past behaviour.


One thing that has really struck a chord is the amount of help Ragnarök's companions give when players are trying to solve puzzles. Many fans feel that, really, it would be better if said companions just held on to their advice for that little bit longer than they ultimately choose to. 


For example, much like many others, I like to venture off the game's main path every so often to see if there are any treasures tucked away I could miss if I left the area too soon. (This is all just standard exploration, not a sign that I don't have a clue what I am doing. Honestly, it is.) Early on in the game I took one step away from Atreus and was swiftly told I was going the wrong way. "I think this wheel over here needs to turn," he called after my retreating footsteps.

<p>&#8220;If we can recover the RSA-512 Public Key from the registry, we can crack it and get the 256-bit AES Key that encrypts the files!&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;The challenge was that they delete the [public key] once the files are fully encrypted. Memory analysis gave us about a 5-minute window after files were encrypted to retrieve this public key.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

This is why Switch game images have appeared on the site, which has since received a DMCA takedown notice, Games Radar reported.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Impressive physical sales in the UK have made Pokémon Scarlet and Violet the biggest boxed video game launch of the year. Previously, this accolade was held by FIFA 23.


This has also won Scarlet and Violet the title of being the UK's second biggest boxed Pokémon launch of all time. The biggest is still that of the 3DS's Sun and Moon (although, due to sale prices, charts firm GfK states Scarlet and Violet has generated more money than Sun and Moon did during its launch week). 


Per GamesIndustry.biz, the first week of sales for Scarlet and Violet (at least physically, as Nintendo does not share digital sales) are 25 percent bigger than those of Sword and Shield, 70 percent bigger than the Diamond and Pearl remakes and 56 percent bigger than this year's other big Pokémon offering, Arceus.

The NX name was used by Nintendo to refer to the Switch both internally and publicly, as the company began to drum up excitement for the Switch's unveiling. (And because in the Wii U era, there wasn't much else to get excited about.)

Whilst its unknown how widespread the issue is, videos posted to social media show plenty have been on the receiving end of the frustrating glitch and it's currently unclear if it's just a random occurrence or something sneaky players can turn on and off at will (thanks, PCGN).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Valhalla will not be getting a New Game+ mode, even though it's a "highly requested feature".

Whilst developer Ubisoft acknowledged that the "news will come as a disappointment" to some players, because of Valhalla's "very different structure from its predecessors", the open-world Viking game will be the first Assassin's Creed game not to feature an option to boot up a New Game+ run.

"Assassin's Creed Valhalla has been built as a unique Assassin’s Creed experience, one that is very different from its predecessors in its structure, offering new ways of engaging with the world and its characters," Ubisoft explained in a blog post (thanks, GamesRadar+).

<p>The neural stem cells they tracked behaved eerily similar to the way these cells behave in vertebrates during the development of their nervous system.</p>
<p>It suggests that vertebrates and cephalopods, despite diverging from each other 500 million years ago, not only are using similar mechanisms to make their big brains but that this process and the way the cells act, divide, and are shaped may essentially layout the blueprint required develop this kind of nervous system...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Cookstar has been embroiled in trouble ever since its release on Switch in March 2020, which saw it quickly disappear from Nintendo's eShop and physical stores - a move later revealed to be due to a licensing dispute between Office Create and publisher Planet Entertainment.


Office Create claimed Planet Entertainment had refused to correct what it saw as a "wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality and content of the game" during development, despite being contractually obligated to do so, and had instead proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without Office Create's approval.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortality, the acclaimed investigative Hollywood mystery from Her Story developer Sam Barlow, is now available on iOS and Android via Netflix.


Immortality tells the story of Marissa Marcel, a (fictional) actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.


It's up to players to find out what happened to Marcel, which, as in Barlow's previous games, involves slowly piecing together events by scouring through reams of FMV video. But while Her Story featured faux police interview footage and Telling Lies chose "hacked" webcam video as its medium of choice, Immortality asks players to dig through an archive of film and behind-the-scenes footage, using a machine resembling an old-fashioned Moviola editing device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves' tides are a-turning once more, and next week's Season 8 promises to be a bonanza for battle-hardened pirates, delivering an impressively exhaustive new "PvP on demand" system that, among other things, will see ships diving beneath the waves.


Core to Season 8 is a new faction system, enabling players to sign up to either the Pirate Lord's Guardians of Fortune or Flameheart's Servants of the Flame using the new Hourglass of Fate found on the Captain's Table of every ship.


Once active, players can either represent their faction simply by taking on any opposing crews they spot in the world, or they can use the war map to immediately begin matchmaking to find an equally skilled opposing crew. It's even possible to fight crews larger than your own if you're feeling particularly confident in your PvP abilities.

<blockquote><p>A cybersecurity expert examines how the powerful game whatever system is put before them, leaving it to others to cover the cost.</p>
<p>Schneier, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School and author of such books as <i>Data and Goliath</i> and <i>Click Here To Kill Everybody</i>, regularly challenges his students to write down the first 100 digits of pi, a nearly impossible task­&#8212;but not if they cheat, concerning which he admonishes, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get caught.&#8221; Not getting caught is the aim of the hackers who exploit the vulnerabilities of systems of all kinds. Consider right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who located a hack in the tax code: &#8220;Because he was one of the founders of PayPal, he was able to use a $2,000 investment to buy 1.7 million shares of the company at $0.001 per share, turning it into $5 billion&#8212;all forever tax free.&#8221; It was perfectly legal&#8212;and even if it weren&#8217;t, the wealthy usually go unpunished. The author, a fluid writer and tech communicator, reveals how the tax code lends itself to hacking, as when tech companies like Apple and Google avoid paying billions of dollars by transferring profits out of the U.S. to corporate-friendly nations such as Ireland, then offshoring the “disappeared” dollars to Bermuda, the Caymans, and other havens. Every system contains trap doors that can be breached to advantage. For example, Schneier cites &#8220;the Pudding Guy,&#8221; who hacked an airline miles program by buying low-cost pudding cups in a promotion that, for $3,150, netted him 1.2 million miles and &#8220;lifetime Gold frequent flier status.&#8221; Since it was all within the letter if not the spirit of the offer, &#8220;the company paid up.&#8221; The companies often do, because they’re gaming systems themselves. &#8220;Any rule can be hacked,&#8221; notes the author, be it a religious dietary restriction or a legislative procedure. With technology, &#8220;we can hack more, faster, better,&#8221; requiring diligent monitoring and a demand that everyone play by rules that have been hardened against tampering...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The lawsuit was filed on 11th November by Lucas Genova to the US District Court for the Northern District of California.

Why does Microsoft want this P in particular?

The result is rather hilarious, with Ziccs later encountering one of his passengers in the Gulag. Tragically, Ziccs had eliminated his former customer and apologised for it.

Naka, you  may recall, worked with the company for a brief stint, creating platformer Balan Wonderworld. 


Naka, 57, is accused of purchasing shares worth 2.8m yen (around £16.8k) in Aiming, a Japanese developer which Square Enix partnered with to make a Dragon Quest mobile game, before the company's involvement was public knowledge.

SMS Protect is a system first rolled out in Overwatch 2 that is designed to stop banned players from creating new accounts and continuing to play. It was later extended to Call of Duty.


The system was controversial at launch as players with prepaid phone numbers were unable to enroll. This disproportionately affected those on the lower end of the income scale who are unable to, or simply cannot afford a pay monthly phone contract.

Star Wars: Squadrons is something of a spiritual successor to LucasArts' beloved X-Wing and TIE Fighter games. It's set during the final days of the Galactic Empire, after the events of Return of the Jedi, and sees players engaging in deep space dogfights, both in multiplayer and in a bit of a solo campaign mode. There's even VR support if you're appropriately equipped.


Eurogamer enjoyed Star Wars: Squadrons when it released back in 2020, awarding it a Recommended badge and describing it as "an immersive space sim that's dazzling in VR [and] an exhilarating multiplayer experience, even if the story feels pedestrian."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crystal Dynamics has told fans it hears them "loudly and clearly" after a recent survey gauging their views on a potential Legacy of Kain revival received an overwhelmingly positive response.


Back in October, Crystal Dynamics launched a detailed questionnaire asking if the community would be interested in seeing the dark fantasy action-adventure series - which spanned five titles between 1996 and 2003 - make a comeback.


And the response, it turns out, was substantial. "In the past, we've found that surveys typically get between 1,000 and 3,000 responses," Crystal Dynamics and Eidos CEO Phil Rogers explained during parent company Embracer Group’s latest earnings call (thanks CVG), "but when we asked folk about Legacy of Kain, we received over 100,000 responses."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actor Scott Porter, who played Harry Osborn in Marvel's Spider-Man, has said he won't be reprising the role in Insomniac Games' upcoming PlayStation 5 sequel.


Porter - who recently portrayed Heimdall in God of War: Ragnarok - was heard in audio logs but only rarely glimpsed as Osborn in the first Spider-Man. However, post-credits sequences found in that game and its Mile Morales follow-up appeared to be setting the character up as Venom in Insomniac's "darker" Marvel's Spider-Man 2.


Given that Insomniac has already teased Venom as a major antagonist in next year's sequel, it seemed a distinct possibility Porter would also be making a return, but the actor has confirmed otherwise in a now-deleted tweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks the 20th anniversary of Ubisoft's much-loved (but distressingly absent) Splinter Cell series, and to mark the occasion the publisher has shared a smattering of concept art for its upcoming - but apparently still "very early" in development - remake.


All this comes via a special 20th anniversary developer roundtable video, culminating in a look at the future of the franchise. There's a brief mention of the Netflix animated series - which was announced last June and still in the works despite radio silence since then - and, of course, mention of the eagerly anticipated Splinter Cell reboot.


Ubisoft announced its remake -  described as a ground-up remake - last December, with producer Matt West saying, "We're going to update it visually, as well as some of the design elements to match player comfort and expectations, and we are going to keep it linear like the original games, not make it open world."

Speaking to IndieWire, Leguizamo recalled how his directors Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton "fought really hard for [him] to be the lead because [he] was a Latin man".


The actor stated that the studio had not initially wanted him to be a lead, but the directors' push to cast him eventually worked - something Leguizamo called "such a breakthrough" for the industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has, somehow, been a full year since Battlefield 2042 launched, and while it'd be premature to say DICE's shooter has bounced back from a disastrous launch it's certainly on firmer ground than it's been for a while. The belated launch of Season One in June was a small step in the right direction, while August's Season Two took bigger, bolder strides. Season Three, which kicks off on November 22nd, promises even more in the most radical season yet. 


What's most promising is the influx of players that should come as Battlefield 2042 hits Game Pass and EA Play, hopefully ensuring once sparse servers are fully-populated. It's part of a bigger push to get people playing Battlefield 2042, with free play periods for everyone across all platforms across December - on Xbox you can play for nada from December 1st-4th, on PC from December 1st-5th and on PlayStation from December 16th-23rd. 


Season Three - which has been dubbed Escalation - also makes some big changes, with the most profound being a return of sorts of the traditional class system to Battlefield, with specialists now being grouped by their roles. There's a new specialist in the mix, too, with Rasheed Zain joining the fray. He's a double-amputee whose traits include a faster health recharge and an airburst launcher.

But the PC version of Arkham City has not had a remastered edition - something which modder GPUnity set out to change.

38-year-old Taisuke Sazaki, whose video game credits include work on numerous Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts titles, allegedly bought shares in Japanese development company Aiming shortly before Square Enix publicly announced the studio was working on a new Dragon Quest mobile title.

Nippon reports that Sazaki acquired shares worth 20.8m yen (around £125k) between December 2019 and February 2020, after allegedly hearing details of Aiming's project.

More promising still is the news that Derek Kolstad, creator and lead writer of the hugely-lucrative John Wick franchise, remains attached, and will reportedly develop its script and act as a producer.

The code in question is a string of scripting functions, as shared on reddit. It includes references to game elements like camera, graphics and cutscenes, as well as gangs and DLC. 


On its own, the leak isn't particularly enlightening about the next game in the series, but Rockstar's swift takedown proves the legitimacy of the recent leak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saints Row developer Volition will become part of Borderlands maker Gearbox, Embracer announced today. 


The announcement by Embracer - the parent company of both studios - comes on the same day Volition finally released the "Bright Future" update for its beleagured Saints Row reboot, which belatedly fixes several hundred bugs present since the game's launch back in August.


For fans who enjoyed Saints Row, Volition's move places the future of that franchise in doubt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty players have found an easy way to unlock the M13B Assault Rifle, which is  controversially locked behind a challenge that can only be completed in the new DMZ game mode.  


Even more controversial is the fact that extracting the weapon only unlocks it for the player who picked it up instead of the entire squad. This means your squad will have to make repeated trips back to unlock it for everyone. 


Fortunately, it appears you won't have to after all. As you only need to extract with the gun at the end of a round, a squad mate can drop the weapon earned in a previous match for you to pick up. All you need to do now is extract safely and you unlock the weapon (thanks, PC Gamer).

The update was rolled out by Ubisoft on 8th November, and on the game's official website the developer listed the features included. The main feature was a new QB initiative  which has been in development for several months. "While we cannot share details of the update in order to protect its integrity," Ubisoft wrote, "we're confident of the solution we've been able to put in place."
The QB feature was rolled back yesterday to allow Ubisoft to work on fixes for it. In the eight days the feature was live, players took a look at the files to try and understand how the measure worked.

As with previous entries in the series, the game concludes with a trailer for the series' next title - which has already been posted online. However, unlike previous entries to the series, the upcoming game - known as Directive 8020 - looks set to take players to space. 


Yes, this will be yet another game to add to the ever-growing space-horror genre which is having quite the renaissance of late (looking at you Callisto Protocol, Dead Space Remake and Fort Solis).

WOW, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm and the StarCraft series will become unplayable in China from 23rd January 2023, when NetEase's current license expires. Diablo Immortal is unaffected.


This morning, NetEase president Simon Zhu - who says he's spent "10,000 hours" playing the above games - reacted to the announcement in an extraordinary statement posted publicly via LinkedIn, where he blamed behind the scenes "damage" done by a "jerk" - who he left unnamed.

Back in May 2020, Doom Eternal executive producer Marty Stratton took to Reddit to address "speculation and criticism" surrounding the the game's soundtrack's release, and admitting to "eroded trust" between Gordon and id Software.


Then, last week, Gordon took to Medium to share a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton's claims, releasing screenshots of emails and legal documents as evidence of the true timeline of events. He went on to allege abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton.

Discord server voice chat support for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S initially launched in September, but was somewhat hampered by its convoluted mobile app requirements.


Today's Xbox update streamlines the whole process, meaning users simply need to launch a Discord server via their console's Parties & chats > Discord option then pick a voice channel from their available Discord servers - and as long their Discord and Xbox accounts are linked, they'll be able to join that channel directly, no additional mobile app faff required.

This anonymised data - consisting of chat logs labelled by behaviours, from neutral to racist and sexist - will be used to better train AI-based preemptive moderation tools, helping them more effectively recognise and parse, and so detect and mitigate, disruptive behaviour in-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans have already started combing through all the new content coming to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 with the arrival of Season One tonight, but one small detail has taken over fan discussion.


Some Modern Warfare 2 weapons will be locked behind challenges that can only be completed on other game modes. Most notably, the M13B Assault Rifle is locked behind a challenge in the game's new DMZ mode which will be releasing alongside Warzone 2.0. 


According to screenshots posted by the community, players can unlock the weapon by "defeating the chemist in the radiation zone of DMZ and extracting his dropped weapon."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak's next free Title Update is right around the corner, and it's a good 'un, adding new monster variants, expanded uses for AI hunters, plus a host of welcome tweaks and refinements when it launches next Thursday, 24th November.


On the monster front, there're no brand-new additions in Title Update 3, but some existing favourites do get a bit of a makeover. Elder Dragons Kushala Daora and Teostra, for instance, have now shaken off the affliction, only to emerge in Risen form - both available at Master Rank 120 or higher - causing them to become much more menacing when their anger peaks. 


Then there's the Chaotic Gore Magala, unlocked at Master Rank 10 or higher. This unfortunate beast has failed to complete the skin-shedding process that would normally see it turn into the Shagaru Magala, leaving it in a "deformed" halfway state that's able to use the attacks of both creatures. Sometimes, says Capcom, it will display "expressions of intense agony".

But, yes, it really has been that long. On 15th November 2002, Xbox Live (now known, at least officially, as the Xbox network) arrived in our lives, adding online capability to the original Xbox. 


The service's popularity saw a steady increase after the launch of Halo 2 and, needless to say, Microsoft has not looked back since. By January 2021, Microsoft reported there were more than 100m Xbox network subscribers (with this figure including those signed up through the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription tier).

"Now, it is at some level, because I have shipped games too early. We have experienced shipping games too early."

Raft, if you're unfamiliar, first gained attention as a free itch.io prototype back in 2016. After a two year spell expanding the game's core survival loop - in which players chart their raft across a vast ocean, reeling in food, supplies, and building materials to turn their initially tiny vessel into a veritable sea-faring palace - Redbeet launched into Steam early access in 2018.


Raft has come a long way since then, gaining the likes of online co-op, explorable islands, underwater reefs, crop growing, cooking, animal care, and even a full story campaign for its version 1.0 release on PC, which arrived this June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're still impatiently awaiting Amazon's live-action take on the Fallout universe, you might like a look at a newly released Fallout 76 fan project, admirably capturing the ambience of Bethesda's long-running series without, I assume, a budget of 150m Bezosbucks.


Created by YouTube channel Infectious Designer (which has also produced live-action shorts inspired by the likes of Half-Life, Killzone, and Watch Dogs), the Fallout 76 concept trailer serves up two minutes and 35 seconds of impressively realised Fallout splendour, replicating the series distinctive retro-futuristic aesthetic both before and after the nuclear apocalypse.


Now, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on Fallout 76 - about the only thing I can say with any confidence is that it's the 76th game in the Fallout series - but even to my eyes there's some lovely attention to detail in Infectious Designer's concept trailer, ranging from an authentic Pip-Boy and a hulking Vault suit to what I think is a CGI Scorchbeast. Oh and there's enough Nuka-Cola to rot the teeth clean out of your skull.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox boss Phil Spencer has revealed Microsoft's decision to "pivot away" from its previously announced Game Pass streaming box earlier this year was due to pricing concerns, with the company unable to get the device within its desired $99-$129 price bracket.


Speaking in the latest episode of The Verge's Decoder podcast (as spotted by VGC), Spencer explained, "The console we built that now people have seen...was more expensive than we wanted it to be when we actually built it out with the hardware that we had inside."


Microsoft never formally revealed this version of its streaming box, codenamed Keystone - a standalone device utilising a familiar Xbox user interface, according to Spencer - but it did set tongues wagging when a prototype showed up in a photo of the Xbox boss' office last month.

12 of the 18 leaders featured in the DLC are new to Civilization 6, while six are described as "new takes" on existing leaders. Each is said to offer "surprising new or updated abilities", alongside "inventive agendas that'll change the way you play".


Up first are Abraham Lincoln (representing the United States), Queen Nzinga Mbande (Kongo), and Sultan Saladin (Arabia), all arriving as part of the diplomacy focused Great Negotiations Pack on 21st November. 2K is yet to provide launch dates for the Leader Pass' five remaining DLC releases, but all are due before the end of March 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free-to-play fighter MultiVersus' second season of content is almost upon us, and, in preparation for its arrival later today, developer Player First Games has detailed what players can expect alongside its new Battle Pass and associated rewards - including progression refinements, a new Big Head mode, and an in-game shop.


Much of Season 2's launch day changes focus on the Battle Pass experience, with Player First Games having tweaked progression so all tiers now offer rewards. It's also tuned the number of points required to complete each tier so the Battle Pass feels "engaging and rewarding".


As for those rewards, Season 2's Battle Pass unlocks the Baker Street Tom and Jerry skin at tier 50 of the free track, and the paid track features Astronaut Velma at tier 1, Tea Time Reindog at tier 42, and Maestro Bugs Bunny at tier 50.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin Bloom, the social walking game from Pokémon Go maker Niantic, recently passed its first birthday and is now hosting a special event themed around Pikmin 3. 


This event in particular caught my eye, as it will allow you to grow the series' original Red, Blue and Yellow Pikmin varieties dressed up in the space suits of Pikmin 3's main characters: Alph, Brittany, and Charlie.


If you're unfamiliar, Pikmin Bloom lets you potter about your neighbourhood growing flower trails and picking up Pikmin seedlings that can grow into Pikmin wearing costumes. If you're near a beach, for example, the Pikmin could be wearing a shell, or a discarded bottle cap if collected near a corner shop. It's a collection game and a glorified pedometer - and a cute nudge to get off your sofa once in a while.

Until recently the streamer, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr, was working with Sky Sports, helping with its broadcasts of matches for the English Premier League.


However, the channel has now removed almost all traces of the streamer from its social media feeds (although some still remain).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox boss Phil Spencer has further clarified his position regarding Call of Duty's future on PlayStation following Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


Speaking via the Decoder podcast, Spencer said the company intended to sell Call of Duty on PlayStation "for as long as players want to play Call of Duty on PlayStation". 


Back in September, Spencer made a written commitment to PlayStation's Jim Ryan that Call of Duty will remain on PlayStation. However, Ryan labelled the statement "inadequate on many levels," while others point out that a commitment is not a legally binding contract.

US District Court Judge Thomas Zilly has ruled against AimJunkies' eyebrow-raising bid to countersue Bungie for allegedly accessing its computers - a retaliatory move which the cheating firm claimed amounted to the Destiny maker hacking it.


Now, a new ruling (first reported by Torrentfreak), has dismissed AimJunkies' defence and left Bungie looking likely to win its original complaint, which alleged that AimJunkie's cheating software infringed on Destiny's copyright and trademarks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Details of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0's Battle Pass have been revealed early, after the game's regional account in Australia and New Zealand posted the trailer before promptly taking it down. 


However, the trailer was already captured and reposted across the web, revealing major changes to the franchise's battle pass system. 


Activision has abandoned the linear progression of previous seasons of Call of Duty, opting instead for a "combat map" which gives players a sense of choice of what they unlock. It isn't a particularly novel idea, with many other live service games already using a modular battle pass model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam versions of various recent Ubisoft games appear to be on the way, according to datamined store details which have popped up online. 


Earlier this month, a Steam version of Assassin's Creed Valhalla was spotted in Ubisoft Connect's database, prompting speculation the smash hit Viking adventure would finally arrive on Valve's PC storefront. To date, PC players have only been able to access Valhalla via Ubisoft's own launcher or the Epic Games Store.


A Steam version of Ubisoft sports title Roller Champions was also spotted - and today was also made briefly available to view on SteamDb, all but confirming the game will launch there. Roller Champions feels like it has struggled to find much of an audience to date; a Steam launch would certainly help it along.

PlayStation 4 and 5 owners searching for Warzone 2.0 last night were unable to find the download by searching "Call of Duty Warzone" in the PlayStation Store, while Steam users who own Modern Warfare 2 found no download whatsoever. 

Things are a little better on Xbox where Warzone 2.0 is discoverable with its own store page. Still, on closer inspection, the download confusingly also appears to bundle Modern Warfare 2 for free.

And the same mysterious update has also been added to Switch smash hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which Nintendo abandoned a year ago, after 18 months of patchy post-launch support.

According to Far From Home, over 80,000 people played the Forever Skies demo, resulting in a "wave of positive and constructive feedback" the studio wants to implement before launching into Early Access - something it was initially planning to do before the end of this year.


"On the surface everything seemed great," Far From Home says of its recent feedback. "83% of respondents rated the demo as 8/10 or above. But when we looked deeper, we started seeing things that a lot of players said they missed."

The original proof-of-concept demo - titled A Superman Style Flight Experience (UE5) - was created by Toybox Games' Tyson Butler-Boschma, utilising the City Sample from Epic Games' The Matrix Awakens as a sandbox for superhero flight. In April, Butler-Boschma made the playable demo freely available via itch.io, but unfortunately, it's here things begin to go awry.


At the start of November, Butler-Boschma was alerted to the fact an entity calling itself Hero Game Studios had taken his demo - a project he created "for fun to show what could be made" in Unreal Engine 5 - and started selling it on Steam under the name Heroes City Superman Edition with an asking price of $10.99 USD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarök portrays Kratos as a somewhat more level-headed god-killing powerhouse than in some of his past adventures which, to be honest, showed Sony's protagonist in a less, erm, morally sound light. Ok, ok, let's face it, Kratos was a bit of a knob in the past.


One NPC that would whole-heartily agree with me on this is the boat captain from the original God of War. Remember him? It is hard not to, as he was certainly put through it by Kratos. 

Please note, some of the below could be considered spoilers. If you're still reading and want to go into the God of War series blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

The revamped role-playing classic will offer the title of "Flamescale" for characters whose date of birth is listed as between 2nd and 25th May. However, the game then tells you "Flamescale" is actually not allowed, as it contains "banned words".


This issue, picked up by fan Choojermelon on Twitter (thanks, PCGamer) appears to stem from the name's inclusion of "mescal", the illegal psychedelic enjoyed by Hunter S. Thompson and others.

The demake trailer in question comes from creator Jackarte. It sees heroes Kratos and Atreus, as well as Ragnarök's towering god Tyr and the vengeful Freya, all reimagined as PlayStation 1 characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An European Commission staff member has raised eyebrows for their public comments on the organisation's ongoing investigation into Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover bid - and prompted the EU Commission itself to respond. 


Last week, Commission member Ricardo Cardoso tweeted to say that the organisation was "working to ensure that you will still be able to play Call of Duty on other consoles (including my PlayStation)."


On the one hand, the comment simply describes the situation as Microsoft has too - that Activision's blockbuster shooter franchise will remain on Sony platforms "as long as there's a PlayStation out there to ship to". On the other, fans expressed surprise a Commission staff member was discussing the matter publicly, and expressing an opinion which seemed mostly concerned with their own console choice.

Amy was first introduced to the series in Sonic The Hedgehog CD as a love interest, but their relationship was always implied to be unrequited. Sonic is far too busy going really fast to have a relationship.


But YouTuber Faz Faz has discovered unused dialogue in the game's files in which Sonic ponders their relationship, spotted by TheGamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite has stunned fans by signalling an early end to its third map at the conclusion of its current season, via a live event named Fracture set to take place at 9pm UK time on 3rd December. 


Fracture was teased tonight by developer Epic Games at the conclusion of Fortnite Champion Series, its first major in-person Fortnite competition for several years. A title card for Fracture appeared after the tournament's trophy presentation, simply listing the upcoming live event's date, time, and description as the "Chapter 3 Finale event". 


Each in-game "Chapter" of Fortnite has so far concluded with a complete reboot of the battle royale's beloved Island. After two years and 10 seasons, the game's original Island got sucked into a black hole in October 2019. After another two years, this time divided into eight seasons, the game's second Island was flipped over to reveal the current map lying underneath in December 2021.

In an interview with IGN, Diablo 4 director Joe Shely and general manager Rod Fergusson opened up on what the new adventure has in store for fans of the franchise, as well as give a little insight into how the game's storytelling mechanics will differ from the Diablo games that have come before it.

"One of the concerns about putting 'open world' in a big neon and flashing that sign is that people have that notion of Breath of the Wild, 'oh, it’s completely organic and I can go anywhere and do anything'," Fergusson said, as transcribed by NME.

"The good news is that we’re on track for release in 2023 – and we’ll have more on that in December," the blog confirms. "Acts 2 and 3 of the story are being actively playtested to ensure they’re up to the same level of polish and you’ll soon discover that there’s much more in the works (or already complete) than what you’ll encounter in an Early Access playthrough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sony unveiled release details for PSVR2 earlier this month, it only confirmed two launch day titles - Horizon: Call of the Mountain and Quest 2 port Cities VR: Enhanced Edition. However, it turns out No Man's Sky fans also have something to look forward to, with Hello Games confirming to Eurogamer that its previously announced PSVR2 update will be arriving alongside Sony's new hardware on 22nd February next year.


Hello Games revealed a PSVR2 update for No Man's Sky was in the works back in June, teasing an enhanced VR experience that would utilise the power of PlayStation 5, PSVR2, and its new Sense controllers to build on the game's 2019 VR implementation, and "take that sense of immersion and believability up by several major notches."


Evidence that PSVR2 owners wouldn't have to wait long for No Man's Sky's promised VR upgrade first surfaced earlier this week when sharp-eyed PS5 Store users (by which I mean Eurogamer's resident VR aficionado Ian Higton) spotted an updated description on Hello Games' PSVR2 reveal trailer, pointing to a February 2022 release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a new book coming out in February. It&#8217;s about hacking.</p>
<p><i><a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/">A Hacker&#8217;s Mind: How the Powerful Bend Society&#8217;s Rules, and How to Bend them Back</a></i> isn&#8217;t about hacking computer systems; it&#8217;s about hacking more general economic, political, and social systems. It generalizes the term <i>hack</i> as a means of subverting a system&#8217;s rules in unintended ways.</p>
<p>What sorts of system? Any system of rules, really. Take the tax code, for example. It&#8217;s not computer code, but it&#8217;s a series of algorithms&#8212;supposedly deterministic&#8212;that take a bunch of inputs about your income and produce an output that&#8217;s the amount of money you owe. This code has vulnerabilities; we call them loopholes. It has exploits; those are tax avoidance strategies. And there is an entire industry of black-hat hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the tax code: we call them accountants and tax attorneys...</p>]]></summary>

Conroy, whose acting career began in the late 70s, first voiced Batman in Fox Kids' Batman: The Animated series, which would go on to run for 85 episodes between 1992 and 1995. His portrayal has remained a fan favourite ever since, with Conroy later voicing the role across a multitude of mediums, including 15 films.


In video games, he made his mark on the likes of developer Rocksteady's acclaimed Arkham trilogy, NetherRealm's superhero fighter Injustice, and, more recently, MultiVersus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week we heard the unusual news that player-versus-player MMO Crowfall, which launched in the summer of 2021, will be taken offline and taken back to the drawing board, where it will be rethought. There's no word on how long this will take, only that "nothing is off the table" in terms of what potentially may change.
Game operator Monumental said this was because it didn't have the headspace or resources to rethink the game while it was running it, and suggested Crowfall could return looking quite different indeed. If, that is, it returns. Crowfall has struggled since launch, and it was sold to Monumental in December 2021 partly because of this - because it needed significant change.
I cannot ever remember an MMO ever doing something similar. In this article, I talk to Monumental about the decision and what it could mean. But first, a bit of background.

The amount of detail Sony Santa Monica has put into its game is astounding, from animals scurrying through trees right down to Kratos' wrinkled elbows. But some of these details and Easter eggs are easily missed, so here is a small selection of ones that I have noticed so far. 

Please note, some of these details could be considered spoilers. If you're still reading and want to go into the game blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

Developer Sony Santa Monica recently stated that, while a photo mode would not be available on the game's launch, it would be coming further down the line by way of an update. This is much the same as with 2018's God of War. 


However, prolific modder Speclizer (who was responsible for unearthing the canned multiplayer map files in the Last of Us Part 2) has managed to find Ragnarök's photo mode and get it working.

The game has been optimised for Xbox Series X/S to hit 60fps according to Microsoft, but on Series S it runs at 30fps with no performance mode option to change this.

In addition to this little snippet of text, Bautista also shared old clips of himself promoting his part in Gears of War 5, where he was featured as a free unlockable skin for the multiplayer (you can see the full gameplay reveal trailer for this below).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Thursday means another glimpse ahead at the Epic Games Store's next set of weekly freebies, with Evil Dead: The Game and tactical turn-based RPG Dark Deity both now confirmed to be free from Thurday, 17th November.


Evil Dead: The Game, which released as an Epic exclusive back in May, is developer Saber Interactive's spin on the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre. It sees four human Survivors (picking from a range of familiar Evil Dead characters, armed with everything from chainsaws to boomsticks) roaming a spooky forest in search of artefacts, while a fifth player gives chase as one of four powerful demons - the Warlord, Puppeteer, Necromancer, or Plaguebringer, all able to command undead armies of their own.


And it's good fun, effectively marrying the gleefully cartoonish horror of Sam Raimi's beloved franchise to a solidly entertaining multiplayer game.

"With great power at stake, a group of mages, fighters, and thieves goes head to head against a sinister force possessing a dangerous artifact," Netflix teases beneath its newly released Absolution trailer. "Fear. Guilt. Pain. Can Miriam push aside her feelings to complete her mission - or will the trauma looming over her past finally catch up with her?".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mick Gordon, known for his work on soundtracks for several games including the Wolfenstein and Doom series, has released a statement in response to accusations made against him by Marty Stratton in May 2020.

In April 2020, Gordon distanced himself from the soundtrack album for Doom Eternal after it received criticisms from fans on its quality. This led to speculation from fans about its production, and Stratton, who was working as executive producer on Doom Eternal, posted an open letter to the Doom subreddit to address rumours. 

A year and a half later, Gordon has written a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton's claims, with screenshots of emails and legal documents (with sensitive information removed) as evidence of the true timeline of events. He posted his statement on Medium, in which he alleged abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton. Gordon stated he has released it to defend himself, and urged people to not use it as an excuse for a hate campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're discussing the now-widespread leaks of new Pokémon designs from the upcoming Scarlet and Violet games.

Pokémon details always leak - often months before launch, but especially in the last few weeks as retail copies begin appearing in the wild. Should you look at spoilers? For some, uncovering the many unannounced creatures as they play is a core part of the games. For others, knowing what your new Starter Pokémon will eventually evolve into is a big deal.  
Whichever side of the debate you're on, there's no doubting the level of interest in new Pokémon designs - seen this week when the final evolution of Starter cat creature Sprigatito sparked an avalanche of dubious fanart after an image was posted by a leaker. Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

This included a little bit more on its brand-new "experience" known as DMZ.


This Escape From Tarkov-inspired mode is described as an "open-world, narrative-focused extraction mode where Operator squads have free rein to complete faction-based missions, take on additional side objectives, engage with enemy Operators or AI combatants, and search for valuable items, all while fighting to survive toward exfiltration".

The long-awaited Forge offering officially arrived yesterday as part of Halo Infinite's Winter Update, and of course Blood Gulch was one of the first things on anyone's mind to recreate.


Halo fan Epsilon_church_ posted word of their creation to Twitter yesterday evening and invited others to try the map for themselves. Amusingly, however, it needed to be named "Coagulation", as "BloodGulch" was blocked.

A detailed FAQ page on the process is now available for Stadia customers to browse, but in a nutshell it boils down to: sit tight. 


Google will attempt to refund you for most things you bought to do with Stadia - except for the Stadia Pro subscription. It'll keep your money for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Sony gave its PlayStation Plus subscription service a makeover, adding three new tiers for users to pick between. 


The cheapest of these tiers is Essential and is basically what PlayStation Plus once was. Users get online play, some other smaller perks and free PlayStation titles every month. Then we have Extra. This middle-ground tier includes everything that comes with Essential, but with the bonus of a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games to have a go at.


Then, finally, we have the most expensive of these tiers, known as Premium. This was marketed as a way for users to replay some of PlayStation's classic games from days gone by. The service covers every PlayStation console - from the original PS1 through to the PS5, as well as the PSP and, thanks to streaming, PS3 support.

The blue blur is known for going really fast, so it's appreciated that the developers took care to not let that negatively affect players.


Producer Sachiko Kawamura told Famitsu that the QA team were integral to this process and that it was important to take this aspect of the game seriously (thanks Siliconera).

A verified "Nintendo of America" account went viral last night as it posted an image of the company's mascot Mario giving the middle finger. The handle, @nIntendoofus, has now had their account suspended - but not until their tweets had been widely shared.

Ditching the linear level progression still used by most games, Call of Duty's new battle pass will adopt a system reminiscent of that seen in Fortnite, where players have more freedom in which battle pass items they can unlock and when.


Activision's battle pass overhaul presents itself as a multi-sector map, with players able to unlock five items in each of its 20 sectors using earned Battle Token Tier skips. These tokens can either unlock more items within an already available sector or unlock adjacent sectors.

Texas will be American Truck Simulator's 11th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. It was confirmed to be in development last March, but SCS warned the expansion could be a long time coming given the sheer effort required to bring one of the US' largest states into the game.


However, with Texas' arrival now less than a week away, SCS has given us our best look yet at the expansion's numerous familiar sights - its newly released  launch trailer featuring the likes of Austin, Houston, and a whole lot of countryside.

There's a lot more where that came from though, with Nintendo choosing to highlight over 20 promising new indie titles heading to Switch before next summer is through - a few of which, such as the wonderful Rogue Legacy 2, are out today. Read on for the full round-up!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disco Elysium game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have published an explosive open letter to fans detailing their ousting from ZA/UM, the game's development studio.
Most eye-opening is the claim ZA/UM's new majority shareholder, an Estonian firm named Tütreke OÜ, allegedly obtained control of the company through fraud. Tütreke OÜ is a "vehicle" for two Estonian businessmen, the pair wrote, namely Ilmar Kompus (now ZA/UM's CEO) and Tõnis Haavel (who was previously "convicted for defrauding investors on a different matter in 2007").


At the same time, ZA/UM CEO Kompus has published, via Estonian newspaper Ekspress, allegations of mismanagement by Kurvitz and a previous minority shareholder of the company, Saandar Taal. The pair are accused of "belittling women and co-workers" and creating a "toxic environment". Kompus also states the pair had been "intending to steal IP" - namely, Disco Elysium - with an eye to departing the studio and working elsewhere.

Servers for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin, and Dark Souls 3 were "temporarily deactivated" back in January following reports the games were vulnerable to Remote Code Execution exploits began to make headlines.


Several weeks later, Bandai Namco offered an update, saying the issue would't be addressed until after the release of Elden Ring, but Dark Souls fans' patience was finally rewarded in August when online features for Dark Souls 3 were restored. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin followed in October, with the publisher promising to reactive servers for the original Dark Souls 2 at "a later date".

This is the game's first major update which Volition previously said would be used to prioritise fixes and improvements over new content. Last month, the studio said it had chosen to spend time bringing the existing game up to scratch - even though it would have "preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions".

"Significant effort and testing" has gone into fixing the game's co-op, Volition said today. Connectivity, map issues and rewards should all work more smoothly post-patch.

But one major criticism has been the distinct lack of diversity in its main cast.


Last week, director Naoki Yoshida addressed the lack of diversity in an interview. It fits the "isolated nature of this realm" he said, as well as the inspiration of Medieval Europe.

If you ever need reminding how popular Pokémon is, simply type one of the creatures' names into social media and see how many image results you get. This is true even for Pokémon so far only glimpsed in leaked screenshots from early copies, images of which Nintendo is busy scrubbing from the internet.


Fan art created from seeing these leaked images, though, is another matter. For example, this morning I learned the final evolution of Grass-type cat and Scarlet and Violet Starter Pokémon Sprigatito had leaked online after I saw someone on Twitter discussing its design. (And if you're still reading and want to go into the new games blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever played Destiny, you'll know of Telesto. This exotic weapon is a fan-favourite for its exploding purple projectiles - and also notorious for often being bugged. 


It's broken nature is so notorious, in fact, that Destiny developer Bungie has now added an Easter egg to the game where Telesto fails to properly fire - and instead sends its projectiles floating lazily into the sky while the weapon itself fizzes and sparks. (A simple reload clears the Easter egg, and the gun can then be used as normal.)


But while this appeared at first to be just a fun nod to Telesto's oft-bugged state, fans are now suggesting the Easter egg may hint at a further secret, as Destiny 2 heads towards the end of its current season.

The move will see Meta's overall workforce shrink by 13 percent, with some areas of the business impacted more than others. 


Specifically how this will impact the company's development of Meta Quest remains unclear, though Zuckerburg stated today that the company's "long-term vision for the metaverse" remained one of a small number of "high priority growth areas".

Since launch, Wordle's puzzles have drawn from the same list of five-letter words - originally totalling 2,315, but now down by six - with a new word solution being presented each day. Starting today, though, that word list will be fully curated by Wordle's new dedicated editor, Tracy Bennett.


"Wordle's gameplay will stay the same," the publication explains in its announcement, "and answers will be drawn from the same basic dictionary of answer words". However, Bennett will be responsible for making "some editorial adjustments to ensure that the game stays focused on vocabulary that’s fun, accessible, lively and varied."

In a statement on its website, the European Commission said it had made the decision after its preliminary investigation showed Microsoft's acquisition may "significantly reduce competition on the markets for the distribution of console and PC video games, including multi-game subscription services and/or cloud game streaming services, and for PC operating systems".


It drew particular attention to its concerns Microsoft has a "potential economic incentive" to prevent competitors from accessing Activision Blizzard's "high-profile and highly successful games" upon closure of the deal, specifically highlighting the Call of Duty series - something Microsoft has repeatedly insisted it will not do.

Next year's Awesome Games Done Quick runs from 8th-15th January, and will once again be an online-only event as organisers look to move its in-person component away from its usual haunt of Florida. Earlier this year, organisers said the state's "continued disregard for COVID-19's dangers... and an increased aggression towards LGBTQ+ individuals" made it impossible to provide a "safe and welcoming" event for all.


While the lack of an in-person event might be a disappointment for some, Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 will still feature an extensive speedrunning schedule, running 24 hours everyday across the week with an occasional pauses for breaks. As ever, it's an eclectic line-up - covering triple-A titles, smaller-scale indie offerings, retro classics, and other assorted oddities (I can't pretend I'm not immediately intrigued by a game called Salamander County Public Television) - and you can have a leisurely peruse on the Games Done Quick website.

Each game will feature a separate book of expedition records with rare Pokémon to track down, letting you retrace their steps to encounter them yourselves. However, it sounds like the Scarlet Book and the Violet Book will feature alternate versions of these Pokémon, depending on which version of the upcoming games you have.


Put more simply: today's trailer appears to show a pair of new evolutions for Donphan. One is primal looking with huge tusks, which you'll meet in Scarlet. One is futuristic-looking with dot-matrix eyes, which you'll meet in Violet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus VR and creator of the Oculus Rift, has designed a new VR headset to celebrate the popular light novel and anime series Sword Art Online which can also kill you.

The plot of Sword Art Online revolves around a massive multiplayer online role-playing game in VR, which is played using a headset called the NerveGear. A number of players get locked into the game and the NerveGear can't be removed whilst a player is still online. And (spoiler alert) it'll kill a player in real-life if they die in the game. 

Luckey revealed his own version of this headset, named the OQPNVG, in a blog post on 6th November, to coincide with the day the events of Sword Art Online begin. (@SAO_IRL on Twitter is dedicated to broadcasting the events of the series as if it was actually happening, if a murder headset isn't enough realism for you.)

The news was revealed by our partner site GamesIndustry.biz, and it sees an end to a series that debuted in 2015 - though one whose roots go back much further as a crowdfunded project brought to life by its community. 


Bandai Namco went on to publish the first three games in the series, with Project Cars 3 releasing in 2020 - several months after EA had acquired Slightly Mad Studios as part of its takeover of Codemasters.

In a statement posted to Twitter, developer Slightly Mad Studios blamed "expiring car and track licenses", but said existing owners would still be able to play both games, and multiplayer servers would remain available.

While this may still seem an impressive figure, it is a marked decrease from previous quarters and the lowest quarter in shipments that Grand Theft Auto 5 has had since its release in 2013. For comparison, in February of this year, the publisher shared it had sold 5m copies between then and the previous November. 


Even with this slow down in sales, the publisher stated the game has now sold more than 170m units worldwide.

For those closely following news around the announcement of the remake and its subsequent delays, there's not a lot new here. The game is still very much alive, Ubisoft promises, albeit no longer at its original development studio.


Still, the page is a handy place for fans to go for a bit of reassurance. Ubisoft has a habit of delaying games for years - looking at you Skull and Bones, and you Beyond Good & Evil 2, and you Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - without providing much proof they still exist.

Overall, Nintendo Switch has now sold 114.3m consoles worldwide, with another 6.68m sold over the last two quarters. 2.23m of these were of the original 2017 Switch, while Switch OLED sold 3.53m and Switch Lite sold 920k.


However, Nintendo admitted it had sold 19.2 percent fewer consoles year-on-year over the financial year so far - in part, it said, due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. In response, Nintendo has cut its Switch sales forecast for the year from 21m to 19m consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has detailed more of its plans for Call of Duty in 2023, saying next year will bring the series' "next full premium release" - a statement initially appearing to contradict previous reports there'd be no brand-new Call of Duty title in 2023.


According to Activision's newly revealed third quarter financial results, 2023 will bring "the most robust Call of Duty live operations to date, the next full premium release in the blockbuster annual series, and even more engaging free-to-play experiences across platforms".


It's the talk of the "next full premium release" that's caught people's attention, particularly in light of claims made by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier in February that Call of Duty wouldn't be getting a new mainline series entry in 2023 - marking the first time in just under two decades it had skipped an annual release. Schreier then expanded on those assertions last month, saying Activision would instead be "selling new stuff" for Modern Warfare 2 - "an expansion or something like that" including "campaign stuff".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over a decade and a half after a live-action Gears of War movie was first touted, Netflix has announced it's adapting The Coalition's cover shooter series for the small screen.


A Gear of War movie was first trumpeted back in 2007, when New Line Cinema purchased the rights for a live-action adaptation. However, its originally planned 2009 release date came and went, and the project has bounced around in development hell ever since - last resurfacing in 2019 when it was reported it would no longer even be set in the same universe as the games.


Whatever happened to that version of the adaptation, we may never know, as Netflix - on this, the 16th anniversary of the original Gears of War's release - has now announced a new partnership with current franchise stewards The Coalition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells, the acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, has thrown open its doors to welcome another batch of familiar gaming faces - from indie favourites including Hotline Miami, Shovel Knight, Terraria, and Slay the Spire - in its new Everyone is Here Vol. 2 update on PC.


A follow-up to last year's first Everyone is Here update - which featured crossovers with Hollow Knight, Hyper Light Drifter, Blasphemous, Guacamelee, Curse of the Dead Gods, and Skul: The Hero Slayer - Vol. 2 features guest appearances from another six titles.


Up first is Yacht Club Games' beloved retro platformer Shovel Knight - no stranger to crossovers and cameos - whose Dead Cells appearance takes the form of a new outfit and an accompanying Brutality weapon known as the King Scepter. THis lets players mimic King Knight, dashing around and bouncing on enemies' heads.

Youtube channel 64 Bits has released a demake video showing what Stray would look like if it had been released on a Game Boy. This includes textures and sounds, and to be honest, it looks great! 


The video itself offers a 'highlight reel' of Stray's opening chapters. It shows the titular stray cat's sudden separation from their clowder, and their descent into the chasm leading to an unpopulated underground city.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioWare has issued a small teaser and brief update on the status of its next Mass Effect game, in celebration of the franchise's annual N7 Day today,  7th November. 


A blog update from BioWare states that "pre-production development has been proceeding very well" as Mass Effect franchise veterans and newcomers work together to craft "characters and locations that you'll love, as well as revisiting many that you'll remember". 


That last line stuck out to me, as fan speculation continues on what to expect from this new entry into the franchise. From the off, in BioWare's 2020 reveal trailer for the project, fans were greeted by an older version of Liara - apparently centuries older than she appeared in the series' original trilogy. But that teaser also included hints we'd hear more about what's been going on in Andromeda - the setting for the series' most recent entry - as well.

A questionnaire on the Xbox Insider app, spotted by Windows Central, is gauging the potential popularity of new energy efficiency features on PC and console.



That includes the possibility of in-game features that can optimise settings (resolution, frame rate, etc) to save energy, and games automatically lowering frame rate or resolution when left idle or inactive.

The Easter egg in question is written in very, very, small text, and can be found on the side of one of the map's exhibits. 


While at first glance it may simply look like standard and somewhat generic writing informing in-game tourists about this and that, it is actually a note from one of the game's texture artists masquerading as part of the exhibition.

Speaking to the Friends Per Second Podcast, Microsoft's Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty praised the team which launched Halo Infinite after working through the pandemic to get the game done - but also admitted Microsoft had fallen short with its support for the game after its arrival.


"In December I think we had a peak of around 20 million players playing the game, and just kudos to the team for building and shipping a game during some pretty challenging times, right?" Booty said. "Last year - still in the midst of the pandemic, still everybody trying to figure out how to adapt to remote work and hybird work. I think if there's a worse-case condition for trying to get games done, it is the big multi-hundred person team trying to final a game. It went smack into that. So, kudos to shipping it.

The six-year old game is now well ahead of last year's beleagured Battlefield 2042 and 2018's Battlefield 5 as the most popular game from the series on Steam.

That's according to the XboxEra podcast and Windows Central, both of which believe Diablo 4's tentative "2023" release window can be narrowed down to April, with early access reportedly launching in February, and pre-orders going live as early as next month. 

It's thought more news will come during December's The Game Awards, which certainly sounds plausible enough. Thankfully, we won't have long to wait to test if the rumours are true; the Awards are set for 8th December which is just a few short weeks away now.

That's according to games journalist Imran Khan, who offered an insider peek at the sequel's lengthy delay on his Patreon, reflecting on why those open world rumours seemingly didn't amount to anything in the end. 

"At one point in development, Bayonetta 3 was scoped as a semi-open world game," Khan wrote on a public Patreon post. "The design was going to draw more off Astral Chain than Nier Automata, but the idea was that a large hub world would send Bayonetta (or whoever else) to different worlds which would themselves be fairly open. Maybe Super Mario 64 would be a good reference point for this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Geri "Ginger Spice" Halliwell-Horner and Djimon Hounsou have been cast in Sony's upcoming Gran Turismo movie.

The former is interesting not just because of her "rare narrative screen appearance", as The Hollywood Reporter puts it, but also because the Spice girl is married to team principal of Red Bull's Formula One team, Christian Horner.

Sony's live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Stranger Things' David Harbour was the first member of the cast to be officially revealed with the news he'll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who's helming the project.

Sharp-eyed fans first spotted the mysterious new Pokémon during a segment on Scarlet and Violet's photo mode, its round grey head and twin antenna barely visible behind a chunk of UI.


There've been no further sightings following that discovery, and developer GameFreak is yet to reveal more, but a new Pokémon Go update has now, albeit inadvertently, kicked the little fella into the spotlight sooner than intended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Capcom's stupendous 2011 paranormal puzzle adventure about posessing inanimate objects, might be making a comeback, with the South Korean ratings board having now listed it for release on PC.


Ghost Trick, for those unlucky enough to have never made its aquaintance, was created by Shu Takumi, best known as the designer of Capcom's much-loved Ace Attorney series. It follows the adventures of Sissel, who wakes at the beginning of the game in spirit form, inches from his corpse, with little recollection of his past. It soon transpires, though, that while Sissel has lost his memories, he's gained some new abilities - ghost tricks, you might say! - in their place. 


From that point on, progress is generally made by watching scenes play out - Ghost Trick has a wonderfully engaging story - then rewinding back to figure out a way of influencing events to change their outcome, usually by possessing different items around the evironment and then bringing them to life at the right moment.

The Pastel Pop Kit ushers in a selection of home furnishings and decorative additions - including mirrors, shelves, and desk items - with a focus on the "simple and psychedelic". That means "quirky pastel prints, irregular shapes, and vintage vibes" inspired by 60s and 70s design.


Next week's second DLC, the Everyday Clutter Kit, does pretty much exactly what it says in the title, introducing items that can be used to give homes a "loved and lived-in" look - ranging from coffee mugs to magazine stacks.

As with volume 1, which released last September, this second collection bundles together 10 gaming favourites from SNK's short-lived but much-loved Neo Geo Pocket.


Somewhat unhelpfully, SNK is yet to announce what those 10 games will be, but sharp-eyed readers with better SNK knowledge than me might find some clues in the accompanying announcement artwork below. Inevitably, there's no pricing details yet either, but expect it to be similar to volume 1, available on Steam and eShop for £29.99/£35.99 respectively.

Sadly that doesn't include the duo's latest PS5 adventure, which released in June 2021 and was considered something of a showpiece for the console.

Speaking to IGN, Yoshida was asked to comment on responses to the latest trailer that features mostly white characters.


Yoshida admitted it was a difficult question to answer, but that the lack of diversity fits the "isolated nature of this realm" - Valisthea, where the game takes place.

The two-and-a-half-minute footage shows an in-game scene with a character who looks a lot like Margaret Qualley - someone fans will recognise from her role as Mama in Kojima's previous game Death Stranding. 


The video looks as if it was originally designed for internal use, as it also features a feed of someone apparently playing the scene. All of this has then been videoed by someone else, off of a very reflective screen which shows the man taping the footage to be lying in bed half-naked. Lovely.

The past year has seen a flurry of mergers and acquisitions within the video game industry, with Microsoft following up its Bethesda purchase by launching its attempt to buy Activision Blizzard, while Sony has gobbled up Bungie and Take-Two has taken on Zynga.


Don't expect the Death Stranding developer to follow suit, however - even as Kojima looks to be building new games for both Microsoft and Sony.

Blue Box, the developer of Abandoned, gained internet fame for continually teasing that there was more to its survival horror game than met the eye. Fans pounced on the suggestion it was linked to Kojima, or was one of the many Silent Hill projects in production. Neither is the case.


"Users just kept sending me pictures of this Hasan [Kahraman, Abandoned's creator]. They still send me collages and deepfake images - like 20 a day. It's really quite a nuisance! [laughs] This has been going on for almost two years now," Kojima said, speaking in the latest episode of his Spotify podcast.

Frogwares revealed its plans for a "full remake and substantial rewrite" of The Awakened back in July, launching a Kickstarter campaign shortly after to secure additional funding to complete the game - a step the Ukranian studio said was necessary due to complications arising from Russia's ongoing invasion. 


Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, in its new guise, will rework the events of the original to serve as a continuation of the studio's young Sherlock arc, which began in last year's enjoyable Chapter One. As such, it'll follow a young Sherlock Holmes, along with his new acquaintance John Watson, on his first big case in London - an investigation soon leading to a Cthulhu-worshipping cult and other Lovecraft-inspired horrors.

Schachner returned for this year's Modern Warfare 2, but has now confirmed she won't be providing any further music for the title - or indeed Call of Duty: Warzone - as a result of seemingly insurmountable work concerns.

Mina the Hollower


Mina the Hollower is Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games' latest retro-inspired project, a challenging action-adventure RPG inspired by the Game Boy Colour. Landing somewhere between Link's Awakening and Bloodborne, it's "a bone chilling new adventure" starring a whip-wielding inventor mouse whose attacks are intentionally slow - meaning spacing and timing is crucial during combat. Mina also has a signature burrowing technique preventing her from being damaged when underground, and an upgrade system that requires collecting bones from defeated enemies to level up different skills. There's no release date for Mina the Hollower yet, but it's currently "deep in development".

        <updated>2022-11-03T20:50:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD has revealed its first RDNA 3 graphics cards, the $1000 Radeon RX 7900 XTX and $900 RX 7900 XT. As the numbering scheme and price points indicate, these are high-end models designed to compete with Nvidia's RTX 4090 and 4080, but they come with more substantial changes than you might expect - including FSR 3, designed to counter Nvidia's DLSS 3 frame generation, and a brand new chiplet-based design.


Before we get into the features though, let's take a look at the cards themselves. The chiplet design breaks a traditional monolithic GPU into several interconnected sections. For RDNA 3, that's a single 5nm graphics compute die (GCD) that's 300mm² and six 6nm memory cache dies (MCDs) that are each 37mm². This design means that only the most critical areas need to be made with a cutting-edge 5nm process, helping to improve CPU yields, reducing costs and ultimately consumer prices. However, it also requires a fast interconnect between the different chips - which runs at 5.3TB/s here. This same chiplet approach worked brilliantly with Ryzen, transforming AMD from an also-run to a growing giant, so it'll be fascinating to see how it if works miracles in the GPU space too.


Each of the dies are impressive in their own right. The memory cache die uses a 64-bit memory controller and a second-gen Infinity Cache, which combine to provide 2.7 times the peak bandwidth of RDNA2 designs. Meanwhile, the graphics compute die offers unified RDNA 3 compute units with hardware for stream processing, AI acceleration and RT. The design also decouples shader and front end clocks speed, with 2.3GHz for the former and 2.5GHz for the latter, which AMD says will result in a more efficient design - with up to 25 percent power savings in terms of shaders and 15 percent higher front-end clock frequency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to Sony's eye-opening announcement of its PlayStation VR2 pricing, alongside Eurogamer's resident VR superfan and advocate Ian Higton as a special guest.

The PSVR2 is a high-end device and it was never going to be cheap, but its £530 cost (£570 if you actually also want something to play) has placed it out of reach for many console players  - let alone those without a PS5 already. Of the many headset options available, Sony's was expected to be the most likely to attract a wider audience and grow the budding VR scene. But with that price, and a line-up of games you can mostly play elsewhere, why not choose another option - if you are interested in VR at all? 
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Ishraq Subhan join Ian and me as we discuss why the headset costs so much, what Sony could do to sweeten the deal, and what future we think PSVR2 now has at that price point.

Filling up attachment slots was common advice for previous Call of Duty games, since the drawbacks were negligible compared to the benefits. 


But the community now thinks filling up all five attachment slots in MW2 may not be optimal, with drawbacks for many attachments not outweighing the benefits.

We were originally expecting Blood Bowl 3 back in August 2021, though its claret-filled casualties failed to turn up on time. Nacon belatedly confirmed it had delayed the project, blaming production delays due to the pandemic.


A further delay last year saw Blood Bowl 3 pushed to a late 2022 launch. Here's hoping today's final revision to February 2023 is the one that now sticks.

Characters from the game will be able to collect as digital art. There's also an interactive story where players can "untangle a mystery by completing missions". There's no explanation of why this incorporates NFTs at all.

Current weapons available to download are the M4 assault rifle and Signal 50 sniper rifle, with plans to add more down the line.

Last month, Blizzard's Albany-based band of Diablo testers formally  won the right to form a union following a months-long process. Ballots were subsequently sent out, with the result due to be announced on 18th November. 


Now, Activision Blizzard has entered a motion to impound those ballots, GamesIndustry.biz reports. The company's top brass is currently appealing the Diablo testers' ability to unionise, and claims any announcement of the results would prejudice future results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has finally got around to sharing more concrete information on Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope's season pass, which has been available to purchase for some time now, breaking down the three content drops owners will receive throughout 2023.


First up is The Tower of Doooom, planned for launch in "early 2023". This sees Madame Bwahstrella enlisting Mario, Rabbid Peach, and pals to help save her friend Spawny - a task that'll require players to battle their way to the top of the titular tower in what Ubisoft is calling a "highly strategic" new combat game mode.


The Tower of Doooom will be followed by a currently unnamed second DLC instalment in "mid 2023", taking players to an "enchanting" new planet. Here, they'll be able to "explore new environments, meet fun characters, discover secrets, and face off against new enemies."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced a last-minute delay for the PlayStation 5 version of Football Manager 2023, citing "unforeseen complications which have arisen during the submissions and approvals process."


Football Manager 2023 was to mark the series long-awaited debut on PlayStation 5, with Sport Interactive boss Miles Jacobson having previously blamed its absence on Sony's unwillingness to send dev kits to the studio. "To make games for a platform, you need a dev kit," he explained in 2020. "To get a dev kit, the platform holder has to want the game on the platform. We spoke with Sony, we have no dev kits. We spoke with Microsoft, they sent them to us."


Football fans with PS5s finally got the news they'd hoping for earlier this year, when Sports Interactive revealed Football Manager 2023 would be heading to Sony's platform on 8th November. Now, however, the studio has been forced to announce an indefinite delay for the title due to "unforeseen complications" relating to Sony's submissions and approvals process.

Writing in a now-deleted post on reddit  (thanks, PC Gamer), the first-person shooter fan stated they had been stopped by a security guard after entering the car park of the company's office in Austin, Texas on Monday, 31st October. 


The fan says they "politely" asked to be let into the office to complain about their "wrongful" Modern Warfare 2 ban, having spent $140 on a special edition version of the game. The fan was refused entry, and told to wait for customer support to resolve the issue.

Frontier has paid £8.3m upfront, with a further £3.3m due over the next year if milestones are met.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor looks set to launch by the end of March 2023 - even though publisher EA is yet to make it official.


Speaking to investors in a financial briefing last night, EA said it had a "major IP" due to arrive before 31st March next year - but that it was holding off on its big reveal until nearer the time.


The sequel to 2019's popular Jedi: Fallen Order is really the only thing on EA's slate this "major IP" without a release date could be. We already know the launch dates of EA's upcoming Need for Speed return, its Dead Space remake and its collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Wild Hearts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is ramping up the hype for its upcoming Norse epic God of War Ragnarök with some pretty eclectic marketing. 


Yesterday, we got to see Ben Stiller leading a group therapy session with John Travolta, LeBron James and their children, and today we get to witness Japan's newest Ragnarök trailer.


This trailer is an upbeat little number complete with its own (quite catchy) song and dance routine. The parent in me likens it to Australian children's music group The Wiggles, but with weapons added in to give it that bit extra. It is quite something, and I sort of love it. See it for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Deus Ex title is reportedly in the works at Embracer Group's recently acquired Eidos-Montréal studio, albeit one that's still in the "very very early" stages of development.


That's according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who made the claim in a tweet accompanying today's news of Square Enix Montréal's closure.


Although no further details on the new Deus Ex project were shared, this would seemingly be the first known instance of a major Square Enix IP being revived under Embracer Group's watch since it acquired the likes of Tomb Raider, Thief, and Deus Ex - plus Square Enix Montréal, Eidos-Montréal, and Crystal Dynamics - as part of a $300m deal in May.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group is closing its down Square Enix Montréal studio - which it purchased as part of a $300m USD deal with Square Enix back in May - just weeks after rebranding it Studio Onoma.


In its Square Enix Montréal guise, Onama was a predominantly mobile-focused developer, perhaps best known for its Go series of puzzles games. It was working on Tomb Raider Reloaded, Avatar Generations, and a new Space Invaders game when it was acquired by Embracer Group alongside Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal in May.


As reported by Bloomberg, however, Embracer Group today informed staff it will be closing the studio in a move the company says will affect around 200 employees. Bloomberg's sources claim some members of the Onama team will be transferred to Eidos-Montréal, although it's unclear how many employees will be left without jobs following today's news.

From today, 1st November, until Sunday, 6th November, players can find four Doctor-Who-themed costume sets in Fall Guys' premium item shop, costing 800 Show-Bucks apiece.


There's one inspired by Tom Baker's legendary fourth Doctor, one based on Jodie Whittaker's incarnation, and a third modelled after the latest David Tennant regeneration - which the BBC is officially referring to as the Fourteenth Doctor - as seen at the end of showrunner Chris Chibnall's recent swansong The Power of the Doctor.

Apparently, the father and son relationship we see in God of War between Kratos and Atreus is key to these famous faces nurturing their own parent-child bonds.


The resulting trailer is described as "a Super Bowl-level spot", which you can see below.

Fixing the bug involved Pokémon Go developer Niantic briefly disabling the game's Bluetooth device support - used by auto-catching accessories such as the officially-licensed Go Plus device and unofficial Gotcha wristband.


Support for these gadgets was re-enabled this morning when the bug was fixed, following a weekend of fan fury directed at Danger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got word there was a Monkey Island-like game in the works. This in itself is not exactly unusual - point and click games have always been around, even if they are not as prevalent as they once were. 


But this Monkey Island-like game has something else going for it that made my ears prick up. Not only is it described as a "merry and macabre point and click adventure game" by its developers, but it also happens to have Jonathan Ackley (Curse of Monkey Island's co-director) giving it his seal of approval. Colour me interested!


The game in question is Foolish Mortals, and it comes from the minds at Inklingwood Studios - you can see a teaser for it below. Heavily inspired by the Monkey Island series, this game takes place in an exotic locale and, as luck would have it, there is a demo for it available right now on Steam. So, of course, I headed on over to give this upcoming release a whirl.

The game's ever-popular Lightsaber weapons are back, as is the return of Darth Vader and various Stormtroopers to defeat. In a nice touch, the Junk Rift item (which plummets an object onto a specific location, squashing anyone below it) can now drop Luke's landspeeder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's ongoing grasp for a chunk of the video game pie continues with the streaming service's announcement it has now snapped up Spry Fox, the studio behind the likes of Triple Town, Alphabear, and last year's Cozy Grove.


Netflix shared the news - which comes just shy of a year since the streaming service took its first tentative steps into gaming - on its website, saying Spry Fox's focus on "cosy, original" games would help it "accelerate our creative development in another beloved genre and add to the growing variety of Netflix's games catalogue that will have something for everyone."


It's unclear what today's news means for Spry Fox's previously announced publishing partnership with Epic Games, which was intended to result in a "multiplatform nonviolent persistent" MMO "designed to encourage friendship and reduce loneliness in the world".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playground Games' long-awaited Fable reboot continues to staff up with the news that Andrew Walsh, whose credits include senior writer on Horizon Forbidden West and associate narrative director on Horizon Call of the Mountain, has joined the team.


Walsh - whose writing career has spanned everything form The Division 2 and Prince of Persia to UK TV shows Emmerdale and Byker Grove - revealed his new role on Twitter, writing, "So, Albion has beckoned once again. I'm delighted to announce that I've had the chance to join the wonderful team [at Playground] working on the new Fable!".


As his tweet implies, this won't be Walsh's first dalliance with the Fable series; he was also lead writer on Fable Legends, the ill-fated free-to-play multiplayer-based spin-off, which was cancelled in 2016 when Microsoft made the decision to close developer Lionhead Studios.

Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord, a collaboration between Sony Pictures Virtual Reality and developer nDreams, promises to unleash an "extensive and engrossing" spirit-bothering adventure playable either solo or co-operatively with up to three friends. 


It also waves goodbye to the series' traditional home of New York City and makes the jump to San Franciso, taking players on a tour of some familiar sights - including the Golden Gate Bridge - as they attempt to thwart the titular Ghost Lord and his army of malevolent spirits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portal 2's director Josh Weier has spoken more about the game's cut content and given background information on why features were cut or how they came to be.

The team that worked on Valve's first-person puzzle adventure masterpiece have openly talked about cut content in the past. At the Games Developer Conference in 2012, writers Erik Wolpaw and Chet Faliszek talked about features that were cut such as Garfield references, multiple endings, and Wheatley's early demise. Later that year at PAX Prime, Wolpaw also revealed Valve had planned to have protagonist Chell marry a turret during the game.

10 years on, speaking to Did You Know Gaming, Josh Weier has weighed in with his own insight on why these bits were cut and where they stemmed from during development.

One such modder is Raq (whose name you may recognise from our Tomb Raider Anniversary piece). They have created the Elena mod for Legacy of Thieves which, as I am sure you have guessed already, puts Elena into the spotlight by reskinning series hero Nathan Drake as his wife.
I am a big fan of the Uncharted series as a whole, and of Elena Fisher especially (you may be able to spot a poster of her on my wall during Newscasts). With this mod being a particularly notable one for me, I contacted Raq to find out more about why they siezed the chance to bring Elena to the fore.

Over the weekend, God of War creative director Cory Barlog said it was "completely fucking stupid" fans have to "dodge the spoilers" after retailers began selling Ragnarök  copies well ahead of the game's official launch on Wednesday 9th November - still more than a week away. 


Now, Sony Santa Monica has offered its own less-sweary official comment, asking fans to be considerate of others, and advising those who wish to remain unspoiled to "mute any keywords or hashtags associated with the game until release day" when browsing social media.

But in an interview with Shacknews (spotted by TheGamer), Iizuka has clarified that Sonic Team's game is more linear and - for the millionth time - open zone, not open world.

The Store is Closed - which we told you about a couple of weeks ago - is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games' The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy. 

Whilst it doesn't use any of Ikea's products, names, or branding, Ikea believes the developer is infringing on its copyright and has sent in New York legal firm Fross Zelnick. Consequently, Ziggy - who's based in the UK - has ten days to make the changes or face legal action.

The news comes via a now-deleted video that reportedly popped up on Chinese studio Virtuos' YouTube channel earlier today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another day, another Steam concurrent user record broken. This time, it comes just days after Steam hit 30m concurrent players and sees Valve's PC gaming client clock up a giant 30,049,264 simultaneous players.

That said, whilst that figure comes from SteamDB, Steam itself states the all-time peak is a more modest 30,044,046. In either case, though, it's proof that PC gaming remains on the rise, even if the majority of those players were idling at the time (SteamDB estimates "just" 8.9 million were actively in-game at the time the record was set).

Steam numbers have been rising since the pandemic began in 2020, with a previous previous peak of just under 30 million set back in March this year.

We also get to see "the variety of spells at her disposal giving players a taste of what to expect when the game launches". You can check it out below:

The next video - slated to drop on 3rd November - will focus more on Forspoken's combat "and dive into the fundamentals of Frey's magical combat skills" by sharing more about the types of magic, attacks, and upgrades we'll be able to unlock. The final video, out 10th November, showcases the quests, challenges and activities players will "find and accomplish" in the world of Athia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega's biggest franchise, Sonic the Hedgehog, has topped 1.5 billion sales.

As spotted by our sister site, GamesIndustry.biz, the Japanese megacorp confirmed in its most recent financial report that that figure includes all premium sales and free-to-play downloads since the franchise was born in 1991.

Interestingly, Sega Sammy Holdings also revealed sales of its other key franchises, too. In 22 years, Total War has amassed an impressive 40.4 million units sold, Football Manager and Chain Chronicles have each sold 25 million copies, whilst the fan-favourite Persona series has sold 15.5 million units since 1996, with Persona 5 alone selling 7.22 million copies globally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncharted and The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog is working with a number of other PlayStation Studios teams to develop a mysterious new project in a "beloved franchise".


That's according to a newly spotted Sony job listing (thanks VGC) seeking a game design intern to work at a "new PlayStation studio based in San Diego... co-developing an exciting new project with Naughty Dog in a beloved franchise." There's no additional information about the new studio, but it seems highly likely it's the same San-Diego-based "new internal game develop team" Sony referenced in a different job listing earlier this week.


That earlier job advert initially revealed the new team was being built to collaborate on a new "high visibility" project with Naughty Dog and Visual Arts - Sony's San-Diego-based support studio that most recently worked with Naughty Dog on its The Last of Us: Part 1 remake. However, a later edit removed the explicit reference to Visual Arts, for reasons unknown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe's ambitious The Duviri Paradox expansion has been delayed into 2023 - but there're still a couple of treats heading to the free-to-play sci-fi shooter before the end of the year, including a mini prequel going by the name of Lua's Prey.


The Duviri Paradox is Warframe's latest open-world expansion - following the likes of Plains of Eidolon and Heart of Deimos - and plunges players into the extremely weird world of Duviri, a fantasy-western-themed kingdom existing inside the mind of new big bad Dominus Thrax. More striking, though - and there's a lot of eye-catching stuff, from its stark black and white aesthetic to its skeletal horse steed - is its new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees developer Digital Extremes "flirting with rogue-like elements".


It's intriguing stuff then, but while The Duviri Paradox was initially due to launch some time in "winter 2022", Digital Extremes has now confirmed it's pushing the expansion's release back into 2023. The studio didn't offer much on the reason behind the delay, only saying it was "to deliver the best experience possible."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firaxis' Marvel-themed strategy game Midnight Suns will be adding the likes of Venom, Morbius, and Storm as paid DLC starting in early 2023.


Marvel's Midnight Suns, if you're unfamiliar, draws inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s to deliver a superhero strategy game blending turn-based combat, card-battling, and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building. At launch on 2nd December, it'll include 12 playable heroes, ranging from the immediately familiar - think the Avengers and X-Men - to perhaps lesser-known characters from the likes of the Runaways.


However, publisher 2K has now confirmed Midnight Suns' roster will begin to expand in early 2023, when Deadpool joins the line-up as premium DLC. Deadpool arrives in the first of four planned DLC packs - all included in a season pass or available to purchase individually - with each one adding a new hero (plus their respective abilities), new story missions, upgrades for the Abbey, plus new skins and outfits.

The map, initially called Marina Bay Grand Prix, was announced back in August during the Call of Duty (eSports) League Championship Weekend and was seemingly inspired by the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore.


But in September, any mention of the map was purged from all of Call of Duty and Infinity Ward's social media accounts, as well as any trailers on its YouTube channel. The map was also missing during the multiplayer open beta.

This was then delayed from September to the "first half of October", but fans criticised the inability to pre-order in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontier has announced it is ending post-launch support for its inaugural F1 Manager sim less than two months after release, saying its next patch will be the game's last major update as it moves staff elsewhere to "ensure upcoming F1 Manager projects realise their potential".


F1 Manager 2022, which launched at the end of August, is the first of four games planned for release under Frontier's new F1 licensing deal. It put players in the role of a team principal, challenging them to lead their "drivers, engineers and fans to glory in the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Drivers' World Championship and FIA Formula 1 Constructors' World Championship".


While F1 Manager 2022 received a decent critical reception at launch, it's drawn criticism among players for shallow, undercooked features and a significant number of bugs. Many had hoped at least some of these issues would be properly addressed through robust post-launch support, but Frontier has now called time on further development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10 years after its introduction, Steam's Big Picture mode has received a long overdue overhaul, with Valve finally making good on last year's promise to replace the ageing UI with its decidedly more modern Steam Deck interface - albeit initially only for testing prior to a general release.


Steam's Big Picture mode first surfaced back in 2012, introducing an optional new UI for Valve's storefront specifically designed for use with televisions and controllers. It's changed in barely noticeable increments since then, lagging far behind Valve's recent major overhaul for Steam's desktop mode, but as of today, it's out with the old and in with the new. 


Just as it promised last July, Valve has now replaced the old Big Picture mode with the far more modern UI created for its handheld gaming PC, Steam Deck. "This controller-first interface was designed for Steam Deck in handheld and docked mode," Valve explains, "and is perfect for all the scenarios Big Picture mode currently handles."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's all looking a bit Sonic the Hedgehog as the year nears its end; not only does the blue streak make his video game return next month in Sonic Frontiers, Netflix has confirmed its 3D animated series Sonic Prime is hitting the streaming service on Thursday, 15th December.


Sonic Prime was announced last February, after a bit of a premature reveal toward the end of 2020, with Netflix promising a 24-episode series that would send Sonic on a "journey of self-discovery and redemption" in which the "fate of a strange new multiverse" was in his hands.


Since then, we've had teases, plus a slightly more revealing 40-second trailer, confirming appearance from Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Big the Cat - who appears to be having something of a renaissance this year, seeing as he's also been sighted in Sonic Frontiers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five years after developer Jumpship formally unveiled its side-scrolling sci-fi apocalypse adventure Somerville, a release is in sight, with the studio having somewhat unexpectedly announced a 15th November launch on Xbox One and PC earlier today.


Jumpship is an independent studio founded by film animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Dino Patti, co-founder and former CEO of Limbo studio Playdead. And while Somerville's formal reveal came in 2017, Olsen - who has worked the likes of Skyfall and The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron - had already been tinkering away on the project for three years before that.


Somerville - described as a "hand-crafted narrative experience set across a vivid rural landscape" that sees players navigating perilous terrain "to unravel the mysteries of Earth's visitors" - has continued to look wonderfully intriguing since its big reveal. However, it's been nearly a year since its most recent public showing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern Warfare 2's full release is just around the corner, and ahead of this developer Infinity Ward is keen to clear some things up - notably that, despite some similarities in missions, the game is not running a "commentary" on the world's current events.


"It's an entertainment adventure," Call of Duty narrative director Brian Bloom explained recently (via PCGamesN). "And as far as real people and real places doing real things, you know, these are not based on actual events."


Bloom went on to state the team is, however, inspired by real-world events. "We want you to feel like when you play the game, it's happening in the world that you live in, and our heroes are here to do things that put the world back the way it was, in the way we left it, to restore it," he continued.

Speaking at a recent press briefing, Respawn explained the starting point for Catalyst's aesthetic was "techno witch", with her final design aiming to represent both stylishness - in her emo goth vibes - and technological practicality. She is, after all, a member of a terraforming crew hired to help restore the moon of Cleo - which, as Season 15 begins, has been turned in an Apex Games arena, something Catalyst won't stand for.


Described as an "elegant and standoffish woman who likes crystals more than she likes people", Catalyst is Apex Legends' first trans character - voiced by trans actor Meli Grant - and, as Respawn succinctly puts it, simply reflects the fact the "real world is a diverse place".

The "New Zealand" trick, which lets players trick their consoles into letting them access a game that doesn't release until midnight in their own region, has been a staple of game releases for many years. 


But Infinity Ward has issued a statement warning players may experience "connectivity issues" and "may be locked out of the game" until the game is officially released in their region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinity Ward has shared a list of changes to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer ahead of tomorrow's release. The changes were made in response to feedback from the beta.


The biggest change is the addition of diamond icons above enemy heads to increase visibility. 


In the beta, there was no indicator to differentiate between friendly and enemy players. This was traditionally achieved through name tags in previous games, but Infinity Ward took the design decision to remove them, seemingly to add to realism. Players didn't take kindly to the change and called for the return of name tags. Diamond icons are therefore a compromise between good enemy visibility and realism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Striking Distance and publisher Krafton have announced the Japanese version of upcoming space-horror The Callisto Protocol has been cancelled. 


This is due to the game's violent content, which means it was unable to secure an age rating with the CERO (Japan's equivalent of PEGI in Europe and the ESRB in North America). 


The developer has stated those who pre-ordered this version of the game will receive a full refund for their purchase.

"Now, for the first time, we can experience the entire game, from the opening scenes of the first mission to the very end," it continued. "We can see, hear, feel, and play everything as a cohesive experience."

        <updated>2022-10-26T20:37:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's head of gaming Phil Spencer has discussed possible price increases across the Xbox line, acknowledging that while the company has so far maintained prices for its consoles, Game Pass, and games, it will "at some point...have to raise the price on certain things".


Speaking at the Wall Street Journal's Tech Live (thanks The Verge), Spencer admitted, "We've held price on our console, we've held price on games and our subscription. I don't think we'll be able to do that forever... I do think at some point we'll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices."


Earlier this year, of course, Sony announced it would be increasing the cost of PlayStation 5 in response to "high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends". At the time, Spencer said Xbox would not be following suit, explaining, "When our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don't think it's the right move." Given Spencer's latest comments, though, it's unclear how long that might last.
