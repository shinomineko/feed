        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Nightmares 3 might still be some way off - it's due to arrive in 2024 - but, in the spirit of this spookiest of seasons, Bandai Namco has shared 18 minutes of co-op gameplay.


Announced back in August, Little Nightmares 3 marks the first time a mainline entry in the series won't be handled by original developer Tarsier Studios. Instead, Supermassive Games - the team behind The Dark Pictures Anthology and Until Dawn - is at the helm, taking players on an adventure following two new protagonists.


Our spooky new pals are Low and Alone, both trapped in a world known as the Spiral - a "cluster of disturbing places" that includes the sandy Necropolis, home to a monolithic (and far from friendly) creature known as Monster Baby. An extensive look at the Necropolis and its perils can be found in the new gameplay trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Five Nights at Freddy's movie adaptation from Universal and Blumhouse has seen some impressive numbers following its release, breaking several records in the process.


The live-action adaptation of Scott Cawthon's video game series, which stars The Hunger Games' Josh Hutcherson as troubled security Mike Schmidt, made its box office debut last week and has earned $78m in North America and $130m globally since then. 


As noted by Variety, this makes the movie the second-largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation in the US, coming only behind that of Nintendo and Illumination's animated Super Mario Bros. Movie, which made $146.3 million.

This filing was made in November of last year, but was made public earlier this month. As shared on World Intellectual Property Organisation (via ResetEra), images of this device show a handheld apparatus, not too dissimilar to that of a Nintendo 3DS. Unlike the 3DS, however, this device can be split in half to allow for wireless gaming between two players.


It appears to be a handheld machine only, with no hybrid capabilities. Additionally, the top screen can face out. This is even when the device is closed. I can only assume if this product was to ever be realised, Nintendo would advise we all get some kind of case to go with it to protect the screens

In an interview with PC Gamer, the Counter-Strike 2 dev team – seemingly responding as a team and not as individual developers – said that whilst it had worked hard to ensure CS:GO players could transfer their skins and cosmetics into CS2, it "didn't know enough" about NFTs to contribute meaningfully to the web3 debate and claims that players could transfer their NFT cosmetics in the same way.

"From the start of development, we knew that CS2 would ultimately replace CS:GO, and we wanted to ensure that players could keep as many of their CS:GO skills and items as possible," the CS2 dev team said. "So, early into the process, we started the work to support all of the CS:GO weapons, stickers, agents, and music in CS2.

In an interview with GQ magazine, Lake admitted that whilst the development of cult horror game Alan Wake was difficult in the shadows of Max Payne – "the curse of the second album", as Lake describes it – there are still other worlds outside of Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Control he would like to entertain us with. 

"Would I ever do anything else?" he asks. "Yeah. I'm still thinking that I will. There will be a time when I retire. It's just that… this has all been so engaging."

The comments come after Wizards of the Coast recently revealed what new crossover expansions Magic: The Gathering fans can expect to see next year, including new sets based upon Final Fantasy, Fallout, and the Assassin's Creed series.

Back in 2018, Rosewater was asked if WotC would ever "consider licensing a different IP and creating different cards for it". In response, he said that the team thought it was "important that Magic is one cohesive game and not a hodge podge of different things".

That's according to an interview Beaver gave with the CaptainBribo podcast, in which he said that while he would "keep the lore beat it's predicated on", and "keep the lore you find out", he would "have Ellie there but in a different relationship [with Isaac] and redo the entire main story".

As transcribed by PCGN, Beaver talks with Bribo about how, if able to rewrite the third instalment of the terrifying sci-fi horror series, he would ensure the story focussed more tightly on protagonist Isaac Clarke, albeit retaining the co-op mechanic to illustrate how the two characters see the same things differently.

That's according to u/Tobbelobben30, who and noted that the name Tobias Kleanthous was "mentioned in the [GTA 6] leaks". After a little sleuthing, Tobbelobben discovered that Kleanthous worked at Rockstar between 2014 and late 2021, during which he specialised in AI/gameplay and animation. 

Interestingly, Kleanthous is also the lead inventor and author of a patent called System and Method for Virtual Character Locomotion, which they describe on their LinkedIn profile as "regarding animated locomotion control based on some of the core technology" they "architected and implemented at Rockstar Games".

People more familiar with cars than I am are speculating that the seven cars coming in this "big update" are:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eagle-eyed fans reckon they've spotted evidence that "some sort of" Dragon Quest announcement could be on the way.

Square Enix producer and director, Yosuke Saito, took to Twitter/X yesterday to say they'd had a "fun recording session" at work, teasing that they'd tell us more once the news had been finalised and approved by the appropriate channels.

So far, so what, right? Well, the tweet was accompanied by a photo of Saito's script, and whilst they'd obscured two blocks of text on the front page to hide the subject matter, a little of the text behind the front page was legible for those who can read Japanese… and it's a name hidden in plain sight that has made Dragon Quest fans very, very excited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 players have hit back at a new Halloween-themed DLC fatality that has a horrifying price tag: $10.

Players can pick up the gruesome jack-o-lantern animation for the princely sum of 1200 Dragon Krystals, a premium in-game currency that sports a current exchange rate of 1250 krystals for $10 USD.

To put that into context, Mortal Kombat 11's Kombat Pack, whilst the preceding title in the series, featured several full DLC characters for just $20. But Mortal Kombat 1 wants the equivalent of $10 for that one fatality, even though it's a premium game that costs at best £60 – or £85 if you forked out for the premium edition.

Although the developer/publisher has yet to even announce what the game is, according to Capcom's recent investor's report, a "major title" will be available on console and be released in the second half of this financial year – which ends in March 2024, of course.

As posted to Reddit's Gaming Leaks and Rumours community, the report – which is currently only available in Japanese – makes two mentions of the mysterious title, including one that intimates that its release will help the megacorp realise its lofty goal of selling 45 million units on console.

The Outlast Trials is out now in early access on both Steam and Epic Games Store. Set in the height of the Cold War era, players take on the role of test subjects abducted by the shady Murkoff Corporation, where they'll be "thrust into a series of physical and mental ordeals, tormented by iconic characters, and challenged alone or in teams to survive with their sanity intact".

The episode, called "South Park: Joining the Panderverse", sees Cartman live in an alternate reality wherein he curses the fact he can't cross-save the 50 hours he's invested into Baldur's Gate 3 across multiple universes.

Cartman – played by Janeisha Adams-Ginyard, just to sprinkle in a little extra confusion – asks, "do save games not cross multiple universes?", to which Stan confirms: "Save games don't even cross between PCs and PS5s – why would they cross between multiple universes?"

This year's BlizzCon, which is being held at California's Anaheim Convention Center, runs from Saturday, 3rd November to Sunday, 4th November; all panels due to take place at the BlizzCon Arena during that time will be streamed in their entirety via YouTube and Twitch for the benefit of fans unable to attend in-person.


In total, 11 panels will be broadcast over the course of the two-day event, with the most tantalising - aside from BlizzCon's Opening Ceremony, which usually manages to pack in reveal or two (not always a good one, admittedly) - being the four offering a look at "what's next".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free-to-play battle royale shooter Apex Legends is finally introducing cross-progression as part of its 19th season, and ahead of its arrival next Tuesday, 31st October, developer Respawn Entertainment has detailed how the whole thing'll work.


Cross-progression, once launched, will enable players to access their progression data, cosmetics, and currency via a single EA account across all platforms. Crucially, the cross-progression migration process is both automatic and mandatory, meaning there's a fair amount those who play across multiple platforms will likely want to know in preparation.


For starters, players who've accrued different progress levels across multiple platforms will soon have all that smushed together into a single account. Respawn will generate the stats of this new account based on what it's calling a player's "primarily platform" - that is, the one with the highest level reached across all platforms. Stats/progress of all other accounts will be lost.

The hardest labor generally happens at night, from 5 P.M. until 7 A.M. Hundreds of bowling-ball-size light bulbs hang on racks on both sides of the vessel, enticing the squid up from the depths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arizona Sunshine 2, the sequel to developer Vertigo Games' well-received 2016 VR zombie shooter, is coming to PlayStation VR 2, Meta Quest, and Steam VR on 7th December - and there's a new gameplay trailer to accompany the news.


Vertigo's sequel brings back the original game's wise-cracking protagonist for another bout of sun-kissed (and optionally co-operative) zombie-slaying shooting action in the Arizona desert. This time, however, it's promising to mix things up with the likes of enhanced "next-gen VR environments" and a "new mutilation and gore system". And if you can't make zombies' eyes pop out by kicking them up the arse, I'm sending it back.


There's also talk of "all-new and fan-favourite" weapons - including the likes of shotguns, flamethrowers, crowbars, pickaxes, and machetes - but the absolute most critical new addition is Buddy. Yes, this time around, you get to mow down the zombies hordes alongside your own pet dog pal. And he's not just there for the violence; described as the "goodest boy to play a game of undead fetch with", he'll also unearth key items and help carry gear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities: Skylines 2 has got off to a bit of a rough, with many players complaining of performance issues following this week's launch on PC. But while publisher Paradox has been forthright in acknowledging these problems (even prior to launch, somewhat unconventionally), it now wants to make it absolutely clear that, no, technical issues aren't because the game is trying to render the teeth of every single person in your city.


All this apparently started with a post on the Cities: Skylines subreddit in which one Hexcoder0 claimed the game was rendering individual teeth with no LOD (level of detail) adjustments, even when viewed from far away. They even threw together a bit of a collage feature a screenshot, a couple of character meshes, and, vitally, two red circles, to illustrate their claim.

 
Two days later, Paradox - presumably in some kind of damage limitation frenzy given the not exactly glittering reception the game has received - has responded by firing a statement out to press drawing attention to the "bizarre story" and denying Molargate is true.

Developer Gameloft revealed today that its game would leave early access on 5th December but retain its early access price point (and indeed, it will also get pricier physical and special digital editions with extra currency and cosmetics bundled in).


On top of that, there's word of a major new expansion to the game, which will also come with a $30 price tag. Disney Dreamlight Valley: A Rift In Time will introduce new biomes and yet more characters to the base game, and is set to be fully detailed in a video showcase to be broadcast next Wednesday, 1st November at 5pm UK time.

PlayStation's rosy outlook is also boosted by the release of Marvel's Spider-Man 2, PlayStation exec Eric Lempel told Barron's (via ResetEra).
Lempel said Sony had been hampered by supply chain issues caused by the Covid pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which in turn caused a components shortage for PS5 production.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So you thought developer Rocksteady was done with Batman: Arkham Knight, did you? Well, it seems that might not be quite the case. Eight years after its initial release, Rocksteady's third entry in the Arkham series has been updated to add an unexpected bit of new content - but it appears the celebrations might have been a bit premature.


Earlier today, Batman fans began reporting the Epic Games Store version of 2015's Batman: Arkham Knight had received an update specifically adding Robert Pattinson's Batsuit, from last year's movie reboot, as a wearable skin.


It was a bit of an odd discovery for all sorts of reasons, not least because neither Rocksteady nor publisher Warner Bros. announced or acknowledged its arrival. The Pattsuit's apparent Epic Games Store exclusivity also seemed like a bit of a strange choice too, and the mystery only deepened when the suit reportedly vanished not long after word of its release began to spread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has officially released its long-awaited SteamVR 2.0 update, which - among other things - overhauls the Steam store experience in VR as part of an "ongoing effort to better unify the Steam ecosystem for all users, providing a more consistent experience across devices".


SteamVR 2.0 was confirmed to be in the works all the way back in 2019, but it wasn't until its surprise re-emergence last month that it started finding its way into users' hands - initially as part of a short beta designed to iron out any major wrinkles ahead of a general release.


And that official launch has now arrived, with the update bringing the likes of an overhauled VR storefront that'll make new and popular VR games easier to find, alongside the majority of features introduced as part of Steam's Steam-Deck-inspired Big Picture redesign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has started rolling out October's Xbox system update to all users, with this latest release introducing the previously announced ability to remap keyboard keys to Xbox controller buttons, alongside a number of other features.


Microsoft confirmed the new accessibility feature was undergoing Insider testing earlier this month, explaining its introduction would enable users to remap almost 90 keyboard keys - or combinations of keys - to any button on the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2. This would, for instance, make it possible for players with limited mobility to use the Xbox Adaptive Controller with games ordinarily only supporting mouse/keyboard.


Keyboard mapping for Xbox controllers will be available through the Xbox Accessories app on PC and console once October's update has been installed.

        <updated>2023-10-26T16:46:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its latest earnings report - for the first half of its fiscal year 2023-24 - Ubisoft has announced yet another delay for Skull and Bones, with the beleaguered pirate adventure now expected to arrive sometime in the first few months of 2024.


Skull and Bones has been in development since 2013, but the game has seen repeated delays following its official unveiling in 2017. Most recently, Ubisoft shifted the game's release from this March to an unspecified "early" point in its fiscal year 2023-24 in order to create a "much more polished and balanced experience and to build awareness".


Skull and Bones has received a closed beta since then, but word on a revised release date has remained conspicuously absent - and Ubisoft has now announced a delay into Q4 of its current financial year, meaning it's expected to arrive sometime within the January-March 2024 period. No reason was provided for this latest delay.

Tomorrow's Alan Wake 2 got a final airing and it looks just as creepy as we'd have hoped. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth has an Animal Crossing mode, and Liv in particular is delighted. Oh and Still Wakes The Deep - the spooky game from Everybody's Gone To The Rapture set on a Scottish oil rig, looks great. 
Opinion is a little more mixed on Metal Gear Solid Green Triangle: Snake Eater, with the visual style critiqued by some quarters of the internet today. Joining me to discuss the rest are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends: Ignite, the 19th season of the ever-popular battle royale, will explode onto our screens with the brand new Legend Conduit next Tuesday, 31st October. The massive in-game storm at Storm Point has now cleared the map and things look a little different to how we remember it, meaning there's plenty of new areas to explore as you fight to survive.
First off, let's talk about brand new Legend Conduit. We now know more about her abilities, as well as how she came to get her equipment and suit. Conduit began as a fan of Apex Legends and is now stoked to be part of the Apex Games themselves - but she didn't join just for fame or fun, as she's got a family to take care of. She's described as having a good sense of humour and being fascinated with the tech used in the games.
An interesting fact for any Titanfall fans is that Conduit uses a radioactive battery from a modified Monarch Titan to power her suit and gadgets. She went exploring on a highly-radiated battlefield and came across the battery. She then stole it and uses it to take her place in the Apex Games - but at a cost. The battery itself is poisoning Conduit, and though we're not sure how this will impact her story as we move ahead, we're a bit worried about her long-term chances.

The report comes from MobileGamer.Biz, with anonymous sources from inside Unity providing fresh details.

The new difficulty is named Nightmare, which I can only imagine will be incredibly challenging. When I got to play some of Alan Wake 2 earlier this year I explored two chapters on Normal mode and I died a lot. And then I died again.


On the plus side, players will still have all their previously unlocked weapons and upgrades to hand when they return to the game, as this is all retained in Alan Wake 2's New Game Plus.

The remake - Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater to use its official name - is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and this new trailer showed Snake sneaking around a beautifully lit jungle and a cute little frog paddling through some very realistic water.


It's technically impressive, but for some fans it's lost the art style of the original game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Microsoft's Xbox Partner Preview showcase last night, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth kicked proceedings off with a new trailer revealing one of the new side hustles.


Dondoko Island will let players escape to a deserted island off the coast of Hawaii, a "vacation within a vacation, where a cosy DIY lifestyle awaits". There's fishing, material gathering, furniture crafting, and even decora- hold on...


RGG Studio has essentially added Animal Crossing into the Like a Dragon (previously called Yakuza) series, but with the usual exaggerated wackiness the franchise has become known for. And I could not be more excited for it.

That's according to dataminers who have tapped into Blizzard's Technical Alpha build of version 2.0 on its private testing branch (thanks WccfTech).



In addition, it's believed the Kurast region from Diablo 2 will also be added - a city that fell to Mephisto's corruption.

In a new blog post, the developer said it wants to assure players that its previously announced big patch, which promised more than 200 QoL-improvements across platforms, is still a main priority for the team. 


As is its general "patching process" for Payday 3, with the developer saying the goal is to ensure future game updates will be released "at a steady cadence".

The company announced the statistic today on social media, though did not provide any concrete sales figures. We'll likely get those as part of a global sales update, or financial statement.


Regardless, it's a positive sign things have gone well for Elephant Mario and his warp pipe-stuffing chums - even if Nintendo's mascot couldn't quite beat Spider-Man 2 in the UK's boxed game chart on Monday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's Xbox Partner Preview showcase might have an exceptionally rubbish name, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's not worth a watch! Tonight's latest instalment was a pretty decent offering all-round, that, while perhaps not exciting as such, did at least have some interesting reveals. There was first footage of Konami's Metal Gear Sold 3 remake, a new game from PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab, and more. And if you're looking for a summary of it all that won't take up 30 minutes of your time, then read on.


First up, we learned Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will continue the series' tradition of extravagant side activities when it releases on 26th January next year, giving players the opportunity to manage an entire tropical island resort in pure Animal Crossing fashion. There's fishing, bug catching, crafting, and a whole lot more as detailed in the trailer below.


PowerWash simulator developer FuturLab unveiled its new game Ikaro: Will Not Die, a  spiritual successor to the studio's acclaimed Velocity series that promises "satisfying flow-state" rogue-lite action that you can read more about elsewhere.

Well, would you believe it, there's a game just for you; it's called Still Wakes the Deep and first gameplay has just debuted.


Announced back in June, Still Wakes the Deep is the latest from developer The Chinese Room - previously responsible for the likes of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Dear Esther - whisking players to the Beira D oil rig off the Scottish coast circa 1975.


What follows is a narrative-focused first-person horror adventure in which players, in the role of an off-shore oil rig worker suddenly cut off from the outside world, must "run, climb, and swim through the flooding corridors and storm-lashed outer decks" as they attempt to evade an unspeakable otherworldly forces that's invited itself onboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FuturLab, the developer behind nozzle-tweaking masterwork PowerWash Simulator, has unveiled neon-streaked action-adventure Ikaro: Will Not Die, which the studio describes a spiritual successor to its acclaimed Velocity series.


Velocity, for the uninitiated, began life as twitchy shoot-'em-up in which players piloted their ship (known as the Quarp Jet) through space in a blaze of enemy-shredded bullets. Its sequel, 2014's Velocity 2X, retained the acclaimed ship-bound action of the original, but paired it with regular on-foot sections requiring protagonist to Lieutenant Kai Tana to disembark and solve a few puzzles to clear the way forward. Eurogamer liked it a lot!


But back to Ikaro: Will Not Die; it's being billed as an action-adventure rogue-lite, that "brings the pace and precision of [the Velocity series'] satisfying flow-state action into third-person, while infusing an array of exciting new systems and mechanics."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ark: Survival Ascended - the Unreal Engine 5 remake of dino-survival hit Ark: Survival Evolved - is surprise-launching onto PC today, 25th October. However, developer Wildcard has announced a further delay for the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions, with both now due to arrive some time in November.


There has, of course, been a fair bit of controversy surrounding Ark: Survival Ascended since its announcement back in April this year; its reveal came with the news that Wildcard would be taking Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers offline when the remake arrived, forcing players to upgrade to the new version if they wanted to stay put. 


It didn't help, either, that the remake was initially only available as part of a bundle with the now-delayed Ark 2, and while Wildcard eventually scrapped those plans, it instead decided to release a standalone version of Ark: Survival Ascended that was - amazingly - exactly the same price as the original bundle, despite featuring one less game. However, that price recently fell by $5 to $44.99 after Wildcard reversed plans to include a remake of Ark's Scorched Earth expansion alongside the base map, which it said would no longer be ready for launch.

Announced back in May, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater (as the remake is officially known) retains 2004 original's story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear - as well as its voice cast.


Beyond that, Konami is promising a variety of modern-day upgrades, including improved visuals - the remake is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 - as well as evolved gameplay and a "seamless user experience", whatever that means.

Background
In the ever-evolving world of Kubernetes, networking plays a pivotal role. As more applications are
deployed in Kubernetes clusters, effective exposure of these services to clients becomes a critical
concern. If you've been working with Kubernetes, you're likely familiar with the Ingress API,
which has been the go-to solution for managing external access to services.
The Ingress API provides a way to route external traffic to your applications within the cluster,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frictional Games is celebrating the spooky season with a free update for its acclaimed WW1 horror Amensia: The Bunker, designed to make the already traumatic experience even more terrifying. And if your nerves are up to the challenge, the Halloween Update launches today.


Frictional's creative lead Fredrik Olsson began teasing a hardcore Shell Shock mode last month, detailing a few of the sadistic features it would bring, but with it now here as part of today's Halloween Update, the studio has provided a little more information on what's in store.


For starters, as previously confirmed, The Bunker's Admin Office will no longer be the safe haven it once was in Shell Shock mode; its reassuringly sturdy steel doors are replaced with wood, meaning, yes, the monster can get in. And speaking of that pursuing horror, Shell Shock mode gives it new behaviours designed to increase its unpredictability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has released a new short animation in which Detective Pikachu investigates who stole a flan from his human sidekick's fridge.
While it's not quite the Detective Pikachu film sequel we and lead actor Justice Smith may be hoping for, it's a cute, six-minute video full of detective clichés and adorable Pokémon.
Detective Pikachu begins his daily routine with a strong cup of coffee and a flick through the morning paper, filming his activities for his social media presence (even Pikachu isn't immune to becoming an influencer, I guess). Tim joins him for breakfast, only to find his flan has been taken from the fridge, so the pair get to work to figure out who took it. You can watch the video on YouTube to see who-dun-it.

Publisher Paradox Interactive previously admitted the game had "not achieved the [performance] benchmark" it wanted. Despite that, the sequel reached a concurrent peak of 104,697 players, surpassing the original's record of 60,386 concurrent players (as recorded by SteamDB).
Steam reviews for Cities: Skylines 2 are mixed however, mostly with criticisms levelled at the game's performance and some players are questioning Paradox's decision to release the game even if it believes "releasing now is the best way forward".

Payday 3's released was marred by server issues which left players unable to access the game during its launch weekend, something which developer Starbreeze blamed on a third-party matchmaking service.
While these issues have been resolved, players are still finding other problems with the game technically, and with its UI, progression, and its always-online requirement. Many Payday 3 Steam reviews compare the game to 2013's Payday 2, calling 2 a superior experience and suggesting others are better off playing that instead. Which is exactly what Payday fans look to be doing.

Nesmith, who has been part of Bethesda Softworks on and briefly off since the 90s and has worked on Skyrim, the Fallout series and Starfield, said the studio took "years of hits for not talking about Elder Scrolls 6" publicly. 


"I mean, years of hits," Nesmith said in an interview with MinnMax. "Because Todd's opinion - one which I share, by the way - is that the video game industry has short memories. Those companies that start touting their games years ahead of time, actually, you know, they screw themselves. The best time to start talking about it is six months before release." This was the strategy the studio implemented for Fallout 4.

In response, a fan has speedily released the MGSResolutionPatch PC mod, just hours after the game launched on Steam (thanks, PC Gamer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has detailed its earnings for the first quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, pointing to a record-breaking Q1 for Xbox gaming revenue, despite a 7% drop in hardware sales.


Over the course of Microsoft's Q1 2024, which covers 1st July to 30th September, Xbox generated $3.9bn USD in gaming revenue - equating to a 9% year-on-year increase - which the company attributed to strong performance from first-party titles and Game Pass.


Not coincidentally, Xbox's record-breaking Q1 encompassed the long-awaited launch of Bethesda's Starfield, which surpassed 10m players within its first few weeks of release - and in an investor call following today's fiscal report, Microsoft CEO Satyda Nadella confirmed the game provided a significant boost for Game Pass, setting the record at launch for the "most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever" (as per The Verge's Tom Warren).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive has published some very, very good games since its formation in 2016, and 12 of those titles will soon be bundled onto a single Switch cartridge. The only catch - and it's admittedly quite a big one - is that it'll cost a whopping $200.


The region-free Annapurna Interactive Deluxe Limited Edition Collection, as the mega-priced cartridge is officially known, is being released in collaboration with video game collectibles company iam8bit and - as per the "limited edition" bit - is restricted to 2,500 copies.


For your hard-earned $199.99 USD (plus, of course, a hefty chunk of VAT and import fees if you're ordering from the UK), you'll get a cartridge containing Donut County, Gorogoa, Hindsight, I Am Dead, If Found..., Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition, Neon White, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Solar Ash, The Artful Escape, The Pathless, and What Remains of Edith Finch. That is, then, some top-notch gaming in a single square inch (or thereabouts) of plastic.

        <updated>2023-10-24T19:50:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released strict new guidelines for the smaller-scale competitive tournament scene, outlining exactly what it will permit - with caps on everything from competitor numbers to ticket prices - before organisers must apply for an official license from the company.


As detailed in its new Community Tournament Guidelines - which were initially published by Nintendo of Japan before appearing in locally adjusted form on Nintendo of Europe's website earlier today - tournaments will be permitted to continue without a license after 15th November this year, provided they are "small-scale and not for commercial profit".


More specifically, these strictly limited events - which Nintendo is terming "community tournaments" - may not have more than 200 participants a day when held in-person, increasing to 300 daily participants for online tournaments. Additionally, money raised through spectator tickets and entry fees, capped at £18/€20 and £14/€15 a person respectively, must not exceed the costs of organising the tournament and raising prize money - although prize money (limited to a total of £4,500/€5,000) also cannot be generated from spectator ticket sales.

Announced back in August, the Star Wars: Dark Forces remaster is being made in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, and sees the 1995 first-person shooter - which follows mercenary Kyle Katarn as he undertakes a number of covert operations to thwart the Empire at the behest of the Rebel Alliance - getting a welcome modern-day upgrade.


Nightdive Studios - the remaster specialist behind this year's acclaimed System Shock update, among many others - is promising resolutions of up to 4K at 120fps for its enhanced Dark Forces release, although expect that to vary depending on your platform of choice.

As a reminder, this initial collection is centred around MGS1, 2 and 3. But back in June,  Konami's website appeared to suggest a future Vol 2 would continue by including MGS4, 5 and Peace Walker.


Now Vol 1 is released, that's exactly what the game's own files also suggest - via references to all three of those games spotted in its code by fans on reddit. Konami is yet to confirm Vol 2, of course, but its contents now seem fairly certain. (Sorry, Twin Snakes fans.)

The game was first released in Japan on Switch in December 2021 and has since sold over 2m copies. There's also a free browser version you can try.

The script can convert most models and plugins from both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, as well as the base game of New Vegas, from their native game engine of Gamebryo. bololo11 states the mod can't convert NPCs and creatures, quests or scripts "yet", and converted weapons and armour can't be equipped, but it's a great start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A drink driving game which was available on the Nintendo Switch eShop has been pulled from sale, after it initially used a PEGI 3+ rating.

Need for Spirit Drink & Drive Simulator was released for the Switch on 15th October, and contains gameplay of a "hapless professional driver tasked with delivering alcoholic beverages to various celebrations, all while battling the perils of abysmal roads and your very own addiction to the booze you're transporting".

With "immersive camera modes" and an added "exciting twist" of drunk vision, the game is (yes) a drink driving simulator. Its PEGI 3+ rating suggests the game is suitable for all age groups. PEGI however states a game which "refers to or depicts the use of illegal drugs, alcohol or tobacco" must be labelled as PEGI 16 or PEGI 18.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh trailer for PlayStation shows some of its most popular video game characters enjoying a game of football. 


Joel and Ellie (shown briefly enough that you could mistake them for Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey) ride on horseback into a giant footy stadium and throw the match ball to waiting players.


Platforming mascot Astrobot assists with the pre-match coin toss, while Kratos and Atreus watch from the stands, the former blowing his magical horn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 players believe they've made a breakthrough discovery in the hunt for a non-existent secret cow level.


As reported back in June, players have been seeking a secret cow level in the game, something that began as an urban myth in the original Diablo but was acknowledged by Blizzard in later games.


Blizzard has so far denied the existence of a cow level in Diablo 4, with general manager Rod Fergusson telling Kinda Funny the development team "wanted to ground [Diablo 4] as much as possible". That hasn't stopped players searching for it, however.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn's recent updates to Titanfall 2 have fans convinced the developer is teasing something for the game's seventh anniversary.
Last month, Respawn fixed matchmaking in the game, all while adding hidden references to the release dates of Titanfall, Titanfall2, and Apex Legends.
The evidence of a planned surprise for players has grown bigger, and fans now believe the studio will have some news for the Titanfall series on 28th October to mark seven years since the release of Titanfall 2.

Since 2018, one of my favourite contributions to the Kubernetes community has been to share the story of each release. Many of these stories were told on behalf of a past employer; by popular demand, I've brought them back, now under my own name. If you were a fan of the old show, I would be delighted if you would subscribe.
Back in August, we welcomed the release of Kubernetes 1.28. That release was led by Grace Nguyen, a CS student at the University of Waterloo. Grace joined me for the traditional release interview, and while you can read her story below, I encourage you to listen to it if you can.

It has, somewhat unbelievably, been over a decade since the critically lauded Hotline Miami first dropped jaws and quickened pulses with its breathless, blood-soaked top-down ode to violence, in which the game's unnamed protagonist rampages against the local Miami mafia after receiving cryptic instructions on his answering machine.


Its grisly blend of stealth and ultra-gory shooting action - augmented by a surreal narrative, a stylish fever-dream aesthetic, and an absolute stunner of a pulsing synth soundtrack - immediately won it fans (Eurogamer awarded it 10/10 at the time of its release). 2015's Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number went bigger, weirder, and tougher in almost every conceievable way, but didn't have quite the same impact the second time around.

In a new report from The Verge, developers from IguanaBee say the game was made in one year from scratch and with very little funding.

A brief teaser video posted to X, formerly Twitter, reveals the Fallout series release date: 12th April 2024.


(Of course, this date is written in the American style, so 4/12/24. But good news, it isn't debuting next December.)

That ginormous launch means Spider-Man 2 hit the 2.5m copies milestone faster than any God of War, Uncharted or The Last of Us. It's also faster to that total than Spider-Man 1.

Modder Matt Filer has given us exactly that, with a new mod he released earlier today. This also marks the first mod which swaps the Xenomorph out for something else, Filer says, which is quite surprising. Alien: Isolation seems like the perfect fodder for this kind of thing, but a quick scan on Nexus Mods shows indeed, there aren't any mods which do this already.
Filer has put a short but sweet paragraph into the mod's description: "This mod swaps the Xenomorph for Thomas the Tank Engine. I'm so sorry."

Speaking on Skill Up's Friends Per Second podcast, conversation with the developer turned to a "hypothetical" third main game in Insomniac's Spider-Man series. Inthar was understandably quiet for a good while, clearly not wanting to give too much of the studio's plans for the series away. 


However, after some careful deliberation, the developer said whatever could happen next would undoubtedly be "pretty epic".

Following the game's release last week, fans have been poring over its details. One such detail was the inclusion of a Cuban flag in Miles' house, as well as various Cuban flags in the surrounding area. However, Miles is not from Cuba. His mother, Rio Morales, is Puerto Rican, and while both flags are similar, the colours are different.


Many noticed this slip-up. Over the weekend, reddit user TheHouselessTurtle shared a screenshot from the game showing the Cuban flag inside Miles' home.

In addition, players will have the option to continue their current game retaining character, items and progression but resetting the world to allow completionists to finish outstanding tasks. A customisable NG+ modifier system is also on the way so players can tweak the experience themselves.

EA confirmed over a year ago that it was developing a single-player third-person action adventure Iron Man game as part of a new collaboration between it and Marvel for "several" new projects. And just like the Dead Space remake - which was acclaimed by critics and players alike – Motive hopes to utilise a fan-based community council to keep it on the right track.

"I can't believe it's been over a year since my last update about our beloved Motive Studio," GM Patrick Klaus said by way of a statement posted to the official website.

As spotted by VGC, a number of developers from Visual Arts Service Group have taken to social media to announce their redundancies and seek out new opportunities.

"Unfortunately, following a wave of layoffs, last week was my last at Playstation," senior level designer Daniel Bellemere – who's worked on blockbuster games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Immortals Fenyx Rising – wrote on LinkedIn.

Pierre Boudreau – an "award-winning writer for Assassin's Creed" – has posted the mysterious character as the header image for their professional profile, with many speculating that this may be the lead character for the mysterious Assassin's Creed: Codenamed Red.

Why? Well, the image shared to the Leaks and Gaming Rumours subreddit boasts a bright red background and a Japanese temple, which ties in with the little we already know about Ubisoft's next blockbuster-sized Assassin-y instalment.

Earlier this month, we warned that Counter-Strike 2 players with an AMD GPU could face a VAC ban if they activated Anti-Lag+.

Unfortunately, the way the Anti-Lag+ feature works - it does its job by "detouring engine dll functions", according to Valve - can have serious consequences for Counter-Strike 2 players who opt to turn it on.

Offering minimum, recommended, and ultra specs – as well as what you'll get if you select low, medium, and high ray tracing settings – players can assess how their machines will fare when running the PC version… and it certainly seems that you'll need a pretty powerful rig just to run it, let alone max out the performance.

The requirements, which were posted to its social media channels overnight, show that upscalers will be required for 30fps, and the game will take up around 90GB of your storage.

The newly-discovered glitch in the soccer sim popped up earlier in the week, allowing dribblers with the Trickster Playstyle to attach the ball to their calf and then simply run into the opposition's net to score.

After first acknowledging the glitch was a problem, EA has now confirmed that it has "temporarily removed" the FUT perk to prevent players from exploiting the bug in competitive play.

That's according to dozens of players posting in the game's official subreddit community, some of whom are reporting that the installation stalls when it hits 36 per cent.

According to those who've experienced the issue, it doesn't matter if they take the game back and swap it for a brand new disc – whatever mitigations they try to put in place, be that turning off internet connection, cleaning the disc, or even a factory reset – the installation always stops at the same point.

The build reportedly contains unreleased content from the lacklustre zombie shooter as well as content that made the final release back in 2018.
There is no way to purchase a legal copy of the game anymore as, just a year on from its 2018 release, Skybound revoked Starbreeze's The Walking Dead license and the beleaguered game was unceremoniously pulled from sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With reports increasingly pointing to a Switch 2 launch next year, Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has talked a little about the company's perspective on entering a new console generation, saying he believes its Nintendo Account system will help 'ease the transition'.


While Bowser, unsurprisingly, refused to comment on reports of a Switch successor specifically, he highlighted to Inverse (in the same interview where he discussed unionisation at Nintendo) the work the company has done on its single sign-in Nintendo Accounts. 


"One thing we've done with the Switch to help with that communication and transition [to a new console generation]", Bowser explained, "is the formation of the Nintendo Account. In the past, every device we transitioned to had a whole new account system. Creating the Nintendo Account will allow us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salt and Sacrifice, the follow-up to Ska Studios' enormously enjoyable 2D Soulslike Salt and Sanctuary, is making the jump to Switch and Steam (following a period of Epic Games Store exclusivity) on 7th November.


Salt and Sacrifice serves up another gloomy slab of side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat, albeit one that builds on its 2016 predecessor with a variety of new features, as players - in the role of a Marked Inquisitor - make their way across the world of Alterstone Kingdom, and its abandoned villages, dungeons, tomb-temples, and other landmarks.


Those new features include a refreshed choice of classes - Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage - plus Mage hunts, which play out as multi-part pursuits that culminate in a fearsome boss battle. There's also enhanced PvP - with new moves and different objectives depending on your chosen sect - and, for those with a more collaborative streak, two-player online and off-line co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia, the acclaimed - and previously Epic Games Store-exclusive - survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is coming to Steam on 8th November.


While Santa Ragione (which also published Lorenzo Redaelli's stellar post-COVID horror Mediterranea Inferno earlier this year) hasn't quite managed to get Saturnalia onto Steam in time for Halloween, it remains a spookily good time - whisking players away to the ancient village of Gravoi for an Sardinian folklore-inspired adventure that Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin called a "horrible nightmare in all the right ways" in his Recommended review.


The aim of Saturnalia is to solve the mystery of Gravoi and escape its confines, exploring and avoiding its horrors along the way. To that end, players can switch between four different characters at will as they try to win their freedom, but if everyone dies, the town reconfigures its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a year that's seen significant moves toward unionisation across the games industry, Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has argued the reason the company doesn't have unions is because its workers have a "high degree of job satisfaction and engagement".


Bowser shared his thoughts in an interview with Inverse, saying, "You only have to look at our retention numbers, which are very, very high within the industry, and our obviously low turnover rate as a result. Our focus has always been on creating a culture that's inclusive, has a work-life balance, and is focused on our singular mission of bringing smiles to faces."


Bowser added he believes Nintendo is "on the right path" when it comes to creating a "work environment and culture that allows people to be productive, to have balance in their lives, and to grow within the company".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss what's next for Microsoft and Activision Blizzard now they have finally tied the knot.
This week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer sounded a note of caution over how quickly we'd see the fruits of Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition for ourselves. There will be no immediate drop of Activision classics on Xbox Game Pass, and no sudden insertion of Master Chief in Call of Duty. 
Long-term, though, Spencer is keen to hear from Activision's teams about what they want to make - whether that's a return to Guitar Hero, Skylanders or Tony Hawk games, or something else entirely. We also ponder Microsoft's plans for a mobile game presence, driven by Candy Crush maker King. Could Gears of War turn up on mobile? What about Viva Piñata? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

This brisk performance was achieved by Mae, a known speedrunner in the Baldur's Gate 3 community. Mae previously managed to complete a Sex Any% speedrun in just under eight minutes, and has been whittling that time down ever since. 


"After just over two months, the Baldur's Gate 3 speedrunning community has finally peaked. The two minute barrier has been shattered," Mae celebrated on their YouTube channel earlier today. "We can now bang Lae'zel in under two minutes, even faster than a speedrunner can last in real life. This is the world's first sub-two minute run and the new world record."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 released today, with a storyline that developer Insomniac has said will take, on average, about 15 hours to complete if you just stick to the main story missions. If players decide to delve deeper, and complete side missions and collectables, that gameplay time could be extended to around 40 hours. 


When it first came to light that Spider-Man 2's main story could be wrapped up in a relatively short amount of time - especially when compared to the likes of this year's Baldur's Gate 3, which can take players literal days to complete - some felt that Insomniac was asking too high a price for its sequel. Here in the UK, Spider-Man 2 is £69.99 for the standard PS5 edition. If players want to upgrade to the digital deluxe version, it will set them back £79.99. 


Many have argued that game length should influence the retail price of a product, and therefore Spider-Man 2 should be priced lower than what is essentially £70. Insomniac's creative director Bryan Intihar has weighed in on this, and said that Spider-Man 2 is absolutely "worth it".

The "calf dribble", as it's been dubbed by some in the FIFA community, allows dribblers with the Trickster Playstyle to attach the ball to their calf and then simply run into the opposition's net to score.
As funny as it is to watch, that's definitely not how it's meant to work, in video game or real-life football.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Friday, and I have found another fun thing to share with you all, this time in Halo Infinite's Forge mode.

Halo Infinite's Forge mode has long been used as a canvas for many video game related homages. We have seen the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's iconic Kokiri Forest pop up here, as well as PT's terrifying corridor and Call of Duty's famous Shipment map. Blood Gulch is even in there (although, actually that one wasn't really a surprise, but all the same very cool)


The possibilities this mode can invoke are seemingly endless, and the recent update that came with Season 5: Reckoning has made this even more apparent. You see, developer 343 added the ability to include Campaign AI. This is thanks to the addition of Forge's AI Toolkit and its accompanying suite of features, which means Halo Infinite players can now spawn Grunts and such into their creations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are looking forward to swinging back into the world of Peter Parker and Miles Morales in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 but are concerned about not remembering the story so far, don't worry. Insomniac has you covered.


The developer has released a helpful trailer to fill you in on everything that happened in both Marvel's Spider-Man and Miles Morales. The trailer shows our two webbed heroes recalling past battles against the likes of Dr Otto Octavius. They also reflect on their lost loved ones, like Aunt May and Miles' dad, Jefferson "Jeff" Davis. It's touching stuff.


Now, if you were watching that and thinking "Great! I love Spider-Man, and even with the sequel just out I already want more", you may also be asking yourself: "Venom I going to get a villain-focused spinoff, in the style of Spider-Man: Miles Morales?"

The company said its donation would be split between the Japanese Red Cross and UNICEF. Sony employees can also add their own money, which the company will then match.


"Sony respects and supports the human rights of all people," Sony said in a statement. "We strongly oppose terrorism, violence against civilians, hate, and other acts that threaten human life, livelihood, and dignity, and wish for the restoration of peace in the region."

Astral Planes will bring "reality-breaking" technology to Stellaris, giving players the chance to explore new parallel dimensions - encountering strange new creatures, long-buried secrets, and mysterious phenomena along the way.


Paradox says Astral Planes is predominantly focused on delivering "mid-to-late game exploration content", introducing 30 Astral Rifts where players can experience branching narratives and storylines - utilising a "dedicated interface, specifically designed to maximize the effects of player choice" - taking place in completely different realms of existence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors developer Poncle is giving us a bit of a two-for-one with its minimalist survival RPG's latest free update, combining sufficiently spooksome chills for Halloween and all the snow-speckled wintery fun you might reasonably require when things start to get a bit jollier later on. It's called the Chilling Update (because of all the snow, yes?) and it's available now.


The Chilling Update - also known as v1.7.0 - introduces a new playable character, a new bonus stage, a new evolving weapon, two new relics, six new EXTRA achievements, and a new music track. If that's enough information to get you salivating and you'd rather avoid spoiling the fun before diving in, stop reading now - otherwise it's time to go through all the above in more detail, starting with the new stage, Whiteout.


Whiteout is described a "20-minute bonus stage" in Poncle's patch notes, and it's unlocked by picking up a total of 20 Orologions. Once inside, players will encounter snowmen insistent on blocking their path, and face enemies which, according to Poncle, move very slowly and are particularly susceptible to fire. "So for most of it," the studio explains, "there isn't anything particularly challenging" - although you might want to save your spicy sausage for the boss.

As is the way with these things, Conduit - described by developer Respawn as a "tiny titan of optimism" - gets her introduction by way of a new Stories from the Outlands lore trailer. And, yes, there's more Titanfall fan-baiting to try and distract everyone from the fact we still haven't got a Titanfall 3, despite persistent teasing from the studio.


Once upon time, you see, Conduit's life was saved by a Monarch Titan during a violent battle that threatened to destroy her hometown - the machine's pilot choosing to sacrifice themselves in a massive detonation that would ultimately bring fighting to an explosive end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been three years since Ubisoft announced it was working on a VR instalment of Assassin's Creed, and with the game - now officially titled Assassin's Creed Nexus VR - nearing its release, the company has shared an extensive eight-minute gameplay breakdown to get players in the mood ahead of its November launch on Meta Quest 2, 3, and Pro.


Assassin's Creed Nexus VR (which Ubisoft describes as an "all-new full-length Assassin's Creed action-adventure game") casts players as an elite hacker working undercover at Abstergo on behalf of the Brotherhood. From here, they'll be able to shove their eyes into the heads of three returning series protagonists - Ezio Auditore, Connor, and Kassandra - in an attempt to locate a number of mysterious artefacts they encountered during their lives.


It's a quest that, in classic series fashion, will see players scrambling, sneaking, stabbing, and clobbering their way around some big open maps, this time spanning Renaissance Italy, Colonial America, and Ancient Greece - including Venice, Boston, and even some new locations such as Newport (presumably the Rhode Island one and not the one in Wales).

That's according to Insomniac's director of community and marketing, James Stevenson, who shared the news in answer to a fan query on social media. "We' re working on an update for those features," he explained, adding, "but they won't be in Day 1."


Insomniac's original Marvel's Spider-Man launched in September 2018 and received a New Game Plus mode just one month later - and it appears the studio is aiming to add the feature to Spider-Man 2 in a similarly brisk fashion, with Stevenson later explaining Insomniac is hoping to get New Game Plus out to players "before end of year."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has released a big budget live-action Xbox Series X/S advert, timed for the holiday season, which showcases several high-profile console exclusives. 


The advert begins with a young woman making her way home from what is presumably a long day at work. As Nintendo did earlier in the year when it released its live-action Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, Microsoft seems to be highlighting the welcome relief games can provide, away from the everyday, rain-soaked mundane. 


This young lady in question is soon swept out of her apartment block's lift and transported into a world of wonder and excitement. Starfield's Vasco holds her bag as a spaceship blasts off. Her world turns upside down again, as the wandering whispers of Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 surround her. She leaves, to suddenly find her corridor turned into a Forza racetrack, and then find a random Cyberpunk 2077 chap in her flat chopping up pineapples with furious force. You get the idea.

For those unfamiliar, this is generally how new FM games roll out each year, with a period of up to a month before the official release date - in FM24's case, 6th November - being marked out as a kind of final public test, which you can gain access to by pre-ordering the game with a small discount.
It's the same again here, albeit with just two-and-a-half weeks until it's out this time, and with the shift to calling it Early Access from now on, as Sports Interactive gaffer Miles Jacobson is keen to emphasise.

Donlan summed it up in his Super Mario Bros. Wonder review for us: "But Elephant Mario is the star. What a guy."
Nintendo seemingly knew Elephant Mario would be a big hit with fans, as there's already a plush in the works by regular official collaborator Sanei Bokei, due for release in January 2024.

Reddick stars as Hellboy in Web of Wyrd, a roguelike action brawler. It promises an original story, which the studio has curated in partnership with Dark Horse Comics as well as Hellboy's own creator Mike Mignola, although one which doesn't interfere with what Mignola himself is up to. 


"When an agent of the BPRD goes missing, Hellboy is sent to investigate; pulling him into the depths of the Wyrd," the game's description reads. You can see how it looks, and hear the late, great Lance Reddick, in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, Marvel's Spider-Man 2's fast-travel hold-to-confirm prompt is not hiding a load point. It could have been even faster, but developer Insomniac made the decision to value player usability over speed and scoring points on the internet.


Spider-Man 2's fast-travel capabilities have been widely shared across social media, and are so slick that some players have said they believe the requirement to hold down a button and confirm your fast-travelling before shooting off across the game's map was all designed as a bit of trickery to hide background loading. 


Well, that's not the case. This theory has now been squashed by Insomniac's own director of core technologies Mike Fitzgerald. As part of a ResetEra thread discussing Spider-Man 2's review scores, Fitzgerald said Insomniac discussed removing the hold-to-confirm prompt in a bid to "address that accusation", before it ultimately decided this wasn't the best idea.

As you can see in the video, JSR_ directs Peanut Butter to press buttons and gives him a reward for doing so. "This took years of training," JSR_ said, adding that no assistance, autofire, macro, or states were used.

The earbuds would be stored in a pair of slots located inside the controller. As well as charging them, the controller would also pair the earbuds to a console.
The patent (spotted by GameRant) contains different variations of where the earbuds could be slotted into the controller. Most of the designs propose the earbuds are stored behind the touchpad, though one option places an earbud in each of the controller's grips.

Patch 1.1.203 was released yesterday which fixed a number of stability issues to prevent crashes. In addition, subtantial performance improvements have been implemented to free up VRAM and "provide additional headroom for GPUs that are operating at the limit of their capabilities".



Thankfully some balance changes have also been made. For instance, the price of seeds has now been reduced - these are used to create temporary checkpoints throughout the world but were an expensive and limited resource.

<p>Prosecutors also accused Sullivan of attempting to conceal the breach itself by paying $100,000 to buy the silence of the two hackers behind the compromise.

As detailed over on Xbox Wire, players will soon be able to remap almost 90 keyboard keys - or combinations of keys - to any button on the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2, meaning users with limited mobility can, for instance, use the Xbox Adaptive Controller with games that would ordinarily only support mouse/keyboard.


The feature - which will be available through the Xbox Accessories app on PC and console - is currently being tested by Xbox Insiders and Xbox Accessibility Insiders League (XAIL) members, but is due to launch for all players at some point "in the coming months".

Gwent, of course, started life as a turn-based card-collecting mini-game in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (although, technically, it existed on the page of author Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher novels before that) and was expanded into its own full-scale release in 2018.


As development has continued, Gwent has recieved new cards, content updates, and expansions - as well as a standalone single-player story campaign in 2020's Thronebreaker and a rogue-like solo deck-builder in 2022's Gwent: Rogue Mage - but last December brought the news CD Projekt would wind down development after three new expansions in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox has confirmed Cities: Skylines 2 won't be getting official mod support until sometime after next week's release, with the feature set to arrive alongside its first wave of modding tools.


Official mod support was one of the original Cities: Skylines' most exciting features when it launched back in 2015, and the city builder quickly developed a vibrant modding scene that played a significant role in its early success. More than 333,000 mods are now available for the first Cities: Skylines via Steam Workshop, and Paradox has even tapped modders to create official DLC for the game over the years.


As for Cities: Skylines' imminent sequel, Paradox broke the news that mods would not be officially supported at launch in a developer diary shared on its website. And while it hasn't yet offered an estimated time of arrival for the feature, it's now published a second mod-focused developer update explaining official mod tools and mod support will arrive simulataneously post-release, once Cities: Skylines 2's all-in-one Editor leaves beta testing.

Mega Crit was one of many developers to criticise Unity's decision to begin charging studios fees based on the number times their game was installed by a user (Unity has since walked back on some of its changes, and CEO John Riccitiello departed not long after), writing, "Despite the immense amount of time and effort our team has already poured into the development on our new title, we will be migrating to a new engine unless the changes are completely reverted and [Terms of Service] protections are put in place."


Shortly after Unity's controversial announcement, Mega Crit held a three-week game jam to "explore the Godot engine due to 'recent events'". The result of those experiments is Dancing Duelists, a "deckbuilding autobattler dance off with a BUMPIN' soundtrack".

"Tezuka-san also once asked, 'Can't we have live commentary?'. I had absolutely no clue what he meant. But I interpreted it as a desire for a new experience, even if it's not necessarily in the form of live commentary," said Shiro Mouri, the game's director.

Second Extinction is a co-op, online shooter set in a futuristic world where mutated dinosaurs threaten humans. It released in early access for PC in 2020, and Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021. The game's 1.0 version was meant to release late last year, but "critical" and "show-stopping" issues caused the studio to delay it.
"Unfortunately, it became clear that our small team lacked the resources necessary to hit our quality targets," Systemic Reaction said on Steam, "and the investment needed to do so was too large for us to bear". As such, the developer has decided to cancel the game's full release.

Spencer even noted there had been "a lot of uncertainty" in the buyout process for Microsoft - right up until the deal was finally approved by the UK's regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The co-op horror game Phasmophobia will not release on consoles this month, following another delay.

Phasmophobia was originally meant to release into early access on console in August, but an office fire incident in August caused developer Kinect Games to push launch back to October.

The release date is being pushed back again, meaning Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait a little bit longer to join the ghost-hunting. In a developer update posted to Steam, Kinect Games attributed the latest delay to August's fire incident and issues in porting the game to consoles and VR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox head Phil Spencer has shed more light on what Microsoft's recent acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision will mean for the series, and no, it isn't about using timed exclusivity deals for the franchise in order to sell consoles. 


In an interview on the official Xbox podcast, the exec spoke more about last week's historic merger that finally saw Microsoft close the deal on its Activision Blizzard King buyout. He phil-ed us in, if you will. 


Of course, during last night's interview, the topic of Call of Duty came up. This series has often been front and centre of the ongoing trials and tribulations of recent times. In fact, at one point, Sony suggested Microsoft could deliberately release a version of the game on PlayStation platforms with degraded performance (something Microsoft said it would not do).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stairway Games has announced its tropical island farming sim Coral Island will be getting its 1.0 release on 14th November after just over a year of PC early access, and it'll be launching for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 on the same day.


Coral Island, which entered early access last October on Steam and the Microsoft Store, is yet another entry in the ever-growing list of farming sims heavily inspired by Stardew Valley's more modern take on the genre (it even has an evil corporate entity of its own), but it's aiming to set itself apart with a focus on ocean exploration and conservation.


Of course, all the familiar genre staples are present and correct too, including farming, crafting, fishing, mining, decorating, socialising, and, of course, wooing, with Coral Island featuring 25 eligible islanders to romance as one season gives way to the next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 8.28pm: Diablo 4's Season of Blood is now live on all platforms following a last-minute delay which Blizzard blamed on "complications". Unfortunately, not all technical issues have been resolved as yet, and Blizzard has been forced to temporarily disable cross-play between PC and consoles while it attempts to find a solution.


"We are working to resolve this," the developer explained in an update on social media, "and will provide updates as they are available."


Season of Blood arrives alongside Diablo 4's Steam release, which also saw a bit of a delay earlier today. It comes with a 25% launch week discount, ending on 24th October, meaning you can currently pick it up for £44.99 instead of the usual £59.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has announced it is parting ways with BattleTech developer Harebrained Schemes, citing "strategic and creative priorities". The seperation follows last week's news that Harebrained Schemes' The Lamplighters League has been a $22m flop for Paradox.


Harebrained was founded in 2011 by Mitch Gitelman and Jordan Weisman (co-creator of the BattleTech and MechWarrior universe), and was acquired by Paradox Interactive in 2018 after it published the studio's critically acclaimed BattleTech game that same year.


The Lamplighters League, which launched earlier this month, was Harebrained's first release as a Paradox studio but it arrived to middling reviews and failed to generate much commercial interest. Paradox went as far as to call its commercial performance a "big disappointment" last week, when it admitted the pulp strategy game was unlikely to recoup its development costs, resulting in a $22.7m USD write-down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're super-excited for the release of Alan Wake 2 later this month, but can't quite recall the events of the first game (entirely reasonably seeing as the original version came out over a decade ago), Fortnite of all places might have the answer. Epic has whacked a free playable 20-minute Alan Wake recap episode that should serve as a refresher while offering a bit of spooky battery gobbling fun along the way.


Alan's first adventure, released all the way back in 2010, sees the eponymous writer taking a working holiday with his wife, Alice, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls. Needless to say, it doesn't take long for things to go awry, and, soon, Alan - with occasional help from his agent BARRY - is monologuing his way through the night, blasting malevolent beings to smithereens with his torch and revealing the next big spooky event 10 seconds before it happens because he can't keep his mouth shut.


Or at least that's how I remember it. Presumably Epic's newly released Alan Wake: Flashback - a 'reimagining' of the original tale, developed in collaboration with Remedy Entertainment, Spiral House, and Zen Creative - will do a better and more reliable job of filling you in on all the important story beats ahead of Alan Wake 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exactly 364 after its announcement, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught - NetherRealm's free-to-play character-collecting RPG - is out of beta testing and available to download on iOS and Android.


Mortal Kombat: Onslaught's big selling point is its "mobile-exclusive" story - promising "high quality graphics, cinematic cutscenes, and bone-krushing kombat" - that'll see players joining forces with Raiden in a bid to prevent fallen Elder God Shinnok from gathering relics and regaining his evil powers. All that plays out through "massive real-time group battles", featuring up to ten fighters at once, that'll require players to tailor their team of four champions to take on progressively more difficult challenges.


More specifically, progress involves collecting and assembling a team from a "massive" catalogue of Assassins, Warriors, Snipers, and Defenders - including the familiar likes of Sub-Zero, Liu Kang, Scorpion, and Kitana, plus "rare, fan-favourite variants" such as Cyrax and Smoke. Each comes with its own unique Special Moves, Affinities and Passive Skills, and players will need to evolve their characters' combat skills, level their gear, and equip Relics.

The reason for that may be the state of the game at release. Full walkthroughs and cutscene footage have been shared on social media and are gaining traction for the game's poor quality.
IguanaBee is a small studio based in Chile which developed party game Headsnatchers and third person shooter G.I. Joe: Operation Blackout. GameMill Entertainment is a company which has published games for franchises through licensing deals. Its most successfully published title is Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, which a sequel is in development for.

Epic only acquired Bandcamp, the self-styled "online record store and music community", last year. As we reported back in 2022, the Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer said this acquisition was all part of its vision to build out a "creator marketplace ecosystem". Its subsequent sale to Songtradr was then announced last month.


In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Epic confirmed the recent Bandcamp layoffs were part of its previous wave of cuts, which were announced at the end of September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a mere few days away from release and the reviews and impressions have started rolling in across the web (no pun intended, but isn't it nice when it just happens). Many have praised the game's action, slick traversal and story, but one area that has been highlighted away from your typical professional assessment is the puddles. 

Some players felt the first Spider-Man game was lacking in the puddle density department, noting the game's E3 2017 gameplay trailer had larger and better defined puddles than in the released version. This caused quite a stir on social media and was eventually dubbed "puddlegate".

Insomniac took this all in its stride, and actually added a playful fix for Spider-Man's puddlegate in the form of puddle stickers. However, it's already clear its sequel won't need stickers to 'fix' its puddles, as they are looking pretty dense and wet from where I am sitting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Epic's announcement in August it would give third-party developers 100 percent of revenue for six months of Epic Games Store exclusivity on new games, the company - which laid off 16% of its workforce earlier this month - is now attempting to get developers on its storefront by promising 100% revenue on their back catalogue titles.


Today marks the official launch of the company's Epic First Run scheme, described as an "opt-in exclusivity program for third-party developers and publishers" that promises to boost Epic's usual 88% revenue cut for developers all the way up to 100% if they agree to keep their new game exclusive to the Epic Games Store for the first sixth months of release.


And the company is now complementing that offer by pledging to give developers - in a scheme it's calling Now On Epic - a six-month 100% revenue cut for bringing over games "currently live on another third-party PC store or included in a third-party subscription service available on another third-party PC store". Games must have been released on other storefronts before 31st October this year, and after six months of being on the Epic Games Store, revenue reverts to Epic's standard 88%/12% split.

Payday 3 got off to a wobbly start in September, with the game drawing criticism for its matchmaking issues, its online-only requirements (proving particularly irksome for solo players forced into lengthy queues), and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system.


Matchmaking has now been improved, and Starbreeze has pledged at least "some changes" to progression, but Payday 3's first patch is still eagerly awaited given that it promises some "200+" quality of life improvements for all platforms.

However, rather than delaying the game to remedy those issues the publisher has decided "releasing now is the best way forward".


The somewhat astonishing admission was shared in a post on the official Paradox forum, written to address "concerns raised about Cities: Skylines 2 performance" following the publisher's decision to increase Cities Skylines 2's minimum and recommended specs on PC and to delay the game on Xbox and PS5 into spring next year.


"Cities: Skylines 2 is a next-gen title, and naturally, it demands certain hardware requirements," the publisher wrote. "With that said, while our team has worked tirelessly to deliver the best experience possible, we have not achieved the benchmark we targeted."

Layers of Fear (again, the new one) already featured a decent chunk of new content, of course, reconfiguring the stories of Layers of Fear 1 and 2, as well as the first game's Inheritance DLC, into a single narrative - all spruced up with striking Unreal Engine 5 visuals and new gameplay elements. And then there's a new story chapter featuring the original protagonist's wife, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer.


Bloober's newly announced Halloween/birthday treat makes yet another tortured artist - joining the Painter, Actor, Musician, and Writer from the base game - playable in Layers of Fear, this time dropping players into the director;s seat as they take the reins of a troubled Hollywood production. "Immerse yourself into the psyche of the movie's creator as you seek to complete your final masterpiece," Bloober teases, "even as the set around you descends into chaos".

        <updated>2023-10-16T17:41:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix is reportedly looking to build upon its current, predominantly mobile-focused gaming offerings by introducing "higher-end" titles to its subscription catalogue - and is said to have had discussions about licensing a Grand Theft Auto game as part of the move.


The streaming company took its first tentative steps into gaming back in November 2021, with the release of five iOS and Android titles that could be downloaded and played as part of a Netflix subscription. Since then, its gaming catalogue has swelled to over 70 titles and it's made a number notable acquisitions, including Triple Town and Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox, The Walking Dead mobile developer Next Games, and Oxenfree creator Night School Studio.


Hints of more ambitious gaming plans at Netflix came with last November's announcement the company had set up a new Los Angeles studio - lead by former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny - to create a brand-new triple-A, third-person RPG for PC. And a new report from the Wall Street Journal has shed further light on Netflix plans, saying the company is "taking steps to expand into higher-end games that can be streamed from TVs or PCs."

Party Play is designed to reward groups of people playing alongside each other in the real world, with gameplay bonuses, extra challenges and the ability to see each others' avatars in-game on Pokémon Go's map.


Perhaps most enticing for players is a new Party Power raid bonus, which will double the damage of Charged Attacks in the game's popular PVE battles.

Hines said this was not a decision he came to easily, but "after an amazing career, culminating in the incredible launch of Starfield, it feels like the time is right."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After Cyberpunk 2077's much anticipated release in 2020 failed to live up to expectations, the team's morale took a "significant hit". 


That's according to Colin Walder, an engineering director at CD Projekt Red with over 15 years of experience in the games industry, who previously worked on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Rockstar titles Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto 5. Walder recently spoke to invenglobal at the Inven Game Conference in South Korea, where he discussed lessons learned from Cyberpunk 2077. 


"This approach we had, the way we were working production-wise, creating demos, and moving towards an agile mindset and workflow - it's about ensuring we're on top of certain things from the start," Walder said. "Take consoles, for example; we need to make sure they're functioning from the get-go. For our next project, Polaris [part of a new trilogy of games in CDPR's Witcher series], we're already running our demos and internal reviews on the console from the very beginning."

<blockquote><p>Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Persi Diaconis. The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started&#8212;Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51%.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Could future coin tossers use the same-side bias to their advantage? The magnitude of the observed bias can be illustrated using a betting scenario. If you bet a dollar on the outcome of a coin toss (i.e., paying 1 dollar to enter, and winning either 0 or 2 dollars depending on the outcome) and repeat the bet 1,000 times, knowing the starting position of the coin toss would earn you 19 dollars on average. This is more than the casino advantage for 6 deck blackjack against an optimal-strategy player, where the casino would make 5 dollars on a comparable bet, but less than the casino advantage for single-zero roulette, where the casino would make 27 dollars on average. These considerations lead us to suggest that when coin flips are used for high-stakes decision-making, the starting position of the coin is best concealed...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

All of which comes as Mojang announces an absolutely monster milestone: Minecraft has now sold over 300m copies, meaning it's still the best-selling game to date, but is now well over 100m sales ahead of its nearest rival, GTA 5.


Back to Minecraft Live, though, and Mojang's celebrations began with the reveal of Minecraft's Star Wars: Path of the Jedi DLC, which comes to the in-game Marketplace on 7th November. It'll give players the chance to rise through the ranks from padawan to Jedi Knight - meaning, yes, there's lightsaber combat and Force powers - on a journey featuring familiar Star Wars characters and locations to explore.


There's more Minecraft DLC on the way in the form of a tie-in with the BBC's upcoming Planet Earth 3, promising to "immerse players in the wonders of the natural world". It'll be available via Minecraft Education and the Minecraft Marketplace when it arrives in 2024.

"The Van Gogh Museum and The Pokémon Company International take the safety and security of visitors and staff very seriously," the museum said in a statement, as spotted by our pals at VGC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's favourite time traveller, Doctor Who, has arrived in Magic: The Gathering. 

Accompanied by "their companions, their foes, and more", The Doctor is now available in four Commander decks. These "all feature new-to-Magic cards" include reprints with new Doctor Who-themed art and feature cards "that will be legal in Legacy, Vintage, and Commander", although the cards have chiefly been designed for the latter.

"The four decks feature Doctors grouped together from the show’s history," Wizards of the Coast explain. "Blast From the Past features the first eight Doctors. Timey-Wimey highlight the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Doctors. Paradox Power showcases the Twelfth and Thirteenth Doctors."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Counting down the seconds until Insomniac's hotly-anticipated Spider-Man sequel, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, arrives? Well, here's an action-packed minute of Spidey-flavoured footage to help tide you over.

Admittedly, it's a bit of a stretch calling it a "launch trailer" given we have five days yet to wait, but nonetheless, it does a sterling job of whetting appetites ahead of the big release on 20th October. 

Captured on the PS5 and including a "mix of gameplay and in-game cinematics", the 1m13s teaser reminds us of the story so far, and what, exactly, is at stake this time around.

"The realms will tremble under the weight of the Viltrum Empire. Omni-Man approaches our timeline," the team teases, before urging players to "get the Premium Edition now" in order to play as Omni-Man.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie RPG Inkbound has pledged to remove its battle pass and all microtransactions by the end of October.

In a statement posted to Steam, developer Shiny Shoe said the decision came after it noted that "industry and player sentiment is trending against the presence of these features" and whilst it had always tried to be "as generous and straightforward as possible", it had resolved to remove in-game monetisation "completely" by 27th October 2023. 

Whilst the team says in-game monetisation supported the ongoing development of the game and was "100 per cent optional", content from the existing battle passes – called Levelling Passes here – will now be turned into cosmetic-only optional "supporter packs" DLCs sold on Steam.

That's according to True Trophies, which asserts that its own scanners have picked up "new evidence" to suggest PS5 games available on PC may soon support PlayStation trophies, enabling PC players to pick up the bronze, silver, gold, and platinum awards regardless of what platform they use.

According to True Trophies' scanners, a new platform called "PSPC" recently popped up alongside a new trophy list simply entitled "Trophy Set". Depending upon who you listen to, the "PSPC" could stand for "PlayStation PC" or "PlayStation Studios PC" – right now, we just don't know.

"Check out some of the best quality-of-life changes coming with Season of Blood," the Diablo account said on its Twitter/X account alongside a two-minute-long video that showcased some of those changes… so people did. And some, like streamer and YouTuber Taxxanterax, had a lot to say in response.

As spotted by PCGN, shortly after the video was posted, streamer and YouTuber Raxxanterax posted a video offering some "constructive feedback" after noting several mistakes, including inverted before/after map layouts, and a side-by-side comparison of what is described as "improved" horse speed that looks almost identical.

And it's good news, taking the form of a 'Steam Deck Verified' yes.


I'll be honest, I've not actually played Diablo 4, but its predecessor was an absolute treat to have readily, portably to hand on Switch, so I can very much see why fans of Blizzard's latest would be keen for news on its Steam Deck compatibility.


And, thankfully, Diablo's global community development director Adam Fletcher had good news to share when he broached the topic in response to fan queries on social media. "We can happily say," Fletcher wrote, "that Diablo 4 will be Steam Deck Verified starting next Tuesday with the launch of the game on Steam and the start of Season of Blood!".

Here's what's going on; AMD's newly released Adrenalin Edition 23.10.1 driver adds, among other things, Anti-Lag+ support for Counter-Strike 2, which, on the face of it, seems like an entirely positive thing. After all, who wouldn't want less lag in their fiercely competitive online shooty game?


Unfortunately, the way the Anti-Lag+ feature works - it does its job by "detouring engine dll functions", according to Valve - can have serious consequences for Counter-Strike 2 players who opt to turn it on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Microsoft's $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition now officially a done deal as of today, Ubisoft has been discussing its new ownership of all Activision Blizzard streaming rights, which also kick in today - and as part of the conversation, it's talked a little about physical media, saying that while interesting might decline as streaming rises, it doesn't think it's "going away".


Ubisoft secured the streaming rights to all Activision Blizzard games (for the next 15 years, and outside the EU, at least) as part of revisions made by Microsoft to get its proposed acquisition across the finish line after UK regulators blocked the deal highlighting concerns around its potential impact on the emerging cloud gaming market.


With the deal now approved and Microsoft officially the owner of Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft's role as streaming rights licensor of Activision's games has come into effect too. The Assassin's Creed publisher has shared a Q&A to mark the occasion, discussing its view on the future of game streaming and clarifying some aspects of its agreement with Microsoft - including reconfirmation Activision Blizzard games are coming to its own Ubisoft+ subscription service.

This is the first concrete detail we've heard about his new game at 22Cans since he teased it last year at a Gamelab conference, saying it has a mechanic which has "never been seen in a game" before.
Molyneux revealed the game is currently codenamed MOAT, an acronym, last month.

In a statement shared with Eurogamer, the CWA said today's merger represents a "milestone" in the industry.


"Under the terms of a ground-breaking, legally-binding labour neutrality agreement, Microsoft will remain neutral when Activision Blizzard employees express interest in joining a union, providing a clear path to collective bargaining for almost 10,000 workers," the CWA said, with its president Claude Cummings Jr calling this a "new day" for Activision Blizzard employees following mass employee protests in 2021.

A statement from Xbox boss Phil Spencer says similar, with Kotick's tenure at the company set to continue through "the end of 2023" to "ensure a smooth and seamless integration". 


Neither notice makes it explicit what will happen next year, though the wording of both statements suggests Kotick's departure is possible as early as January 2024.

This "Really Useful Starfield" mod was created and uploaded by the aptly named Trainwiz, who has kindly provided us with a rather sinister backstory explaining Thomas' arrival in space.


"For his crimes against God and his invention of murder, Thomas was smote, thusly. Rejected from Hell and obviously never going to get into Heaven, they say that the Tank Engine has been banished to wander the stars forever, unable to satiate his bloodlust and unable to find peace in his heart," Trainwiz begins.

The game has been available for press and content creators ahead of its release today, with frequent patches attempting to stabilise its performance.


The Xbox version was not made available for review and it appears the delay in this patch may be the reason.

This leaves the door open for Microsoft to finally complete its proposed $68.7bn acquisition of the Call of Duty and Overwatch maker, over a year and half since it was first announced.


In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), the CMA wrote: "We've cleared the new deal for Microsoft to buy Activision without cloud gaming rights. In August, Microsoft made a concession that would see Ubisoft, instead of Microsoft, buy Activision's cloud gaming rights.

        <updated>2023-10-13T00:31:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been looking to stock up on the spooks and scares in anticipation of this year's impending Halloween, the Epic Games Store has your back; next week's freebie over there is The Evil Within, the acclaimed horror from Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami. And it's joined by the Eurogamer recommended Eternal Threads.


The Evil Within - which was created by Ghostwire: Tokyo and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, the studio Mikami departed earlier this year - released all the way back in 2014, dragging players, in the role of rugged police detective Sebastian Castellanos, along on a positively bonkers ride through the shape-shifting likes of a dilapidated asylum, a fading mansion, a mannequin factory, and more.


It's a return to the kind of nail-bitingly tense third-person survival horror Mikami's Resident Evil games - particularly the revolutionary Resident Evil 4 - were known for, and it all plays out like an enthusiastic love letter to the horror genre as a whole, packing in everything from sadistic chainsaw-wielding cannibals to J-horror-style hair ghosts. It's great, despite a few rough edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a dramatic day for internet-sleuthing Mario fans; with Nintendo still tightlipped on who'll take over the role of the iconic plumber following Charles Martinet's acension to "Mario Ambassador", a fresh leak appeared to have finally revealed video gaming's current biggest secret. However, the actor in question - one Mick Wingert - has now thrown a bit of a spanner in the works by declaring that, no, it's not actually him.


To rewind a bit, all this started when (thanks VGC) an anonymous 4chan forum user shared images and details said to be from a US kiosk demo for Switch's soon-to-be-released Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Some of those images revealed previously unseen areas of the game, suggesting the leak was, in fact, legit - suddenly making an accompanying 20-strong unverified list of Mario Wonder voice actors a lot more interesting.


Now relatively sure of the list's veracity, internet sleuths began combing through the names - unhelpfully provided with no hint of the roles they're playing in-game - trying to figure out if one them might just be the new voice of Mario. To cut a long story short, after removing returning Mario series voice actors, indentifiable foreign language actors, and female actors, only two names remained: Kevin Afghani and Mick Wingert.

Alien: Blackout follows Amanda Ripley (daughter of Ellen Ripley) as she attempts to guide four survivors to safety aboard the Xenomorph-infested Mendel Station, viewing their progress through security cameras and via an overhead station map.


It's officially "not related" to Creative Assembly's superb 2014 first-person horror Alien: Isolation, despite being set just a few days after the game and sharing a protagonist - although that bit of information wasn't revealed until Blackout's announcement began to draw ire from fans angry at what appeared to be a sequel releasing exclusively for mobile.

EA Sports FC Tactical was first mentioned during EA's grand unveiling for its new-look football series back in July. At the time, information on the game was limited, but the publisher has now shared a little more as pre-registration opens via the iOS App Store and Google Play.


EA says Tactical is all about "in-game strategies, such as stamina and power-play management", and it reimagines EA Sports FC's usual match action as a turn-based experience, with opponents taking it in turns to defend, attack, perform skill moves, and attempt to score goals.

All in all, it's a pretty straightforward offering, packing in the Xbox Series S (which comes with 512GB storage as standard), a wireless controller, an HDMI cable, and the aforementioned three months of Game Pass Ultimate - all for £249.99.


It's the latter that sets the Starter Bundle apart from Microsoft's usual £250 Xbox Series S offering, of course, meaning you're basically getting that three months of Game Pass Ultimate - which would ordinarily cost around £40 - as a freebie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Sony's newly-announced PlayStation 5 "Slim", which is set to launch in the US next month. 
Repeatedly leaked, the PS5 Slim's existence was not too much of a surprise, though word that its digital version would cost more in the US and that you now need to splash out £25 to stand the console upright still managed to raise some eyebrows. 
Rather than a proper mid-gen refresh, the Slim is more of a redesign - with no real incentive for existing PS5 owners to upgrade. Still, is a good resdesign? Does it position the console's digital edition as the PS5's main version? And most importantly, is standing your console vertical better? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

These attacks, which were verified by PC Gamer, only affected less than 100 Steam users, although NanoWar: Cells VS Virus (pictured above) developer Benoît Freslon recently revealed the hackers had taken control of his browser access tokens. This essentially gave the hackers access to any service Freslon had been logged into. 
"I just used my dev account to release the game few hours before the hack I suppose," he shared on X (formerly Twitter).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always find it difficult to pick out which demos are worth my limited time whenever Steam Next Fest rolls around again. The process is made a lot easier when I find something which promises the zen-like quality of PowerWash Simulator.
It may not seem like it at first, but somehow Crime Scene Cleaner manages to deliver on that promise. Despite the lack of cats and the abundance of dead bodies and blood.
You take on the role of a single dad who's a school caretaker (or janitor, seeing as the game takes place in the US) by day, and a mob cleanup crew by night. The mob pays much better than the regular day job, and we need the money to pay for our sick daughter's healthcare. Ah, the good old American healthcare system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go looks set to introduce the ability to party up, and explore alongside friends in-game. 


A teaser image posted on social media shows the silhouettes of four in-game avatars standing next to a gym with a raid egg, suggesting that four-player teams will be able to travel together and head as one into the game's PVE battles.


Pokémon Go developer Niantic captioned the image with a teasing eye emoji, an emoji wearing a party hat, and the hashtag #GoStartTheParty.

This is positive, as both Origins and Odyssey were far bigger and costlier projects, whereas Mirage is - by design - more focused.


2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla remains the biggest Assassin's Creed launch in the series to date.

The Fungle, as it is known, will be available across all platforms as part of a free update. It promises players the chance to immerse their Impostors and Crewmates in a "weird mushroom jungle". Are InnerSloth putting the fun in fungal? Well, we don't have long until we can find out, as this map launches in just a couple of weeks time, on 24th October.

Ever wonder how software gets deployed onto a system that is deliberately disconnected from the Internet and other networks? These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature. Sensitive as in utilities (power/water), banking, healthcare, weapons systems, other government use cases, etc. Sometimes it's technically a water gap, if you're running Kubernetes on an underwater vessel. Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.
Again, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments. Traditionally, software artifacts are physically carried across the air gap on hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, or flo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's looking increasingly likely Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard will have cleared its final hurdle if - as is widely expected - UK regulators approve the revised deal later this week; it's being reported EU regulators won't require an investigation into the revised terms, clearing the way for the acquisition to conclude.


The European Commission approved Microsoft's original acquisition proposal back in May after successfully securing a number of concessions to lessen the deal's potential impact on the emerging cloud gaming market. However, Microsoft was forced to submit a revised proposal after the deal was blocked by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority.


These revised terms - which will give Ubisoft exclusive control of streaming rights for Activision's titles outside of the EU - were provisionally approved by the CMA in September, and the regulator is expected to formally approve the deal this Friday, 13th October.

Fire up Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery, and you'll be able to play The Haunted Island - the 2018 adventure that started it all, wherein our sleuthing lead travels to exotic climes to solve the mystery of a sloth-bothering ghost - alongside its fairly self-explanatory 2019 sequel, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, and Frog Detective's final case, the wild-west-themed Corruption at Cowboy County, which released earlier this year.


These are not particularly lengthy games, each lasting an hour or two (Worm Club's official estimate for the whole Entire Mystery is "the four best hours of your life"), but Frog Detective's warm, silly demeanour still makes for a wonderfully entertaining time. And there's even a scooter in part three so, really, what's not to like?

Last week, YouTuber Volound issued a well-sourced report on Hyenas' downfall, including the detail that it had been Sega's "biggest budget game ever". That report stated Hyenas had been plagued with a lack of direction before it was ultimately canned.
Now, a further video by Volound has shared further quotes on Hyenas from anonymous sources who worked on its development. "I'm paralysed with a mixture of upset and anger over what's happening to my friends there," one person said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two months after PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers began receiving invites to a PlayStation 5 cloud streaming beta, Sony has announced the feature will be getting its full launch on on 23rd October in Europe and 30th October in the US.


Cloud streaming has been included with PlayStation Plus Premium membership since Sony's revised subscription service launched last year. However, it was previously restricted to streaming PS4 Game Catalogue titles and PS3 and PS2 games from the Classics Catalogue.


Starting this month, though, Premium subscribers can play PlayStation 5 Game Catalogue titles, PlayStation 5 Game Trials, and digital PlayStation 5 titles they've purchased (including associated DLC and in-game purchases) via cloud streaming on their PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team17 is poised to lay off up to 91 people - a third of the company - as part of its major restructuring programme, Eurogamer can reveal. 


The publisher of Worms, Dredge and Hell Let Loose confirmed it was planning to make redundancies earlier this month, after Eurogamer broke news that extensive cuts were being made to Team17's QA department in favour of outsourcing work elsewhere.


But the job losses go much further than those at risk in QA, Eurogamer understands, with staff across a wide range of departments affected - including those employed in Team17's marketing, usability, customer service, IT and HR teams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has called its recent The Lamplighters League a "big disappointment" from a commercial perspective, admitting - just seven days after its release - the pulp strategy game is unlikely to recoup its development costs, resulting in a $22.7m USD write-down.


The Lamplighters League, which was developed by the Paradox-owned Harebrained Schemes, blends tactical turn-based action and real-time stealth in a globe-trotting adventure inspired by the classic pulp stories of the 1930s, giving players control of a disparate group of rogues as they attempt to thwart an occult-obsessed cabal known as the Banished Court.


In truth, it's a deeply uneven experience; at its best, it's a "sublimely atmospheric, richly rewarding tactical adventure" - as I wrote in my 3 out of 5 stars review - but it's too often let down by bland maps, uninspiring mission objectives, and woefully underdeveloped real-time stealth. And it's clearly failed to capture the public's imagination too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has shared a new promo for upcoming release Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and it is really quite charming. 


The short video in question shows Bowser trying his best to woo Princess Peach with a single flower. She looks at him with a certain amount of scepticism, before both are distracted by the bouncy arrival of one of Super Mario Bros. Wonder's elephant power-ups. And, well, when one sees the opportunity to boost one's form into that of a trunk swinging, water spraying mammal, there really is only one thing for it. 


Soon, Peach has ingested (?) the elephantine delectable and is transformed before Bowser's very eyes. He is shocked to say the least, staring at his once demure princess with an open mouth and wide eyes. But, you know what? Our spikey boy is into it. Just when it may seem that Peach - in her enlarged and now tailed form - is about to blast Bowser back to his castle with a swift burst of water, he presents her with an even bigger bunch of flowers. It is a plot twist I wasn't expecting, and it is really rather sweet.

You see, it turns out this Lilith skin is only available through an Ultimate Battle Pass bundle, and that bundle doesn't exactly come cheap - it's £35/$40.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sony announced its "slim" models for the regular and digital editions of PlayStation 5, but not without some extra costs being introduced with the line.
For starters, both the regular and digital PS5 slim models will come with a hotizontal stand, but no base. A base is included in the box with the launch models, but if you want to stand the PS5 slim vertically, you'll need to buy a separate vertical stand (compatible with all PS5 models!) for £25, or $30. 
For buyers in North America, the slim model of the digital PS5 is more expensive than the launch model, costing $450 compared to $400, despite its smaller size. The slim PS5 with a disc drive will remain at the same price of $500.

The UK's national body for competitive video gaming said this collaboration aimed to set "new standards of excellence, education and innovation throughout the world of esports". This would include a variety of endeavours between the two parties, including internships, training programs and research projects.


However, British eSports has now acknowledged this news had sparked "concern" - no doubt fuelled by Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, which includes the criminalisation of homosexuality, fewer rights for women and the use of the death penalty. Saudi's Prince Mohammed bin Salman has also been blamed for assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by US intelligence agencies.


As a result, British eSports has released a statement addressing issues raised by the esports community.

But while Iger's advisors are suggesting that Disney do purchase a company such as EA, at the present time Iger is reportedly remaining "non committal" to the idea. So, do not expect to hear any big announcements in the near future.

Previously, Critical Strike Damage and Vulnerable Damage were calculated separately, meaning players could use skills with these attributes to pile on huge amounts of damage. 


Now, Critical Strike Damage will be capped at 50 percent and Vulnerable Damage at 20 percent as part of a "baseline multiplicative bonus" - bonus damage will be added together and multiplied by these percentages for each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft players have launched a petition demanding developer Mojang ends its annual mob vote - in which the community gets to vote on a new creature to be added to the game - saying the process 'leaves fantastic ideas on the cutting room floor' and only serves to highlight Minecraft's anaemic content release cycle.


Mojang has now revealed all three mobs that'll be put to the vote ahead of a grand results unveiling during this weekend's Minecraft Live - the crab, the penguin, and the armadillo - and it's a selection a newly launched fan petition describes as "three equally great options".


The petition, which at the time of writing has received 295K signatures from Minecraft fans in the three days since its launch, argues, "Mojang somehow releases less content WITH Microsoft's backing than they did without, [meaning] players see minimal content to the game they love". It continues that by "leaving fantastic ideas on the cutting room floor, and teasing content that will never be seen in the game", players must "watch as possibly the one thing to get them to play again is ripped from them".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocket League developer Psyonix has announced the game will no longer support player-to-player trading as of 5th December this year, as the studio moves to "align with Epic's overall approach to game cosmetics and item shop policies".


Trading was introduced to Rocket League in 2016, giving players the opportunity to exchange certain earned items, including cosmetics dropped at the end of matches and revealed blueprints (but not premium DLC), with other players and third-party trading sites.


From 4pm PST on 5th December this year, however, player-to-player trading will be removed from the game. Explaining the change in a post to its website, Psyonix - which was acquired by Epic Games in 2019 - insisted this would align Rocket League with Epic's "overall approach to game cosmetics and item shop policies, where items aren't tradable, transferrable, or sellable."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four years after its debut, developer Teyon's Terminator: Resistance is set to receive a Complete Edition on Xbox Series X/S - bundling together the base game and Annihilation Line DLC (which was previously unavailable on the console) for release on 27th October this year.


Terminator: Resistance originally released back in 2019, whisking players away to a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles - some 31 years after the events of Terminator: Judgment Day - for some first-person shooting action as they, in the role of resistance fighter Jacob Rivers, helped mount an assault against the Terminator menace.


Former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't too keen on the game when he reviewed it back in 2019, calling it "so generic that it has dissolved in my memory like a Skip on my tongue" - and that's despite Terminator: Resistance somehow managing to shoe-horn in two "inexplicably cringe" first-person sex scenes along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classic WW2 real-time stealth-tactics series Commandos is being revived for a sixth entry, Commandos: Origins, and it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.


Commandos, if you're unfamiliar, first made a splash back in 1998 with launch of developer Pyro Studios' first series entry, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines - which challenged players to guide a six-strong team of commandos, each with their own distinct abilities, behind enemy lines (the clue was very much in the title), to undertake the likes of sabotage and assassination missions while staying as sneaky as possible.


It's very good, if notoriously tough, and was followed by four more games: 1999's standalone expansion Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty, 2001's Commandos 2: Men of Courage (which introduced a 3D engine), 2003's Commandos 3: Destination Berlin, and 2006's Commandos: Strike Force - which re-imagined the series' formula in first-person.

The newly revealed console is said to mark a 30% decrease in volume compared to the previous PS5 model (and a weight reduction of 18% and 24% for the standard and digital edition respectively), and sports a design featuring two glossy panels on the top and two bottom panels that'll retain the matte look of the original machine.


The bottom left quadrant is where you'll find the new Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive attachment if you opt for the standard version of the machine. The digital-only version includes a removable panel that'll enable purchasers to add the drive - which costs an extra £99.99/€119.99/$79.99 USD - should they want a version capable of playing digital media at a later time.

The sets range from a small scene depicting a birthday party for villager Julian, made up of 170 pieces to a slightly larger 535-piece recreation of Nook's Cranny and Rosie's house. 
Other sets that will be available are Bunnie's Outdoor Activities, Kapp'n's Island Boat Tour, and Isabelle's House Visit.

And sadly for those eager to hear more, this is seemingly not something we should expect to hear any time in the near future. Instead, Meta is remaining remarkably tight-lipped about the project it once said was "many years in the making".
At this year's Connect conference, Meta was asked for more news on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' VR release by both UploadVR and Road to VR. However, the responses were less than informative.

In summer 2020, allegations of sexual assault and harassment were made against a number of senior and veteran employees including Assassin's Creed Valhalla creative director Ashraf Ismail, Splinter Cell and Far Cry creative director Maxime Béland, and former editorial vice president Tommy François.
Speaking at GamesIndustry HR Summit last month, Ubisoft's chief people officer Annika Grant said the company is now "on the right path" following a number of changes implemented internally, as reported by GamesIndustry. Grant joined Ubisoft in 2021 when it was "navigating a misconduct crisis".

<blockquote><p>Polynomial Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Billions of dollars and countless GPU hours are currently spent on training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for a variety of tasks. Thus, it is essential to determine the difficulty of extracting all the parameters of such neural networks when given access to their black-box implementations. Many versions of this problem have been studied over the last 30 years, and the best current attack on ReLU-based deep neural networks was presented at Crypto&#8217;20 by Carlini, Jagielski, and Mironov. It resembles a differential chosen plaintext attack on a cryptosystem, which has a secret key embedded in its black-box implementation and requires a polynomial number of queries but an exponential amount of time (as a function of the number of neurons)...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

But while those inclusions expanded the map, there were some omissions as well. Most obviously, just where did all of that Sheikah tech, that was so instrumental to Breath of the Wild's story, go? And what happened to those spidery robot Guardians?


Well, according to Zelda director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, the various towers, Guardians, Divine Beasts and other Sheikah creations simply disappeared, with the general consensus in Hyrule being that as their purpose had been realised, the tech knew it was its time to go.

Jack Skellington from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is also joining Fortnite - I like that he also has his Santa Jack costume as well - alongside Halloween's Michael Myers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With all signs pointing to an imminent successful end for Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition saga, Activision has moved to address the issue of its titles appearing on Game Pass, saying not to expect that to happen until next year if the deal goes through.


To date, Activision titles have been notably absent from Game Pass, but the assumption has been that would change if Microsoft's $69bn bid for the Call of Duty publisher succeeded. And with the deal now anticipated to be finalised this week, assuming the UK's Competition and Markets Authority gives it the green light as is generally expected, questions around an Activision presence on Game Pass have shifted from 'if' to 'when'.


And the company has now addressed fan queries on social media, writing, "As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we've been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has announced the departure of its CEO John Riccitiello, just weeks after the company became mired in controversy following hugely unpopular changes to its engine pricing model.


At the end of last month, Unity announced sweeping changes to its Unity Engine business model that would force developers to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee every time their game was installed, on top of their existing licence subscription, after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash from the development community was immediate and intense, and Unity eventually announced significant changes to its initial plans - but by that point, the damage was done.


And now Unity has announced that John Riccitiello, the CEO who oversaw its reputationally devastating pricing changes, "will retire" from all his roles at the company - president, chief executive officer, chairman, and a member of its board of directors - effective immediately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam's Next Fest has returned for another week-long showcase of future releases, including developer livestreams, chats, and, of course, "hundreds" of playable demos.


Valve's latest Steam Next Fest is already underway and runs until 5.59pm BST/9.59am PST on Monday, 16th October. That means you've got just under seven full days at the time of writing to furiously claw your way through another bumper crop of playable demos before they potentially vanish once more into the ether.


We're well beyond the days when you could feasibly work your way through the entire list before the end of Next Fest (unless you're particularly determined and hate sleep, I suppose), but Valve has, at least, assembled a special event mini-site, splitting available demos down into mere easily perusable and digestible categories.

That's compared to the 10.3m players that hopped into last year's FIFA 23 during the same period - a figure EA referred to as "record-breaking" and the "biggest launch period" in the franchise's history at the time.


EA Sports FC 24's 11.3m players would certainly suggest the series' success hasn't been hampered by the loss of the FIFA brand, then, but EA does note this year's figures include EA Play subscribers, so those numbers don't necessarily all equate to sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's new Assassin's Creed entry is all about stealth and subtlety, but main character Basim still gets a ridiculous special move. 


It's called Assassin's Focus, and it allows you to freeze time and paint a reticule over multiple enemies to teleport between them all and murder them in quick succession. It's like Red Dead Redemption's Quickdraw mode, except you're physically knifing people in the neck with every bullet.


At the beginning of Assassin's Creed Mirage, you can only pull off this effect with two enemies at a time, but with further upgrades you're able to expand this effect to quickly end a whole group of foes at once.

Hero Pass was described by Jagex as an "always-on reward system" and it was introduced into RuneScape last month. It was heavily criticised by players for pay-to-win elements such as XP buffs, which prompted Jagex to temporarily roll back the update shortly after Hero Pass launched.
Following feedback from a player survey, Jagex announced Hero Pass will end once the current season, Underworld, finishes on 4th December.

Gollum released in a rather sorry state in May earlier this year, and was heavily criticised for a lack of polish and technical issues. A statement attributed to Daedalic Entertainment and released on its social media one day after release apologised for the game's quality and stated the studio's commitment to improving the game with patches.
The report from German outlet Game Two was created after interviewing 32 former and current employees at Daedalic, as well as receiving statements from the company itself, on the development of Gollum.

Created by Delca, who is also working on a Tomb Raider Legend demake, this side-scrolling adventure sees Lara making her way around the likes of Venice, the Great Wall of China and, of course, Croft Manor as she searches for the Dagger of Xian. However, this time she can only travel backwards and forwards.


It is a rather incredible recreation, and one that clearly has a lot of love attached to it. As I said in my headline, it is a brilliant tribute to a brilliant game.

<p>The reality, unfortunately, is quite different.

The game's visual chromatic aberration effect is switched on by default and there's no way to turn it off - despite it being pronounced and sometimes quite distracting in certain areas. 


One of the first things I did when starting to play Mirage was look for some kind of slider or toggle to tune the effect (or just disable it completely). Alas, one does not exist.

One of the most missable companions is Minthara, who appears in Act 1 of the game. In normal circumstances, recruiting her means siding with the goblins and attacking Emerald Grove along with the refugee Tieflings that are staying there.
However, this comes with some significant consequences - Halsin will refuse to help you later on in the game, and Karlach will be unavailable as a companion. Unless you're Taiwanese player pao870111, who came up with a way to recruit Minthara in a morally good playthrough without the use of mods.

Even more amazingly still, the cat isn't even a work of fiction created by the dev team. It turns out that a fan shared an image of the sweet kitty after he "recently crossed the rainbow bridge" and after bringing him to the attention of the team and offering "coffee and Timbits" to any dev prepared to immortalise the cat in the game, it seems Ubisoft did precisely that.

"Am I reaching at straws here or?" asked suckashelfboi101 on the game's subreddit, seeking assurances that they weren't just seeing things. "Is this cats face supposed to look like the Assassin Emblem or what because it’s all I can see. Maybe something the devs put in for fun?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Talos Principle 2 is inviting you to try before you buy courtesy of a new Steam Next Fest demo.

Described as a "standalone" demo, players can get an early "bespoke" taste of the sequel's "bold new world" through a series of hand-picked puzzles spread across "stunning new locations, as well as a glimpse into the vast narrative that awaits them".

As Matt recently summarised for us, the original Talos Principle served up an often fiendishly cerebral bout of puzzle-solving with lasers, time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophy. Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle "rooms" that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress through the game.

The union was formed after CDPR announced a third wave of job cuts in as many months, driving developers to unionise as a means of "improving their workplace/industry standards in a way that has legal power and amplifies their voices".

"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when nine per cent of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go," the union explains on the Gamedevunion.pl website (as translated by Google Translate).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we creak ever closer to spooky season and a possible second Silent Hill Transmission – the last was just before Halloween 2022 – it seems Bloober Team has quietly been updating the backend of Silent Hill 2 Remake's Steam page.

In fairness, the store description and its accompanying tags have been tweaked routinely throughout the year, but according to Steam DB, there's been a flurry of activity through September and now October, including confirmation of language subtitles (Brazillian, Portuguese, and Ukrainian), tags, and Steam achievements, hinting that the in-game achievements have been finalised and signed off. The store assets and images have also been refreshed, too.

Concrete proof that an update or release is imminent? Hardly. But it's one of the strongest signals yet that development has entered the final straight, and the "coming soon" on the game's Steam page is accurate. Here's hoping we'll get a long-overdue update from Konami in the next week or so.

This means that the original "fall (Q3) 2023" window has now been pushed back to spring (Q2) 2024.

Hints that an expanded version of The Last of Us Part 2 is in development at Naughty Dog first surfaced back in July, when the game's composer, Gustavo Santaolalla, referenced a "new edition" that would enable players to interact with his banjo-playing cameo in the town of Jackson, selecting from a number of songs he can play.


Santaolalla wouldn't share any more details beyond that, leaving fans to ponder exactly what sort of "new version" he might be referring to, but now, thanks to a now-removed update on the LinkedIn profile of Naughty Dog's lead outsource artist Mark Pajarillo (as spotted by over on Resetera), we might finally have a clearer idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five months after release, Arkane Studios' beleaguered vampire shooter Redfall has received its long-promised 60fps mode on Xbox Series X/S, as part of a major patch that also brings improved performance on PC, stealth takedowns, increased enemy counts, and more.


A 60fps mode for Redfall was first touted back in April, after publisher Bethesda broke the news its game would be locked to 1440p and 30fps on both Xbox Series X and S at launch. At the time, the studio said a 60fps "performance mode" would be added at some point after release - although it's doubtful many were expecting it to take five moths to arrive.


Redfall's performance mode comes as part of a substantial update for Xbox Series X/S and PC touching on everything from gameplay and performance to accessibility. Patch notes promise "improved PC performance and stability across a wide range of hardware configurations", for instance, alongside fixes for memory crashes and graphical corruption on AMD GPUs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life may be full of regrets, but if one of those regrets is that you decided to call your Baldur's Gate 3 character Bumfart the Third in a moment of weakness, there's some good news: the game's latest hotfix will finally let you change their ill-conceived name.


That's the headline feature for Baldur's Gate 3's Hotfix #9 (or at least it is if you're a remorseful Bumfart), but there's more where that came from. The Magic Mirror, for instance, will - as well as enabling the aforementioned renaming unshaming - allow you to customise your hirelings if their outward appearance isn't to your liking.


Developer Larian notes the same restrictions apply to hirelings that apply when changing the appearance of the player character - presumably meaning you can give them a full aesthetic makeover to suit your dubious whims but you're stuck with their original race, sub race, and any cosmetic modifications resulting from gameplay.

Dave the Diver's previous big update, which released in August, was predominantly focused on quality of life improvements, and while there're plenty more of those stuffed into October's update, we get a bunch of new content too.


The glacier area, for instance - which primarily exists as a story-focused location with fewer missions compared to its counterparts right now - will receive new quests. Additionally, the ocean is set to welcome new species - crabs and lobsters - both requiring players to use special traps to catch. Oh, and a lobster party event will be added to coincide with their arrival.

For those of you wondering, a full team in Redfall multiplayer is made up of four players. Over the past week, Redfall's concurrent Steam player count dropped to a low of three, as recorded by SteamDB. Its peak during that same period of time is 38.
Redfall's launch didn't go as parent company Microsoft had hoped, as Phil Spencer revealed the company had expected the game to review much higher than it did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have a release date for American Arcadia: 15th November on PC (via Steam). So, if you are anything like me and rather looking forward to this release, thankfully there is not too much longer to wait. 


If you are unsure of what American Arcadia is all about, I will give you a little overview. It is by Out of the Blue, the same studio that gave us 2020's rather special Call of the Sea, and set in the "retro-futuristic '70 metropolis" Arcadia.


On the outside, Arcadia seems to promise its residents a life of cushy luxury, but all is not what it seems. In fact, the Arcadia residents are all part of a TV show, and they have no idea they are being recorded for the entertainment of the wider public (think The Truman Show). But, it is not all as innocent as that (not that that is especially innocent, really). You see, if the viewers don't like someone, well, it could end in their death. And this is something that our poor everyday man Trevor Hills is trying to avoid.

And, with season two just around the corner, we thought it would be a good idea to let you know how to ensure you don't lose your stash as well as your character. 


When Diablo 4's current season - Season of the Malignant - comes to an end, players will see their seasonal characters moved over to the Eternal Realm with all their items - but there's a time limit to recover them. 


Items will be found in your stash in a new  "Withdraw Only Stash tab". But don't get complacent, as they won't stay here forever. If you want to withdraw any of your items from this chest, you will need to make sure you do so before Diablo 4's second season comes to a close. Otherwise, they will become "unrecoverable".

The CMA has until 18th October to weigh in with its final decision, following a deadline today for feedback on the deal's revised form - now Microsoft has agreed to sell off streaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft.

Now, another rock has made its way onto that already bumpy road, with developer Starbreeze announcing it has chosen to delay its upcoming patch. 


This patch was initially meant to be released yesterday, 5th October, and address "200+ QoL-improvements for all platforms". However, the developer has pushed it back until an unspecified time in mid-October. This, the Payday 3 team has said, is to "ensure its stability".


"The patch needs some changes that would require us to go through console certification again," Starbreeze explained. In a follow up post, the team confirmed that this will mean the game's "PS5 bonus content will remain unredeemable until this patch is ready".

Layoffs are nothing new, of course, but this year in particular feels like a particularly tough time, at companies big and small. From tech giants such as Microsoft and Epic Games down to development studios such as Telltale Games, the bad news just keeps on coming. 
We discussed the job losses at Creative Assembly last week following the cancellation of Hyenas. Since then, we've heard of deep cuts at Team17, and more job losses on Dragon Age. We consider these examples and more, and consider whether each is part of a wider pattern, or a more individual example. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale Games, the resurrected studio behind the likes of The Expanse: A Telltale Series and the upcoming The Wolf Among Us 2, has confirmed layoffs at the studio, after a former employee shared a message on social media claiming "most of" his team had been let go last month.


News of layoffs at Telltale began circulating after cinematic artist Jonah Huang - who's worked at the studio in both its current and original incarnation, which closed down in 2018 - claimed the studio "laid most of us off early September".


Huang also appeared to imply further troubles for The Wolf Among Us 2 - which was originally due to release this year before Telltale pushed it back into 2024 to avoid burnout and crunch - saying he couldn't comment on the status of its development due to a binding NDA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like forever ago that For the King 2 - the sequel to IronOak Games' wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure - was announced (it was actually about 18 months ago, it turns out), but it finally has a release date and is coming to Steam on 2nd November.


For the King 2, which is set some 20 years after the events of the first game, promises another bout of optionally co-operative rogue-like adventuring - this time for up to four pals both locally and online - as players take on the kingdom of Fahrul's tyrannical queen. 


Everything shown so far suggests the sequel is more about refinement than radical reinvention, meaning you should expect the same blend of familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - with some neat story generation through and randomised narrative events, only this time with a few notable tweaks.

As reported by IGN, former Bungie HR manager Ingrid Alm - who joined the studio in May 2022 - filed a complaint in the state of Washington earlier this year, citing retaliation and wrongful termination. Alm alleges she was fired from Bungie after being asked to investigate a Black employee, referred to as "James Smith" in court documents, who responded by saying he felt he was being racially targeted by his supervisor.


As a result, Alm recommended Smith's supervisor receive diversity training, but says her suggestion was met with "hostility and denial" - it's claimed she was told the supervisor had "been there for a long time" and was "highly regarded" - and her recommendation was denied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a week after announcing it was delaying fishing horror Dredge's first paid expansion, The Iron Rig, into 2024, developer Black Salt Games has unveiled an entirely different paid expansion, The Pale Reach, which arrives on 16th November.


The Pale Reach plots a course for a "new, frozen frontier", where players will need to navigate treacherous icy canyons - soon also likely to succumb to the malevolence seen elsewhere in the game - following the trail of a long-forgotten expedition to see what became of its crew.


It's a trip that'll first require players to equip their boat with specialised gear capable of smashing through the ice, and once the voyage is underway, there'll be new story content, 11 new fish and crab species (as well as their aberrated counterparts), a new fish type, plus new achievements and trophies. Black Salt Games also teases a new item that'll extend "the freshness of catches no matter where you're fishing", over on the PlayStation Blog.

Following its recently released Phantom Liberty expansion and the base game's extensive 2.0 update, developer CD Projekt Red has announced a partnership with Anonymous Content to develop a brand-new, live-action story set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077. I wonder if they will bring Idris Elba and Keanu Reeves back for the occasion?


This live-action project is still in the very early stages of development, with the studios involved still on the hunt for a screenwriter to take the lead.


While the search continues, several members from media company Anonymous Content have been confirmed to be on board. Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, and Bard Dorros will all be part of this project's production, which CDPR said will be developed in "close collaboration" with Cyberpunk 2077's creative team.

Pokétsume has been made in collaboration with The Pokémon Company, and stars actress and former girl group member Nishino Nanase as Madoka Akagi, an adult who finds out the working world is not how she dreamt it would be. Her mother sends her her old Game Boy and Pokémon Red cartridge, and she decides to start playing Pokémon again.
As she carries on playing Pokémon Red, Madoka begins to find the same energy as her game character to work through her hardships in real life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Rockstar quietly added a 60fps toggle to Red Dead Redemption on PlayStation 5. The game, which was released back in August for both PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, can be played on PS5 thanks to backwards compatibility. And now, that little toggle gives PlayStation 5 users a new framerate to play around with while exploring the Wild West. 


However, there are some Xbox Series X/S players who are now feeling rather left out by Rockstar, asking where their 60fps Red Dead Redemption port is.


When Rockstar brought Red Dead Redemption to PlayStation 4 and Switch, it directed its Xbox community to the original 360 version of the game. As Digital Foundry noted earlier this year, the Xbox Series X and One X versions of Red Dead Redemption are running on the 360 code, with a higher resolution, anisotropic filtering, and a negative LOD bias to enhance texture mip-maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mobile developer Hutch Games has corrected store listings for two of its free-to-play games following complaints filed with the UK Advertising Standards Authority, and described its omission of explicit disclosure of loot boxes a "mistake".
The complaints were made by researcher Leon Y. Xiao, who has conducted studies on the effectiveness of Belgium's loot box ban and the consistency of loot box warnings on games.  
Xiao filed complaints regarding Hutch Games for Rebel Racing on the Google Play Store and F1 Clash - Car Racing Manager on the Apple App Store, and said that both games failed to mention the presence of loot boxes. Current ASA guidance states advertising must make it clear if loot boxes exist in a game, with a notification on store pages at a minimum.

A social media post showing the back of the Complete Edition's box reveals that the physical copy of the game will be shipped on two blu-ray discs. Users will need to ensure they have plenty of free space before cracking on with Aloy's latest outings, as a minimum of 121GB is required for installation.


While Aloy's escapades across America will be the first game to release across two discs on PlayStation 5, it won't be the only title to do so. Earlier this year, Square Enix revealed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will also be on two discs. This game is set to release next year.

50 staff were let go in August, as part of a move the company said would make the studio "more agile and more focused". Several veteran team members were included in the cuts, including two writers who had each worked at the studio for over 20 years. 


Now, a group of seven people - with an average of 14 years at BioWare between them - have requested further compensation from the company, with a payout calculated to take their years of service into consideration.

Presenting Elephant Mario 64, a combination of work between a group of modders, known as SM64ex-coop, to add Elephant Mario to Super Mario 64. He's fully playable, minus any Elephant form abilities, and is complete with a tiny tail sticking out from his overalls.
The model was made by modder Koop the Koopa, with some alterations from YouTuber Unreal (no, not that one) to allow for colour customisation. The bottom of Elephant Mario's feet are pink and can't be changed due to how the model is structured, Unreal notes, but I rather like it. It makes it look like he's got a bunch of toe beans on his soles.

YouTube channel Volound shared an eye-opening video on the recent cancellation, with claims from anonymous developers detailing a "total lack of direction" around the game, with one contributor stating many members of the leadership team were "asleep at the wheel but they never seemed to lose their jobs". The same source noted an engine change and "not committing to doing anything adventurous with the game" were all part of Hyenas' ultimate demise. 


Another contributor said that internal feedback on the game was poor, adding it was felt that Hyenas would "melt into the background of an already saturated multiplayer shooter market". These claims have since also been corroborated by VGC.

These ex-employees included the company's now-disgraced chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, once the right-hand man to Ubisoft's overall boss Yves Guillemot, as well as its former editoral boss Tommy François, French newspaper Libération reported today.


The five ex-Ubisoft employees were reportedly picked up by police over the past 24 hours and questioned at a police station in Paris. The action comes three years after claims of sexual misconduct involving Hascoët, François and others came to light, as part of a wave of allegations that rocked Ubisoft in the summer of 2020. Both Hascoët and François departed the company shortly afterwards.

That forest screenshot also shows the character shooting at a leafy creature with a bow and arrow, suggestive of the increased combat focus compared with Stardew.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's launch, Nintendo released a quietly devastating trailer for its game that showed a real life, 'everyday' man going about his business in a rather subdued manner. 


Even his home life seemed to have become mundane, with him and his wife only really seeing each other briefly after a long day in the office, before she popped off to bed. Well, thank goodness for Zelda, as not only did Tears of the Kingdom give a welcome boost to our suffering man's evening, it now seems that it has also improved his marriage. 


In a new trailer, we are once again reunited with Nintendo's sad man and his wife, and once again, he is playing Zelda. But, oh! He seems to be having a bit of trouble with one of the game's many shrines. His partner looks over, and gives some sage advice. "Ah, that's how it's done," he seems to think, while throwing her an adoring smile (honestly, it is so pure and lovely, and kind of the way my dog looks at food).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced it is ending online play services for both the 3DS and Wii U. These services will be terminated "as of early April 2024," the company wrote in an update earlier today. 


Nintendo has been steadily winding down its support for these older consoles, having sunsetted the eShop for both platforms last year. Of course, this had no effect on the online play capabilities of the games. 


However, as of April next year, games on either the Wii U or 3DS will only be playable offline. This means "online cooperative play, internet rankings and data distribution" will also be affected. It also means no more online town hopping in Animal Crossing: New Leaf (pictured above).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's MineCon Live - developer Mojang's annual celebration of all things Minecraft - is right around the corner, and ahead of the big day on 15th October, the studio is holding its yearly mob vote, with choice number one having now been revealed as the crab.


Minecraft's annual mob vote, if you're unfamiliar, gives players the chance to collectively decide on the creature they'd like to see added to the blockbusting survival sandbox next. Previously mob votes have resulted in the likes of the Glow Squid, Panda, Phantom, Llama, and Sniffer all ending up in-game, and the crab is now vying for a place in that illustrious line-up.


As per Mojang's animated video introducing the crab, should voters shunt the little fella into first place, it'll be found within the mangrove swamp biome. We're also told about its crab claw, which, once acquired, will enable players to place blocks further away than would normally be possible - a bit of a builder-focused utility, then, this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 18 months after its initial unveiling, Blizzard's free-to-play strategy game Warcraft Rumble has a release date and will be launching for iOS and Android on 3rd November, its arrival coinciding with the start of this year's BlizzCon.


Warcraft Rumble - formerly known as Warcraft Arclight Rumble - promises a blend of strategy and tower defense across a its 70-mission single-player campaign, which features some familiar heroes and villains from the Warcraft universe, including Warsong chieftain Grommash Hellscream and Archmage Jaina Proudmoore.


In order to tackle Rumbles' various scenarios, players must assemble an army, choosing leaders, troops, and spells from the game's 65+ collectible character Minis, each of which has its own distinctive "talents" for use in battle. These also come into play across Rumble's other modes and features, including co-op, PvP, guilds, raids, and dungeons.

Carter describes Moonring as a "retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games" - albeit one "created from the ground up with modern design sensibilities" - and it all plays out across the mysterious land of Caldera, a place of "Devotion and Dreamers, Gods and Gifts", where players take on the role of Dreamless.


"Travel, trade, sneak, fight and sail the world of Caldera," teases Moonring's Steam page. "Speak with the townsfolk, learn Caldera's secrets, and challenge the Archon for his throne... or even overthrow the Gods themselves!".

The controller is inspired by the official Shadow range of controllers released during the lifetime of the Xbox One. It has a gold-to-black metallic finish on the front, creating an illusion of a shadow cast at the bottom of the grips, while the rest of the controller is carbon black.

The gold metallic finish extends to the D-pad. There are rubberised diamond-pattern side grips, unlike your bog standard Xbox controller.

Gotham Knights got a mixed response from our Chris Donlan upon its release last year. He called it a "slight muddle of a game", but noted it still "has its pleasures" in Eurogamer's review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic has announced it's introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it calls its evolution into a "multi-game ecosystem".


Third-party developed content in Fortnite has become an increasing focus for Epic in recent times, and the company introduced its Unreal Editor for Fortnite tools - also known as Creative 2.0 - back in March. These enable creators to bring fully fledged Unreal Editor experiences into Fortnite, complete with custom assets, animations, audio, and advanced VFX effects, in a bid to turn the game into a creator-led platform closer to the likes of Roblox.


And now, as its "multi-game ecosystem" ambitions grow, Epic has announced it'll be making age ratings mandatory for all first- and third-party playable experiences in Fortnite as of 14th November this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a PlayStation 5 bundle which includes Marvel's Spider-Man 2. 


This bundle is set to release alongside the game on 20th October. As with earlier bundles for the likes of God of War: Ragnarök and Horizon Forbidden West, it will come with the standard PS5 console and a voucher to download a copy of the game.


While Sony hasn't officially released a price for this upcoming deal, according to Kotaku the bundle will cost $560 (so around £465), offering a small saving on buying the console and game separately. This is also cheaper than the previously announced Marvel's Spider-Man 2 limited edition bundle, which includes themed-hardware. That deal will set you back £569.99.

This patch addresses a range of issues across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including general fixes and character specific adjustments. However, the Nintendo Switch version of the game remains left out in the cold, at least for now, despite Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon previously promising fixes.


Sharing the patch notes online, Boon said the team will "kontinue to listen" and keep "lines of communication open" as it continues to improve its game (I just wish Boon would be a little more konsistent with his use of Ks).

However, a post on the official Batman Arkham Twitter account said the team has made the decision to delay the launch to ensure Switch users get the "best possible experience" on release.

The pigeon dating sim was an amateur project made by Moa and it was released in 2011 in Japanese. The game gained popularity following fan translations into English, and a HD remake was developed by Mediatonic. Hatoful Boyfriend HD was published in 2014 by Devolver Digital. 

Mediatonic was acquired by Epic in 2021. Last week, Mao stated they have received "no royalty payment" since the acquisition and voiced their frustration on Twitter.

The Elite Season Opener Pack costs 285,000 coins (the in-game currency) or 3000 FC Points (premium currency) and seemingly includes such powerful cards that players are accusing EA of pay-to-win tactics.

I'm talking about, of course, His Majesty the cat. Formerly a sphynx cat, he was changed into a different breed to differentiate him between another bald cat encountered later on in the story.

I've been slowly chugging through Baldur's Gate 3 and two months after its release on PC, I finally reached Act Two this weekend. Upon meeting His Majesty for the first time last night, my initial reaction was "ah, this is the bald cat everyone was upset about," and I can understand why. With the hair, he just doesn't command the same respect.

The developer recently released a new image for GTA Online's Moon Festival, which you can see above. This image was shared as part of a blog post about GTA Online which - on the surface at least - was all fairly standard stuff.


But it's the Moon Festival image which is getting attention - as some fans believe Rockstar is actually teasing the series' next entry in this seemingly straightforward picture.

Pioneers of Pagonia was revealed back in February, promising a city building adventure set across the mysterious islands of Pagonia, where players must work to steadily increase their reach and influence among the islands' many (not always friendly) inhabitants through resource gathering, production, economic expansion, and exploration.


When Pioneers of Pagonia enters early access in December, only some of its final features will be available, including procedural map generation, over 40 different building types, plus more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. The likes of co-op play, new buildings, new production chains, and other improvements are expected to arrive in the six months or so of development planned ahead of a full 1.0 release.

Galyonkin's career in the games industry spans more than two decades but he gained renown after establishing Steam Spy in 2015, a project he continued to run after joining Epic as Eastern European head of publishng in 2016. A year later, Galyonkin became the company's director of publishing strategy, with a specific focus on Epic's store, and he's remained in that role since. 


Now, though, Galyonkin has revealed his time at the company is over. "Today is officially my last day at Epic Games," he wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. "These eight years have been some of the most exciting in my career, and I am deeply grateful to my former Epic Games colleagues and Tim Sweeney for allowing me to help build Epic 4.0."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six games are set to leave Xbox Game Pass in the next two weeks, including Trek to Yomi. 


Want to know more about Trek to Yomi? Well, let me quickly samurai-se it for you. In Trek to Yomi, which is set in Japan during the Edo period, players take on the role of a young warrior named Hiroki. Hiroki will have to face the "forces of evil" as he tries to make amends for failing to protect his village from a brutal onslaught.


The Black-and-white samurai curio is set to leave the service on 16th October, so if you were interested in taking up your sword and having a go for yourself, but hadn't managed to get round to it yet, this is a little reminder to snap it up while you can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports FC 24 is the second-biggest boxed game launch of 2023 here in the UK, though physical sales are down by 30 percent on last year's FIFA 23.


The rebranded FIFA bumped boxed game juggernaut Hogwarts Legacy into third place in terms of the biggest 2023 UK physical game launches. Only The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold more. 


While boxed sales are declining across the board, annual mass market titans FIFA and Call of Duty have held onto a sizable - if shrinking - slice of physical sales. A further drop in boxed numbers this year was somewhat inevitable, though a 30 percent fall is something of a jump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new bug has been discovered in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet which causes the game to crash during the last battle of its main story questline.

The bug appears to have been introduced with patch 2.0.1, which rolled out alongside the DLC The Teal Mask on 13th September.

Players have identified what triggers the game to crash and work-arounds whilst the bug persists. Here's the short version - if you have already registered the Legendary Paradox Pokémon which is native to your version of the game, don't try to swap Pokémon in slots four to six of your party into battle. Light spoilers below for the long version.

The exhibit at the museum in Amsterdam consists of six paintings of Pokémon in the style of Van Gogh, accompanied by a range of exclusive merchandise and a special Pikachu trading card. Sadly, footage of the exhibit's opening day, showed visitors hurriedly grabbing whatever merch they could to resell.

The merch was also available to buy on Pokémon Center webstores, though it quickly sold out. The items appear to have been prevented from appearing when searching on the UK Pokémon Center website, though the pages can still be found through search engines.
