        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bokeh Game Studio has given us a fresh look at its upcoming horror-but-not-too-horror game, Slitterhead.

In an all-new developer diary posted to YouTube (see below), Bokeh revealed new details about its inaugural title, including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities, and – surprise! – the ability to play as a dog.

Given "early development footage" is stamped across all snippets of gameplay and most of the action comes from early tests, it's safe to presume that development has moved on since this footage was captured, but nonetheless, it provides a tantalising glimpse at what's in store.

<blockquote><p>A mysterious squid-like cosmic cloud, this nebula is very faint, but also very large in planet Earth&#8217;s sky. In the image, composed with 30 hours of narrowband image data, it spans nearly three full moons toward the royal constellation Cepheus. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula&#8217;s bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue-green emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, a more recent investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

This is Alaska&#8217;s Permanent Fund, funded by the state&#8217;s oil revenues and paid to every Alaskan each year. We&#8217;re now in a different sort of resource rush, with companies peddling bits instead of oil: generative AI.</p>
<p>Everyone is talking about these new AI technologies&#8212;like ChatGPT&#8212;and AI companies are touting their awesome power. But they aren&#8217;t talking about how that power comes from all of us. Without all of our writings and photos that AI companies are using to train their models, they would have nothing to sell. Big Tech companies are currently taking the work of the American people, without our knowledge and consent, without licensing it, and are pocketing the proceeds...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released a new trailer for Pikmin 4, ahead of its release in a couple of weeks.

The video is a short primer on what the titular Pikmin are and how they can be used in-game. The overview follows a new traveller as they meet the Pikmin and learn how to work with them.

The traveller looks on in confusion at various points, before a Pikmin confidently approaches them and instructs them to blow their whistle, or launch it towards a task to do, which got a chuckle out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yuji Naka, Sonic's co-creator and the man behind ill-fated platformer Balan Wonderworld, has been found guilty of insider trading, but will avoid prison for now.


Naka was first arrested back in November 2022 following reports of alleged insider trading at Square Enix. He pleaded guilty in March, and then, in June, the developer was sentenced to serve two and a half years in jail, with a final judgement in July.


At this time, Naka was additionally fined twice for ¥2.5m and ¥170m (just under £1m total), with his defence seeking a suspended sentence and to lower the fines. They claimed Naka "accidentally saw information that was extremely unrelated to [his] work". However, prosecutors said Naka "showed no signs of remorse" for his actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4's first season will go live on 20th July, with the promise of a new boss battle, questline and gear to get your hands on. 


Known as Season of the Malignant, this season will introduce the fittingly named Malignant Monsters. These monsters are described by Blizzard as "decaying abominations" that roam through Sanctuary in a frenzy. They will not hesitate to attack anyone or anything that gets in their way. 


A new questline will focus on sorting these new foes out, with Cormond, a former priest of the Cathedral of Light, helping you on your way. He will train you to "capture the Malignant hearts" that are the source of the monsters' power, and "convert them into build-altering powers".

Not including today's announcements, NetherRealm has so-far confirmed a total of 10 playable characters for Mortal Kombat 1: Johnny Cage, Kenshi, Kitana, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Mileena, Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung (available via pre-order), and Sub-Zero.


Two more additions have now been revealed as part of NetherRealm's latest Kombat Kast livestream. Assassin-turned-cyborg Smoke is in, marking his first playable appearance in the main series since 2011's Mortal Kombat reboot. He's joined by moody demi-god Rain, who hasn't been benched quite so long, having appeared in Mortal Kombat 11 as a DLC character.

Speaking to GameReactor at the recent Gamelab conference in Barcelona, Molyneux was reluctant to give many firm details of the game or this idea to avoid - in his words - people subsequently getting "very annoyed and angry" when their expectations of Molyneux's words are met with reality.


"In days gone by, I would just start telling you about the whole game and the whole game design and why it was going to be the most brilliant game in the world," Molyneux said. "I'm not going to do that."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol has joined PlayStation Plus Premium's ever-expanding trials programme - good news indeed for those yet to try the space horror game.


You can now play the game for one hour, which will give you a little taster of what's in store for protagonist Jacob Lee as he negotiates the perils of the galactic prison facility he finds himself in on Jovian moon Callisto.


It is a shorter trial than previous PlayStation Plus offerings, with the likes of God of War Ragnarök giving players three hours of gameplay, but still a nice addition to the service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashback, the classic 16-bit sci-fi platformer from Delphine Software, is, as you probably already know, getting a sequel before the end of 2023, some 31 years after its original release. And new developer Microids has now offered a fresh look at Flashback 2's action - specifically the jungle-y bits - in a new trailer as it prepares for a November release.


The original Flashback, which arrived to much acclaim back in 1992 - when everything was still in black and white, and computers were powered by magic - followed the far-flung future adventures of agent Conrad B. Hart on the trail of shapeshifting aliens attempting to infiltrate human society. It was an investigation that, much like Delphine's earlier Another World, took the form of a strikingly rotoscoped platform-puzzler.


Flashback 2 (which, somewhat confusingly, isn't technically the game's first sequel, given the existence of 1995's 3D follow-up Fade to Black) sees Conrad B. Hart return for more sci-fi adventure - somewhere in the 22nd century - as he goes in search of his friend Ian. Again.

Gun announced an end for Friday the 13th: The Game back in June, confirming the asymmetrical multiplayer horror would be pulled from stores on 31st December this year, the same day its Friday the 13th licence officially expires. There's some small solace for owners, however, in that the studio has promised the game will remain playable through "at least" 31st December 2024.


And now, it's announced some new measures that, while primarily designed to "reduce the dependence on database servers", will also allow players to go about their merry slaughtering and killer-evading survival in chaotically maxed-out fashion.

And now, thanks to a new leak, we've got a good idea of when EA Sports FC will likley be showing up - which, unsurprisingly, is pretty much slap bang in the same late-September slot FIFA has occupied for the last few years.


According to data miner billbil-kun - who has a amassed a pretty compelling back catalogue of accurate calls when it comes to video game leaks (Sony's monthly PlayStation Plus line-up being a particular specialty) - EA Sports FC will release on 29th September this year.


Given that FIFA 2023 and the series entry before it both launched on 27th September in their respective release years, it's hardly a huge surprise to learn EA's new FIFA-in-all-but-name game will follow suit, but it does give us an intriguing window to watch as we prepare to see how EA Sports FC will fair without its familiar branding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage will include an interactive history feature available in the game at launch, allowing you to delve deeper into the real world version of the game's Baghdad setting. 


This option appears to be an alternative to the more involved Discovery Tour mode that popped up some time post-launch in Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. Perhaps befitting Mirage's more condensed nature, this option too sounds less involved.


Appropriately titled the "History of Baghdad", the option is described as being similar to the series' traditional Codex, and has been built in partnership with a series of museums and international historical institutions.

Speaking out just a couple of weeks after the origins of Destiny's space golf ball The Traveller were finally revealed - to a somewhat mixed response - Bungie staff have defended Destiny's storytelling techniques, and said players should not expect to make allies with the game's villainous Hive.


"The Hive has still committed a lot of, you know, genocide," senior narrative designer Robert Brookes told Dexerto, pouring cold water on the Guardians and the Hive suddenly becoming besties.

Yes, that's right. If you head over to the eShop right now, you can get your hands on The Last Hope - Dead Zone Survival, an "intense storyline game set in an apocalyptic world overrun by hordes of ravenous zombies". Launched on 30th June, it normally costs £8.99 but is currently on sale for just 99p. 


Having played The Last Hope myself, I would advise saving your pennies for something more worthwhile. Toothpicks, perhaps. You can see a trailer for The Last Hope below (and if you were still interested in playing the game afterwards, please note there are spoilers for The Last Hope below).

The methods previously reported on Eurogamer, one using thrown weapons and another using frozen meat, now do not work in version 1.2.0 of the game. I've tested this myself, and am grateful I already cashed in 40k before I updated my version.

The Butcher, an infamous enemy from the first game, can randomly spawn in any dungeon, at any level, and is a particularly nasty foe to defeat.


Reddit user IronHeart_777 discovered a giant "beast of a Butcher" while running nightmare dungeons with friends, but don't worry - it's not actually a new version of the enemy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Wildcard's less-than-elegant rollout of Ark: Survival Ascended, a full-price remaster of its 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved, continues with the news of a delay from August to October this year, and word it'll now launch without its first bit of remastered DLC.


Ark: Survival Ascended has already had a bumpy start to life; the remaster first surfaced when Studio Wildcard announced it'd be taking Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers offline later this year, and that the only way to continue using official servers would be to purchase its new Unreal Engine 5 remaster - only available as part of a bundle with the now-delayed Ark 2. Following an outcry from players, Studio Wildcard eventually announced it would scrap the bundle, instead replacing it with a standalone version of Ark: Survival Ascended that was - amazingly - exactly the same price, despite featuring one less game.


It's in this context that Studio Wildcard has now announced a delay for Ascended, saying it has "found it challenging working with Unreal Engine 5.2".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a court filing submitted as part of its legal battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed Activision Blizzard aquisition, Microsoft has claimed Sony is "expected to release" both a PlayStation 5 Slim and a "handheld version of the PS5" before the end of this year.


Both machines were referenced during a paragraph (as spotted by IGN) intended to demonstrate that Nintendo's Switch should not - as the FTC is arguing - be considered in a separate market to Xbox and PlayStation based on price. It's a point Microsoft is determined to prove so it can more effectively assert its stated position as the underdog in the console market.


As part of its argument, Microsoft notes the Xbox Series S is $50 cheaper than Switch's OLED model in the US, with the $399.99 PS5 Digital Edition being just $50 more. It's here the company first makes reference to an unannounced Sony machine, claiming the latter is "expected to release a PlayStation 5 Slim later this year at the same reduced price point."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games, Apple has submitted a filing requesting the Supreme Court overthrows a 2021 ruling made by the US district court of California, which upheld a complaint against Apple's anti-steering practices.


Epic launched its lawsuit against Apple in August 2020, following the iPhone maker's decision to revoke Epic's Fortnite developer account, preventing the battle royale game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees.


As that case reached its conclusion, California's Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in all but one of its 10 claims. However, the one ruling made in Epic's favour - that Apple cannot block developers from linking out to alternative payment methods from within their apps (a practice known as "anti-steering") - has remained a sticking point for the company.

What's more, as reported by the FT (thanks IGN), current production issues have pushed back plans for a cheaper version of the $3499 headset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Have you ever been on a crowded train with one of your best gay friends and, inside, a tiny part of you is cringing because he is being so gay?"
That's a question posed by my favourite drag queen and Ireland's self-proclaimed gender discombobulator, Panti Bliss, in a biting speech about "checking" herself. What she's "checking" is something most queer people "check" for in public, whether they realise it or not: their own queerness. Am I standing too gay? What about these colourful socks? Are they too much? Will holding a partner's arm in public turn into a problem? Something private and intimate altered into something shameful or political, all through other people's reactions. 


That feeling's best thought of as the tension between who people expect us to be and who we really are... or who we're trying to become. Imagined futures are projected onto our bodies like film reels, blurring the skin that lies beneath. That tension feels a lot like shame. But, while video games usually have all the subtlety of a sledgehammer busting through a wall, they're occasionally a great place to explore queer topics, letting us role-play as whoever we want to be or explore those unique experiences in unique ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has cancelled development of its long-in-the-works Just Cause mobile game, which had been available in regional early access - but never fully launched - since November 2021.


Just Cause: Mobile was unveiled in December 2020, during The Game Awards, where it was billed as a free-to-play action shooter set in the Just Cause universe, featuring single-player, four-player co-op, and 30-person competitive multiplayer modes.


It was originally set to launch in 2021, and, did, eventually get a release in Singapore - albeit only as regional early access title - before the year was through. Since then, Just Cause: Mobile's early access has spread to a number of other countries but development has been repeatedly hit by delays, culminating in an indefinite delay toward the end of last year and, in February, the termination of all regional early access programmes.

The developer was given a second chance to resubmit their game but said, via Reddit, that this was also rejected - due to them not owning the necessary rights. 


Now, in a statement provided to Eurogamer, Valve has clarified a few points on this post, and provided further insight into how it will police AI-generated content on Steam in general.

A fresh rating for Red Dead Redemption via the leaky Korean Ratings Board popped up last week, setting tongues wagging that Rockstar had quietly submitted a fresh version of its cowboy classic to be approved for release.


Details of that listing pointed to a new console version of the game (thanks, Gematsu), rather than anything only for PC.

Entitled "Far Cry 1.34 Complete", the game's entire source code was uploaded to the internet archive site Archive.org at the end of June by a user called Llaetha.ro, and has since been shared across Reddit and social media.

It's unclear if the code includes any subsequent patches – although the .34 part of the 1.34 title certainly suggests so – and some commenters who've presumably downloaded and run the code believe the code is "not complete, but close".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has banned around 40 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) traders linked to gambling sites, essentially wiping out over £1.5m ($2m) worth of in-game trade items. 

As spotted by Dexerto (via PC Gamer), the bans come after gambling site CSGOEmpire published a spreadsheet of CS:GO traders it believed were part of a cryptocurrency money laundering scheme allegedly operating through a rival gambling site called CSGORoll. 

Whilst Valve has yet to comment on whether or not the bans were connected to the details revealed in the spreadsheet, it seems as though all but one of the accounts leaked on the spreadsheet have now been banned.

Right now the details are scarce, but Techland popped up on Twitter to inform fans that it was "joining forces" with Skybound's The Walking Dead for a new event in which you'll get to "survive, scavenge, and slay the undead like never before".

"We know a thing or two about fighting the undead," the official Twitter account for The Walking Dead responded, although neither account told us what the event will entail, nor when we can expect to play it – we've just been asked to "stay tuned for more info".

Last week, Diablo 4's lead class designer, Adam Jackson, jumped online to "clear up" the confusion around some of Diable 4's rarest unique items, and it's from Jackson that we learned the names of the six rarest ones: Andariel's Visage, Doombringer, Harlequin Crest, Melted Heart of Selig, Ring of Starless Skies, and The Grandfather.

Up until that point, some extraordinarily lucky players had discovered five of the six items, but the most elusive one, Melted Heart of Selig, was still the stuff of legend… until yesterday, it seems, when the item finally dropped for a Chinese necromancer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the second instalment of Toby Fox's reportedly seven-part "nonviolent" RPG Deltarune steadily approaching its second anniversary, fans are understandably eager to hear when more will be on the way, and while Fox mightn't be ready to divulge that particularly bit of information yet, he has now offered a development update.


Deltarune - which charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World - launched its first chapter toward the end of 2018 as a free download. A second instalment - also free - arrived in September 2021, followed by the news a third, fourth and fifth chapter will all launch simultaneously at a later date.


The big question for Deltarune fans, though, is when, and the answer, if Fox's latest progress report is anything to go by, still sounds very much like 'not any time soon'. Fox does reveal, however, the team is currently working on Chapter 3's last overworld area - and once that's done, "the chapter will finally be playable all the way through".

News that Ubisoft has finally decided to give everyone what they more or less wanted in the first place comes via Kotaku, which claims, citing two sources familiar with the publisher's plans, that the remake is "still in its earliest stages".


Ubisoft Singapore - the same studio still trying to finish the embattled Skull and Bones - is "heavily involved" with the project, which isn't expected to complete "for at least a few years".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment, the company behind this year's critically lambasted The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, is reportedly set to exit game development and has laid off around 25 employees as part of the move. Additionally, a second Lord of the Rings game in development at the studio is said to have been cancelled.


Daedalic's The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was announced in 2019 for release in 2021, finally arrived last month, following numerous setbacks and delays. Its reception was less-than-positive, however, with Eurogamer's Christian Donlan calling it a "well-intentioned mess" in his 1 out of 5 review. It was something of a surprise, then, when reports surfaced soon after that Daedalic was currently working on a second Lord of the Rings game.


According to German website Games Wirtschaft, however, that game - which has reportedly been in the works since mid-2022 - is no more, with development now cancelled as part of Daedalic's sudden decision to shift away from development and solely into publishing following Gollum's poor reception.

<p>There will probably a lot of faux outrage at this, but spying on foreign leaders is a perfectly legitimate use of the NSA&#8217;s capabilities and authorities.

Specifically, Sony was worried about the game's popularity among children causing problems for PlayStation.


The details come from a 2022 document uncovered as part of the FTC vs Microsoft trial, spotted by Axios, in which PlayStation boss Jim Ryan discusses Roblox's absence from Sony consoles - and admits his company's stance from the game is now shifting.

The court case between Microsoft and the FTC came to a close yesterday, after several days of testimonies, revelations and Sharpie-related blunders. 


During the proceedings, Microsoft's lawyer took to the floor in a bid to clear up a bit of a misunderstanding surrounding Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. However, in doing so, they perhaps made things a touch more confusing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has once again addressed the Xbox version of its upcoming RPG Baldur's Gate 3, confirming that while it's still in the work, the developer may ultimately be forced to make "compromises" in order to release on the platform.


Larian's struggles with Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox first surfaced in February, when - amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive - the studio confirmed it was working on an Xbox version but that it had "run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op."


In a statement provided to Digital Foundry shortly after, Larian explained its decision not to formally announced an Xbox release was more specifically down to issues it was having getting "split-screen co-op to work to the same standard on both Xbox Series X and S". And now, in an interview with IGN, studio founder and creative director Swen Vincke has shared more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were first introduced to Pioneers of Pagonia, a new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich, earlier this year, there wasn't much to go on beyond a brief description and a teaser video. Now, though, with its early access release steadily drawing nearer, we've been given a first proper look at the thing via a new in-game trailer.


Pioneers of Pagonia, to get the fundamentals out the way, sets players loose on the titular (and procedurally generated) islands of Pagonia with the goal of establishing a presence through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover - and the alliances they forge with Pagonia's not always friendly inhabitants - along the way.


40 different building types have also been promised for Pioneers of Pagonia's Steam early access launch, along with more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. A co-op mode is also planned, meaning you'll be able to be a ruinous blight on the land (or otherwise, I suppose) with a friend in tow.

RoboCop: Rogue City - which is build around an "original story" set between RoboCop 2 and 3 - looks to land somewhere between a first-person shooter and cybernetically enhanced detective adventure, whisking players to the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit to solve crimes, slay baddies, and perhaps even turn a few wrong 'uns into goo.


"Explore open areas and complete your objectives according to your own sense of justice," explains Teyon. "Finding evidence, interrogation and maintaining public order are just some of your daily tasks as a police officer. But don't take decisions lightly: your choices can determine the fate of citizens and the result of your mission."

And it was a typically strong showing for the publisher, offering a fresh look at some already announced titles - including the new one from Sayonara Wild Hearts' studio Simogo and the fascinating Cocoon - as well as some big reveals. From stunning photographic adventures to an honest-to-goodness new Blade Runner game, there's a lot to look forward to in the months and year ahead, and a full round-up of the showcase can be found below.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes

Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo's latest is a baroque blend of surreal mystery thriller and puzzle adenture, faintly bringing to mind the studio's iOS classic Device 6. It focuses on a woman's search for answers, deep in a strange manor house, as players attempt to solve the enigma at its heart. There's no release date yet, but we do it's coming to Switch and Steam - and while we await further details, there's a tantilising new trailer above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Microsoft argues with the Federal Trade Commission in the US over its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Canada moved to refute the Xbox maker's claims that, the FTC excluded, "all but one" regulator around the world is onboard with its deal - noting that Canada is still 'monitoring the transaction'.


As reported by The Verge, Canada's Competition Bureau has written to Judge Corley, who is currently presiding over the FTC's Activision Blizzard case in the US, to correct certain "factual inaccuracies" in Microsoft's court filings.


Microsoft had told the court that "every single worldwide regulator that has examined the deal other than the FTC has rejected" the theory it would remove Call of Duty from PlayStation should the acquisition go through, and that all regulators agreed "withholding COD from Sony would be unprofitable and is thus not a serious concern." It also claimed "all but one foreign regulator" (namely the UK's CMA) had cleared the transaction.

The company will close its recently-released NBA All-World game, end development of its upcoming Marvel World of Heroes project, and shut down its Los Angeles development studio. The news was communicated to staff via an email from company founder John Hanke, which has now been made public.


Pokémon Go, which remains lucrative, is safe. Indeed, Hanke calls it the company's "top priority" as it slims down and refocuses on the future.

A big draw this month is Darkwood, the nightmarish survival horror game from Acid Wizard Studio, which will be available between 1st July until 31st July.

Darkwood, which originally released on PC in 2017, is a frightening horror experience that combines exploration, combat, scavenging, crafting and survival into an extremely unusual whole. Our Donlan called it "a masterclass in how to undermine the audience in tiny, gnat-bite ways" when he played it back in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we look back at a week of headlines from Microsoft's time in court arguing its case to buy Activision Blizzard with the FTC.

In the video game industry, courtroom drama does not get much bigger than this. Microsoft's Phil Spencer and Satya Nadella, Sony's Jim Ryan and Activision boss Bobby Kotick have all given evidence as the US weighs up whether to allow Xbox's enormous Call of Duty buyout to procede.
The week has brought us some eye-opening opinions from these top industry execs, as well as a treasure trove of emails to pore through - and some badly-redacted documentation. Today, we recap the biggest stories of the week, including who else was on Microsoft's studio shopping list, and why Bethesda is upset at Call of Duty not being platform exclusive. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

After a week with the game - and you can read some of my early thoughts here - I've come to use it sparingly, but appreciate its existence.


As its name suggests, the feature allows you to skip backwards and undo any sudden calamity. Though in doing so, my initial fear was it risked devaluing the Pikmin series' usual high stakes.


After all, the frequent likelihood of imminent Pikmin death - their agonising squeals, the sad sight of their soul floating slowly upwards - acts to ensure you approach each situation with care.

Ryan, speaking in pre-recorded video testimony, also claimed other publishers "unanimously do not like Game Pass" for that reason. When pressed by Microsoft's lawyer, he added: "I talk to publishers all the time, and this is a very commonly-held view over many years by the publishers."
Talking to Eurogamer yesterday, Miles Jacobson, studio head of Sports Interactive, the Sega-owned developer of the ever-popular Football Manager series, disagreed with that quite directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has had its exhibits pulled from court after failing to properly redact financial information.


As part of the ongoing Microsoft vs FTC court case, Sony provided documentation detailing confidential information about its PlayStation business. As is custom, key details in this documentation were redacted. At least, they were meant to be. 


Thanks to the retrospectively poor choice of using a Sharpie marker to redact the key information, it's easy to see the contents of these redactions now the document has been scanned.

The Kubernetes community has been signing their container image-based artifacts
since release v1.24. While the graduation of the corresponding enhancement
from alpha to beta in v1.26 introduced signatures for the binary artifacts,
other projects followed the approach by providing image signatures for their
releases, too. This means that they either create the signatures within their
own CI/CD pipelines, for example by using GitHub actions, or rely on the
Kubernetes image promotion process to automatically sign the images by
proposing pull requests to the k/k8s.io repository. A requirement for
using this process is that the project is part of the kubernetes or
kubernetes-sigs GitHub organization, so that they can utilize the community
infrastructure for pushing images…]]></summary>

The Cycle: Frontier, which arrived on PC last June, sees teams of players - in the role of Prospectors - airdropping onto a hostile alien planet in order to gather resources, fend off predators and competing teams with a steadily expanding arsenal, then whizz back into space at the end with all their hard-earned spoils.


The game has seen three seasons of updates since its launch last summer, but Yager has now announced development is coming to an end, with its most recent patch being its last.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of Microsoft's court battle with US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission, emails between Xbox boss Phil Spencer and PlayStation head Jim Ryan have been revealed, outlining Microsoft's initial proposal to Sony - regarding the Activision Blizzard games it would be willing to keep on the PlayStation platform should its $69bn acquisition be approved - and Ryan's lengthy counter-proposal.


As confirmed by Phil Spencer last September, Microsoft contacted Sony shortly after the January announcement of its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, providing a signed agreement to Sony guaranteeing Call of Duty would remain on PlayStation - with feature and content parity - for "at least several more years beyond" Sony current contract.


During his FTC deposition this week, Ryan admitted he "wasn't particularly" happy with Microsoft's original proposal, but "hoped it was an opening salvo" - and we now have a more precise picture of his initial response, thanks to newly revealed emails, as spotted by The Verge's Tom Warren. In a reply dated 26th May, Ryan informed Spencer that Microsoft's proposal "did not fulfil" the objective of "ensuring Activision Blizzard games are available on PlayStation", and that the company had "serious concerns" which an enclosed counter-proposal from Sony was intended to address.

The idea was floated among Xbox top brass back in 2019 - before Square Enix sold its suite of Western studios, and before Microsoft got entangled in its current attempted $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout. 


Documents showing Microsoft's interest in acquiring Square Enix surfaced today, as the company continues to plead its case with the Federal Trade Commission.

Alan Wake Remastered is particularly noteworthy ahead of the sequel's release on 17th October. Perhaps it'll come to Xbox Game Pass before then too?

Microsoft's court battle with US antitrust agency the FTC continued last night, with testimony from Ryan. During a pre-recorded video regarding Microsoft's ongoing bid to purchase Activision Blizzard, the exec shared further insight on the takeover, and the impact it could have on Sony.


When asked directly if he had any issues with Redfall or Starfield being exclusive, Ryan replied: "I don't like it but it's not anti-competitive" (thanks, IGN)

McDonald has been busy getting the game running at 60fps for some time - a video from 2020 shows the game at 60fps on a PS4 Pro. Digital Foundry tested their own PS5 version with AI upscaling you can watch below.


McDonald's new video has the game running natively on a PS5 at 1080p, without upscaling or interpolation. In McDonald's words, it's "just raw gameplay capture".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go developer Niantic has infuriated fans by reverting a positive change to the game's spawn radius that let you see Pokémon spawns from twice as far away. 


The change went live earlier this week and was praised by players. But, last night, Niantic announced via Twitter that the buff would be removed. 


Adding to the confusion is the fact that the game's community leaders - who are regularly fed information by Niantic - were allegedly told the game was working "as intended" with the spawn change applied.

The first is Landstalker, an isometric adventure developed by Climax Entertainment and released in 1993 in which players take the role of treasure hunter Nigel (no, really). Many of the team went on to develop Alundra for the PlayStation, considered something of a spiritual successor to Landstalker.

Experience rewards have been buffed for Nightmare Dungeons - specifically increasing the experience for both killing monsters in these dungeons and completing them - making them well suited for high level players looking to grind.


Helltide chests will also provide "substantially more bonus experience when opened", and Whispers have similarly had a significant increase in rewarded experience.

Brilliant post-apocatalyptic feline simulator Stray is among those getting the chop - just ahead of publisher Annapurna Interactive's upcoming digital showcase event, where we may see an Xbox version of the game.


Live-service game flop Marvel's Avengers is also being removed, although the game itself will still be playable if you pay and gets its final update in September.

Writing on the BioWare website, McKay explained that "most of the current team will be invited to accompany" Star Wars: The Old Republic as its development switches over to Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot studio Broadsword Online Games - a move EA previously said was necessary so BioWare could focus on its new Mass Effect and Dragon Age titles.


"Unfortunately," McKay continued, "not every role will make the move. This is the hardest part of this transition, and these decisions were not made lightly."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 5 - or Project Rene, as EA is currently calling - is still some considerable way from release, but that isn't stopping developer Maxis from showing off its early experiments exploring what this "next generation" Sims game could be - and the studio has now shared a little more as part of its latest Sims stream.


When Project Rene was officially unveiled in October last year, EA teased a game built on a foundation of "charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories" that would be designed with real-time collaboration in mind (solo play is still supported) and be simultaneously playable across a range of devices, including mobile and PC.


At the time, footage was limited to some expanded creativity tools inspired by The Sims 3's Create a Style options, but Project Rene's latest airing in EA's new Behind the Sims showcase (which also had a lot to say about horses) has gone into a little more detail about what The Sims 5 might look like if Maxis' current experiments prove fruitful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has announced a new batch of titles heading to its Apple Arcade subscription service in July, including two particularly notable oldies-but-goodies: Stardew Valley and Slay the Spire, which both arrive in '+' form, denoting they were previously available on the iOS App Store.


Stardew Valley+, as if it needs an introduction, is developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's wildly popular spin on the farm life sim genre, having now sold over 20m copies since its launch in 2016. Apple Arcade subscribers will have the opportunity to succumb to its endearing blend of agricultural wealth accumulation and pixel wooing from 28th July.


As for Slay the Spire+, it's also a bit of a modern classic. Developer Mega Crit Games' roguelike deck-building dungeon-crawler - which sees players attempting to fend off monsters and scale the titular spire with nothing but a fist of battle-ready cards - is a wonderfully refined, richly rewarding experience, and well worth seeking out.

As reported by Variety, the new series - which is being handled by Big Mouth and Star: Trek Lower Decks animation studio Titmouse - looks to be adhering closely to the core murder-and-deduction premise of its video game source material.


The show's official longline reads, "Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone. Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Air Twister, the on-rails 3D shooter and Space Harrier spiritual successor from legendary Sega designer Yu Suzuki is heading to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 10th November this year.


Air Twister, which launched for Apple's Apple Arcade subscription service last June, sees players battling alien invaders through 12 stages - and across various modes including  Arcade, Turbo, and Boss Rush - to save a planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


The ensuing action is a bit Space Harrier and a bit Panzer Dragoon - at certain points players take to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and Yu Suzuki has previously said Air Twister was inspired by a fantasy shooting game he envisaged in the 80s, before pivoting toward Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 arrives this October more than than 13 years after Remedy's original game, and after a number of false starts at getting the sequel made. 


Much of developer Remedy's original pitch for the sequel eventually worked its way into Alan Wake's American Nightmare, the action-heavy 2012 standalone spinoff which, while not unanimously loved by critics, went on to be one of the cult hits of the old Xbox Live Arcade days.


Remedy has continued to work on ideas for a full sequel ever since, through the period where it released Quantum Break - the Xbox One exclusive that mixed time-bending action and shooting with live-action TV episodes - and then the fellow "Remedy connected universe" entry Control.

In particular, the game will include The Eye of the Wanderer, which will allow players to pin screenshots to the map to help with exploration.


"The genre is quite dependent on being able to 'take mental notes'; remembering and visualising things like blocked paths, or situations that need tools or powers that you don't have," said senior game designer Rémi Boutin.

That's according to the series' executive producer Tomek Baginski, who has discussed the upcoming third season of the show - the last to star Henry Cavill as the protagonist - in an interview with Yahoo News, where the shift to Hemsworth for future seasons was mentioned.

Story spoilers for The Witcher book series and games follow.

Earlier this year, the Hitman developer announced it was working on a "bold" new franchise. Very little else was shared, other than a tease it would feel both familiar and "unlike anything" the studio had done before. No platforms, or even a project name, were announced at this time.


However, evidence submitted in the ongoing FTC vs Microsoft trial suggests this upcoming release - known (for now) as Project Dragon - will seemingly be an Xbox console exclusive.

The email, sent to Xbox exec Tim Stuart, has publicly surfaced now during Microsoft's ongoing courtroom battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout. In it, Booty encourages Xbox to make further acquisitions to bolster Game Pass and compete with Sony.


"We (Microsoft) are in a very unique position to be able to go spend Sony out of business," Booty wrote, in reference to planned spending of spending $2-3bn in 2020 to avoid competitors getting ahead.

Bethesda marketing exec Pete Hines emailed bosses, including Todd Howard, to highlight the approach Microsoft was taking with Activision in order to court regulatory approval and note that it was "the opposite" of what Bethesda itself had just been "asked (told) to do" with its own games. 


The email, dated 2nd October last year, expresses concern that Bethesda would be publicly questioned on why games like Starfield are Xbox-only following Microsoft's acquisition, as opposed to future incarnations of Call of Duty after Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Microsoft's court battle with US antitrust agency the FTC rumbles on, more and more juicy snippets of behind-closed-doors business doings are beginning to surface via released internal documents, and today's minor revelation comes via the news that Microsoft reportedly gave serious consideration to buying Sega - and other companies including Bungie and IO Interactive - to help it accelerate Xbox Game Pass.


This little bit of what-might-have-been comes via internal Microsoft documents spotted by The Verge, beginning with an email from Xbox boss Phil Spencer to CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, requesting strategy approval to approach Sega Sammy about a potential acquisition of its Sega games division.


Spencer suggested Sega's "well-balanced portfolio of games across segments with global geographic appeal" would help Microsoft "accelerate Xbox Game Pass both on and off-console", and that Sega's "beloved IP" would be particularly effective in helping Games Pass reach new audiences in Asia, "where localised content is critical to success".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a day after Bethesda said Starfield's physical release would not include a disc, a resurfaced post on the company's website has further suggested otherwise - for Xbox users at least.


Word that Starfield's physical editions would not include a disc first came via a tweet from Bethesda support over the weekend, which, in answer to a customer query, said, "All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs".


The outcry was immediate, with fans understandably concerned Microsoft was planning to take advantage of Starfield's high-profile release in order to plunge its customers into a digital-only future. That now appears to be less of a concern, however, based on details included in a newly resurfaced pre-order bonus breakdown post on Bethesda's website - which corrobrates a tweet unearthed over the weekend on the company's Twitter account for Spain,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a day after Bethesda said Starfield's physical release would not include a disc, a resurfaced post on the company's website has further suggested otherwise - for Xbox users at least.


Word that Starfield's physical editions would not include a disc first came via a tweet from Bethesda support over the weekend, which, in answer to a customer query, said, "All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs".


The outcry was immediate, with fans understandably concerned Microsoft was planning to take advantage of Starfield's high-profile release in order to plunge its customers into a digital-only future. That now appears to be less of a concern, however, based on details included in a newly resurfaced pre-order bonus breakdown post on Bethesda's website - which corrobrates a tweet unearthed over the weekend on the company's Twitter account for Spain,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a VR fan and desperate for yet another subscription service to sign up to, you're in luck! Meta has announced - and launched - Meta Quest+, a new subscription package promising access to "the best titles" on its virtual reality platforms.


Meta Quest+ isn't quite the Game Pass or PlayStation Plus Extra-style smorgasbord you might be envisaging, however; instead, it'll give subscribers access to two "handpicked VR titles" each month from a selection of Quest's "biggest hits, hidden gems, and back-catalog classics".


Meta Quest+ is available to Quest 2 and Quest Pro users, and costs £7.99/$7.99 USD a month or £59.99/$59.99 annually - a savings of over 37%, Meta notes. Curious sorts can get their first month's subscription for £1/$1 as long as they sign up before 31st July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Closing in on four year since its announcement, Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot is still nowhere to be seen, and a new report claims a succession of unfortunate setbacks has lead to "little meaningful progress" on the project since its 2020 unveiling.


When Microsoft revealed its Perfect Dark reboot for Xbox during The Game Awards in December 2020, it confirmed the project was being developed by The Initiative, the Santa Monica-based studio founded by Crystal Dynamics veteran Darrell Gallagher.


Since then, sporadic reports have suggested something of a tumultuous journey for the project; Crystal Dynamics was brought in to assist The Initiative in September 2021, game director Dan Neuburger departed the studio in March last year, and an exodus of over 30 key staff was reported shortly after - causing head of Microsoft Studios Matt Booty to insist the game wasn't in trouble during a panel talk in September 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in May, from an FAQ provided by developer Remedy, Alan Wake 2 will only have a digital release when it launches on October 17th later this year, with "no plans" for a physical release on disc at the time.
This has naturally sparked some concern among certain fans, with digital-only downloads posing issues for both game preservation, as shown by the closure of the Nintendo 3DS eShop in March this year, as well as ownership rights, exemplified by the infamously de-listed survival horror spinoff PT.
Speaking to Eurogamer at Summer Games Fest earlier this month, Alan Wake 2's creative director Sam Lake and game director Kyle Rowley gave us a little more detail on the reasoning behind going digital-only, explaining that, actually, it was to allow Remedy more time to polish the game to an acceptable level - something publisher Epic Games had also been on board with.

As spotted by Timo653 over on Reddit, developers such as series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and producer Daisuke Sato - who both left Sega several years ago to form Nagoshi Studio, a subsidiary of NetEase Games - are no longer credited for their work on the games. 


Meanwhile, the entirety of Lab42 (which worked on 0 and Kiwami 1, helping to bring these games to PC) and QLOC (which worked on Kiwami 2 to 6) have also seen their credits removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Sons of the Forest patch introduces drivable golf carts, decorative animal heads, and a new boss battle and end-game cutscene.

Along with the usual list of quality-of-life and bug fixes, Endnight Games' latest patch, Patch 07, continues to build on the survival horror's impressive launch by introducing several new features, as well as improving the hitherto stark environs to the east side of the map. Oh, and there are new dedicated servers, too. 

"This patch adds a new boss battle along with a new cutscene to the end of the game, as well as drivable golf carts, a rifle which can be found in one of the caves, frogs that sit on lily pads and chirp, the ability to chop heads off dead animals and use them as wall decorations, a bunch of stone building improvements and lots more," the development team explains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of horror's most iconic figures is making a comeback: Slender Man.

Whilst, as yet, developer Blue Isle Studios is keeping tight-lipped on what's next for the supernatural being, the team recently dropped a tweet teasing a return for the creepypasta mascot a full decade after Slender: The Arrival.

Born by way of an internet urban legend in 2009, Slender Man has popped up in many fan-made and indie horror games, but his most notable in-game appearances include Slender: The Eight Pages in 2012 and 2013's Slender: The Arrival before a highly-publicised stabbing incident and moral panic saw the fictional entity go dark for several years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Escape From Tarkov developer Battlestate Games has vowed to ban "all personalities" found to have datamined "information that is intentionally hidden from users" and any players who share it.

In a statement, the studio defined what it believed datamining to be – the practice of "extracting information from massive datasets" and "illegal infiltration of in-game code and databases in order to extract information that is intentionally hidden from users" – and said that "in-game accounts involved in datamining and/or sharing data originating from datamining" will be banned, and "further actions taken afterwards".

"Throughout the past few years, there was an increase of datamined information circling around various websites as well as accounts on social media," the team explains. "While some players believe that the developers of Escape from Tarkov are not sharing information about hidden changes of the game, we also would like to remind that any data retrieval without official permission is a direct breach of [...] the license agreement."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls 6 is unlikely to release for at least "five-plus" years.

That's according to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who recently confirmed that the latest instalment of the highly-anticipated RPG series was still "five-plus years away".

As reported by Axios' Stephen Totilo – who had been live-tweeting the outcomes from day two of the US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)/Microsoft court case all yesterday – Spencer was "asked a lot" about how Microsoft decides platform exclusivity, with much of the questioning framed around Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax.

 As the test is private and open only to pre-selected players, scalpers are trying their luck and flogging their codes, even though the test is free and only running this weekend, closing at 4pm BST/8am PDT on Monday, 26th June.

Oklahoma will be American Truck Simulator's 13th explorable state when it makes its eventual debut - it joins California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas - and promises a tour of "wonderful state parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends."


You can get a brief taste of the expansion's highways, byways, and sweeping vistas in SCS Software's newly released Oklahoma gameplay preview trailer below - which, as ever, is basically video game ASMR, so dim the lights, grab a pillow, and let your cares drift away amid the gentle murmur of digital wheels on digital tarmac.

It all started after Twitter user Nitroid began poking around the Metal Gear portal website and noticed a spot of oddness with Konami's updated Metal Gear timeline.


The gist of the discovery is that Konami's revised graphic featured a number of inactive buttons for old games pointing to new pages, leading to speculation that these particular titles - Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and Metal Gear Solid 5 - were being primed for a re-release as part of a Master Collection Vol. 2.

Speaking to Eurogamer, Remedy boss Sam Lake revealed he had "really, really, desperately wanted" to be able to open the game with a quote from King himself - whose style matches much of the spooky supernatural horror that follows.

A special birthday update for Sonic Frontiers has been on the cards for some time now, having been announced as part of an expansive post-launch support roadmap at the end of last year. Now, however, with Sonic's big day finally here, we've got a clearer idea of what it'll bring.


For starters, the ordinarily rather drab world of Sonic Frontiers gets a splash of birthday cheer, festooned with the likes of balloons, wrapping paper, and other decor. Additionally, there's a jaunty party hat outfit for Sonic so everyone can properly get in the mood.

Destiny 1, which launched almost nine years ago, introduced The Traveller as a mysterious dormant entity that previously held magical powers, as well as the ability to hold back the ominous-sounding Darkness. 


Where had it come from? What were the nature of its powers? Was the Traveller actually a bad guy? I remember wondering all of these things as I looked up at the orb from Destiny's first Tower hub.

"It is not an exclusivity play at all," Ryan wrote in an email to former PlayStation Europe boss Chris Deering. "They're thinking bigger than that.

ORIGINAL STORY 10.11pm: Following the shock cancellation of this year's E3 back in March, new details shared by the Los Angeles City Tourism Department suggest the games industry trade show won't be making a comeback anytime soon, with shows scheduled for 2024 and 2025 now also seemingly cancelled.


As spotted by Restera, the Entertainment Software Association, which owns E3, had initially booked the Los Angeles Convention Centre for the weeks beginning 11th June 2024 and 3rd June 2025 - dates shared as part of a Los Angeles City Tourism Department report last October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why, it's horse, of course! As widely expected thanks to a few cheeky leaks earlier this week, The Sims 4 is ushering in a new age of the equine for its next paid expansion; Horse Ranch, as the release is known, arrives on 20th July for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


Horse Ranch's primary focus is Chestnut Ridge, a new rustic prairie world inspired by the American West. Here, players can live out an idyllic life - either in a traditional country cabin or in something with a few more mod cons - caring for mini goats, mini sheep, and, of course, horses, which can be rescued, bred, purchased, customised, and raised from foals.


Sims not afraid to get their hands dirty have plenty of options on the ranch, from mucking out horse beds to harvesting prairie grass for the animal feeder, and it's even possible to brew moonsh... sorry, Nectar, by smashing up fruit and veg then ageing the results on Nectar racks ready for sale. There's also sheep shearing, goat milking, and other animal interactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking during today's FTC hearing, Bethesda's Pete Hines has confirmed the company's upcoming Indiana Jones game will be exclusive to Xbox and PC, with the court being told a multi-console contract was amended following the company's acquisition by Microsoft.


Bethesda announced its Indiana Jones game back in January 2021, confirming it was being developed by Wolfenstein studio MachineGames. However, it failed to make mention of the platforms it would target, a notable omission at the time given Microsoft's then-impending $7.5bn USD acquisition of Bethesda and Zenimax.


Little has been heard of the game since that initial reveal, but it's now burst back into the spotlight in something of an unexpected way - during a witness testimony from Bethesda's head of global publishing Pete Hines, as part of US antitrust agency the FTC's court proceedings to secure an injunction to block Microsoft's $69bn Activision Blizzard deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just three years after its much-heralded arrival, Activision is pulling the plug on the original Call of Duty: Warzone. The free-to-play battle royale shooter set to go offline on 21st September.


Call of Duty: Warzone launched along Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2020, but was renamed Warzone Caldera after the arrival of its similarly styled successor, Warzone 2.0, last November.


Warzone Caldera has remained available in the months since then - meaning players have been able to continue using real-money purchases including skins and weapons unavailable in 2.0 - but now Activision has signalled the end is in sight for the original experience, warning that all progression, inventories, and online services will "expire" in September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss yesterday's Mario-packed Nintendo Direct and Microsoft's surprise price rises.

For Nintendo, yesterday's online extravaganza acted like a shot of adrenaline to Switch's aging heart. There had been questions around how much Nintendo might still have for Switch, post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Now we have answers - and a release schedule busier than either Microsoft or Sony's for the remainder of 2023. Switch 2 certainly now feels even longer away.
Microsoft, meanwhile, took advantage of the Elephant Mario in the room to announce it's long-suspected price rises for Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Series X. It was an oppurtune moment for Microsoft to deliver the bad news, with the value of Game Pass demonstrated last week at its well-receieved Xbox Game Showcase. Still, was it really necessary? Or could it just get away with it because PlayStation blinked first? Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

The main aim is to provide a new way for viewer messages to stand out in a busy, fast moving chat, as well as an additional method for streamers to make money.


Messages can be purchased from $1 to $500 (with streamers able to set a minimum up to $100) and the duration, character count, and visual design of the pin will depend on the amount spent. Twitch will take a 30 percent cut of revenue earned.

The Past Within is the latest in a series that has so far spanned 15 loosely interconnected games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banners, with another one - the recently announced Underground Blossom - expected to arrive on PC later this year.


Like its predecessors, The Past Within delivers a deliciously surreal mix of casual point-and-click puzzling and room escape action, albeit this time given a devious co-operative twist.

        <updated>2023-06-22T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Action roguelike Midautumn is named after the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the most important events of the calendar for many countries in Asia. It's a celebration of the full moon, usually falling in September or October, though traditions vary between countries. For me, it's a time of year I'll always associate with the mooncakes my grandma shares with us. For Midautumn developer Sherveen Uduwana, it brings back memories of attending these festivals as a child, and the comfort of lanterns and fireworks floating in the dark night sky.


Available in demo form during LudoNarraCon last month, Midautumn's blend of thematic storytelling and action mechanics immediately caught my eye - as well as its name. Still, Uduwana is aware Midautumn's title - and the experiences within Asian diaspora communities that inspired him - won't immediately feel familiar to many others. "I think a lot of folks I was pitching it to were like, why is it called Midautumn?" Uduwana tells me, adding that he settled on the name very early on. "There's a specific type of person who, when they find out the game is called Midautumn, gets very excited."


Uduwana tried pitching the game in a traditional way to secure funding, but the culture gap - and then, more significantly, the pandemic and the wave of anti-Asian sentiment surrounding it - caused him to opt for a more indie development approach instead. "That galvanised me to just be like, I'm just gonna message people and we'll try and make it," he says. "I was tired of having to explain why people would relate to it, or why it would be something that would be exciting for folks. A lot of people in those positions of power are just not really tuned into those specific communities."

Current categories exist for All Ages, 9+ and 13+, and Roblox has traditionally been seen as a place popular for children to play. 


But Roblox's audience is growing older - a natural step as the game matures in age and retains players as it does so - and 38 percent of Roblox's most active users were 17 and older in 2022, Roblox has said, making it the game's fastest-growing age group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has said that Sony would no longer be able to share details of its upcoming console hardware with Call of Duty maker Activision, if Microsoft's proposed $68.7bn buyout was approved by regulators.


Speaking to the US Federal Trade Commission, which is currently involved in legal proceedings to block the deal, Ryan said Sony "simply could not run the risk of a company that was owned by a direct competitor having access to that information".


Ryan's comments date from April this year, when the FTC questioned the PlayStation CEO on statements submitted by Sony designed to give its perspective on the deal. Chief among those is the worry by Sony that its game development processes would be interrupted as it "could no longer share confidential details about its next console in development".

This Friday more specifically marks 32 years since Sonic's western debut on Sega Mega Drive, which technically (if I have my hedgehog lore right) means he'll be celebrating his 47th birthday given his age in the first game. So before his back gives out completely, Sega will presumably be keen to shove as many announcement out as possible.


Friday's Sonic Central, then, is promising a "sneak peek of some of our upcoming projects, partnerships, and events happening in 2023".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced a price hike for its Xbox Series X console across most of the world, as well as for monthly Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions, with the increases set to come into effect over the next few months.


As reported by The Verge, Xbox Game Pass for Console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be impacted by the changes first. Prices are set to rise for new customers on 6th July, but existing monthly subscribers won't see the changes until 13th August (13th September in Germany).


Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will increase from £10.99/€12.99/$14.99 USD a month to £12.99/€14.99/$16.99, while Game Pass for Console rises from £7.99/€9.99/$8.99 a month to £8.99/€10.99/$10.99. Xbox Game Pass for PC will be unaffected.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The computer security research community regularly tackles ethical questions. The field of ethics / moral philosophy has for centuries considered what it means to be &#8220;morally good&#8221; or at least &#8220;morally allowed / acceptable.&#8221; Among philosophy&#8217;s contributions are (1) frameworks for evaluating the morality of actions&#8212;including the well-established consequentialist and deontological frameworks&#8212;and (2) scenarios (like trolley problems) featuring moral dilemmas that can facilitate discussion about and intellectual inquiry into different perspectives on moral reasoning and decision-making. In a classic trolley problem, consequentialist and deontological analyses may render different opinions. In this research, we explicitly make and explore connections between moral questions in computer security research and ethics / moral philosophy through the creation and analysis of trolley problem-like computer security-themed moral dilemmas and, in doing so, we seek to contribute to conversations among security researchers about the morality of security research-related decisions. We explicitly do not seek to define what is morally right or wrong, nor do we argue for one framework over another. Indeed, the consequentialist and deontological frameworks that we center, in addition to coming to different conclusions for our scenarios, have significant limitations. Instead, by offering our scenarios and by comparing two different approaches to ethics, we strive to contribute to how the computer security research field considers and converses about ethical questions, especially when there are different perspectives on what is morally right or acceptable. Our vision is for this work to be broadly useful to the computer security community, including to researchers as they embark on (or choose not to embark on), conduct, and write about their research, to program committees as they evaluate submissions, and to educators as they teach about computer security and ethics...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

But after today's Nintendo Direct we have a much clearer picture of what's still to come, with a look at Pikmin 4 headlining the showcase, plus reveals of a Super Mario RPG remake and a brand new 2D Mario game.


First, though, Nintendo showed a fresh look at the forthcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC heading to Switch later this year.

Wave five will arrive this summer, complete with a new course known as Squeaky Clean Sprint. 


From what we can see in the trailer, this course looks to be taking us around a sud-filled bathroom, with plenty of bubbles and bottles to negotiate. It will be joined by another seven courses, which are yet to be announced.

At first glance, Super Mario Bros. Wonder's presentation is all very New Super Mario, with its crisp, clean lines - albeit this time slightly stylised - and familiar Mario motifs. But then, midway through its announcement trailer, Mario encounters a new power-up and things get weird.


Warp pipes come alive in wiggly choreography, heaving and bending all over the place; spherical cows come tumbling in; Mario - and the world around him - gets a new stretchy, silhouetted look, and here come mega-herds of adorable sheep!

Several developers have flirted with this new technology, with the likes of Ubisoft announcing its Ghostwriter AI tool earlier this year. Meanwhile, the High on Life team used AI to create video game voice dialogue.


Last week, I had the opportunity to chat with voice actors Jennifer Hale and David Hayter about their upcoming release, Synapse, and during this conversation, the topic of AI came up.


"I have been staying on top of it," Hale assured me when I asked about the actors' personal take on the matter. "And the number one thing I want to say to everybody out there is: Stay out of fear. Stay in action."

The first Pikmin introduced the world to Captain Olimar and his titular half-plant, half-animal pals back on GameCube in 2001. A sequel followed in 2004, expanding on the original's real-time strategy style puzzling with new Pikmin, cave exploration, and more.


Since then, both titles have received gentle updates for Wii, introducing a pointer-style control system. However, it's not entirely clear which editions of Pikmin 1 & 2 are coming to Switch, with Nintendo only referring to them as "HD versions".

Details are still incredibly sparse. The short teaser showed the platform's Princess Toadstool making her way along a rather fairytale-looking street set on a theatre stage. Then she made a tree burst into bloom to open a door, all thanks to a nifty use of magic. 


She then magically changed from her standard pink dress into something a little more dazzling, and the trailer ends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's decision to keep Bethesda's games exclusive is "powerful evidence" against its Activision Blizzard takeover bid, US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission has said.


Earlier this month, the FTC succeeded in getting a temporary ban placed on Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout bid. Now, ahead of an upcoming hearing regarding the agency's request for a preliminary injunction, the FTC has submitted further documentation on the matter.


In a new and heavily redacted filing, the FTC has refered back to Microsoft's acquisition of ZeniMax and Bethesda. The company stated Microsoft's decision to make ZeniMax games exclusive is "powerful evidence of incentive to foreclosure".

However, plenty of fans have been positively clamouring for their heavily rumoured arrival - and it looks like EA has finally relented, teasing they'll be coming very soon.


The Sims 4 developer Maxis has been on something of a fan-pleasing crusade of late; last year marked the long-awaited return of werewolves, for instance, alongside more robust options for Sims teens, while 2023 has bought babies back in a big way.

Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope received an extremely positive critical reception when it launched last October, with many praising the smart refinements it bought its predecessor's already wonderfully engaging strategic core.


Its commercial reception was far more muted, however; in an emergency investor call held at the start of the year to share news of its considerably lower-than- expected earnings, Ubisoft admitted it had been "surprised" by Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope's "underperformance in the final weeks of 2022 and early January".

Back in December, the company announced an end to "large scale updates" for the game nine months after its release. This included the removal of its in-game mythril shop (in January) used for microtransactions.



The game has an updated release date in the eShop (31st May 2023 in the UK store), seemingly related to the Chocobo GP Lite version of the game that no longer exists.

This includes the game's split-screen multiplayer mode - a long-standing feature of the series since Pikmin 2 - and what looks like the ability for a second player to aid you in the game's main campaign via some kind of targeting reticule.


Environments shown off here appear to include the interior of a house - a dramatic departure for the series which has so far stayed outside (or underground). And yes, spoilers for Pikmin 1, the series is indeed set on Earth.

This is Us actress Melanie Liburd, who stars in Alan Wake 2 as its new co-protagonist, had been due to appear at one point, Keighley said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Next Fest, Valve's semi-regular celebration of gaming things to come, is back for another week of developer chats, livestreams, and an intimidating stack of "hundreds" of demos likely to thwart even the most committed completionist.


Proceedings are now firmly underway, continuing until next Monday 26th June, and Valve has provided a full list of available demos and livestreams for those eager to dive right in. But should decision paralysis strike, you'll find a few potentially promising places to start - based on some of the games Eurogamer has been harbouring mounting excitement for in recent times - below.


The list is far from exhaustive, of course, and all the games I've included are largely known quantities - it'll take a lot more poking around Valve's subterranean depths before Steam Next Fest's latest batch of hidden gems reveals itself. But in the meantime, while the poking continues, perhaps the following will provide some initial inspiration - and if anything catches your eye as you do your own deeper delving, feel free to share in the comments.

The glitch is relatively simple and requires a couple of weapons, some raw meat, and at least 57 Zonaite. It should be replicable in versions of the game up to 1.1.2, which is the version I tested it on and can confirm it works.

If you want a video guide to follow, the earliest video I can find of the glitch is from YouTube channel No Hypothesis. YouTuber Austin John Plays has a thorough guide too, in which he notes where things could go wrong.

There, the actor was joined on stage by fellow Witcher stars Freya Allan, Anya Chalotra, and Joey Batey to discuss the show's upcoming third season, which will apparently feature "a very shocking death". Also, those of us who have not read the books are going to be "blown away" by season three's "big bad". 


But, of course, what most people wanted to hear about was Cavill's departure from the show, something he announced towards the end of last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chad Stahelski, director of the upcoming Ghost of Tsushima film adaptation, has stated he is looking for ways to "leave [the film] open to expand further from there".


Stahelski made the comments in an interview with Comic Book Movie to promote John Wick: Chapter 4's release on Blu-ray.


The adaptation of Ghost of Tsushima was announced in 2021 with Stahelski as its director, and Takashi Doscher was named as its writer in 2022. Since then, Stahelski has stated the adaptation will be "a complete Japanese cast, in Japanese" with Sony on-board backing his choice.

Last November, producer Naoki Yoshida addressed the lack of diversity in an interview, and the response did little to assuage the concerns of Black and minority ethnic players.

That's according to Diablo 4's game director, Joe Shely, who confirmed on a recent fireside chat that whilst it may feel as though players are rocketing through the story campaign, the truth is that most players are taking their time, albeit "playing through content much more quickly".

"The significant majority of our players haven't finished the game yet," Shely said in the livestreamed discussion. "But many of the people who are watching this stream, and our dedicated players, play through content much more quickly and have been experiencing this situation with the dungeons."

This means a delay of around a year from Flintlock's previously-expected "early 2023" arrival.


Set to release for PC, PlayStation and Xbox, this "magic meets gunpowder technology" fantasy action RPG made an impression when it was shown at the Xbox Games Showcase 2022. (Chalk this up as another title not to make that showcase's 'released in the next 12 months' promise).

Mod team member Isatris has now created a mod that adds Hunter weapons and armour from Bloodborne into the demo of the pinocchio Soulslike (thanks PCGamesN). The integration, visually at least, is a harmonious blend.


It's not quite Bloodborne on PC, though, as much as fans might be thirsting for it. The mod only changes outfits so Lies of P gameplay remains intact - don't expect any guns!

"They are hard at work on updates and continued content for Redfall," Booty continued, saying he wanted to "support them to be able to keep working to deliver the game they had in mind".

Earlier this month, it was reported that animation studio Illumination was on the cusp of finalising a "big deal" with Nintendo to adapt its Legend of Zelda series. However, Illumination's CEO has now spoken out to damp down fan expectation.


Speaking to The Wrap, Chris Meledandri - who founded Illumination back in 2007 - said he didn't know where this Legend of Zelda report came from.

The original Moving Out arrived back in 2020, reimagining the process of furniture removals in much the same chaotic way Overcooked reimagined culinary creation. And while the end result wasn't "quite as good" as its obvious inspiration, as Eurogamer's Christian Donlan suggested in his review at the time, it was "still very special".


A extremely solid foundation, then, for more to come, and Moving Out 2 builds on the original by whisking the Furniture Arrangement and Relocation Technicians (F.A.R.Ts) "beyond the realms of their dimension" and into a succession of "wildly different" universes.

Not much has been heard from Houser since his departure from Rockstar following an "extended break", but rumblings of a return emerged last year when it was discovered he'd registered companies Absurd Ventures and Absurd Ventures in Games in both the US and UK.


And now, Houser's new project has been officially revealed, with Absurd Ventures being described as a media company with a focus on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium".

Despite that shift in focus, Booty says the company still plans to "maintain support" for Xbox One by making its Gen 9 titles - that is, games designed specifically for Xbox Series X/S - playable on the older platform via its cloud streaming technology.

"Like the best luchadores in the business," Eurogamer's Christian Donlan wrote at the time of its release, "Guacamelee has real heart and a blazing desire to put on a good show."

The unassuming asset in question, found squirrelled away on Square Enix's support site (and which you can peruse at your leisure over on RPGSite), features a logo for a presumably unannounced title going by the name Star Ocean: The Second Story R.


While Square is yet to utter the name publicly, it's not hard to conclude it references an unannounced remaster, given it uses the same naming convention as Star Ocean: First Departure R. That game, which released for Switch and PlayStation in 2019, was a remaster of 1998 PlayStation Portable game Star Ocean: First Departure (itself a remaster of the 1996 Super Famicom original), introducing the likes of difficulty rebalancing and new character art.

This has included mechs, trucks, tanks and Korok torture devices. Someone even built a pilotable T-rex, because why not.


A month on, however, these in-game designs have evolved even further, and we are seeing Zonai-crafted orchestras and functioning calculators turn up in the game. 


As a quick reminder, Link's new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects to create something completely new and unique.

Aired at 5am UK time, the 11-minute video offers little in the way of actual updates amongst its silliness. We get another trailer for the upcoming Shadows of the Damned Remastered and, right at the end, the sneakiest of peeks at what's next from renowned game maker Suda51.


Looking closely at the gameplay footage (which Suda51 pretends to block to stop us seeing more), there's a UI which shows health, blood and "emerald flowsion". One of the weapons equipped is named "Brynhildr".

In both games, players are shown 16 clues which must be categorised into four groups of four. Once a category is correctly identified, the clues are grouped together at the top of the board and asasigned a colour.


The only notable difference is that Connections refreshes each day and players can only make four mistakes (akin to Wordle), whilst in the Connecting Wall (as it's known on Only Connect) players must solve the wall in two and a half minutes. Connecting Wall players have unlimited guesses until they've found two categories, after which they are only given three incorrect attempts.

This update sees the arrival of a redesigned in-game overlay, complete with new features, a notes function, pinnable in-game windows and improvements to notifications.


The ability to pin windows from the overlay means they appear on top of a game while you are still playing. This feature, the company has said, is available for Notes, Guides, Discussions, Achievements, and the web browser, so  is ideal for those "multi-tasking maniacs who love to have a movie on in the background while they game".

Speaking with Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation's head of subscriptions Nick Maguire said putting games on to the service "a bit later in the life cycle" is working for Sony. Therefore, this will "continue to be [its] strategy moving forward."


"We're happy with our strategy," Maguire told the publication. "Putting games in a bit later in the life cycle has meant that we can reach more customers 12, 18, 24 months after they have released."

When Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth was revealed at last week's Xbox Games Showcase, many (myself included) believed it was a completely new game being announced in the series, and not the sequel to 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon. 

However, following subtle rewording of its marketing for the game, RGG Studio and publisher Sega explained that Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is actually the title for Like a Dragon 8, which was initially announced under that name in September last year.

Just when it looked like it would be all hands on deck until the arrival of Sea of Thieves' hugely anticipated (by me, I am the huge anticipant) Monkey Island crossover, developer Rare has announced it'll be reviving the multiplayer pirate game's limited-time Adventure series next week after a three-month absence.


Sea of Thieves' Adventures were introduced early last year in an effort to create meatier, more interesting monthly content drops, with the idea being each would form a playable instalment in an ongoing narrative. It's been fun following along, even if their quality has varied wildly (and even if they resulted in the sacrifice of moustachioed seahunk Arthur Pendragon, which is a crime I will never forgive), but then Rare suddenly announced it would be temporarily "hitting the pause button" on Adventures back in March.


Whatever the reason for the pause (presumably the impending arrival of a certain G-brush), Rare is finally ready to resume monthly Adventures, starting with next week's A Dark Deception, which runs from Thursday, 22nd June to Thursday, 6th July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People Can Fly, the studio behind Bullestorm and Ourtriders, has formally signed a work-for-hire agreement with Microsoft to develop a new project based on one of the Xbox maker's IP.


The announcement come via a statement posted to Polish financial site Interia Biznes, in which People Can Fly notes the game, which has been given the codename Project Maverick, will be fully funded by Microsoft with a budget of $30m-50m.


As to what the mystery project could be, the most obvious guess would be some form of new entry in the Gears of War series given the studio's previous connections with the franchise - it co-developed Gears of War: Judgment alongside its previous owner Epic Games in 2013, and was responsible for the Windows port of the original Gears of War prior to that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells - the superb rogue-like action-platformer from Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire - is being turned into an 10-episode animated series for release next year.


The series is the work of Paris-based animation studio Bobbypills - the team behind Dead Cells' animated trailers, as well as Ubisoft's upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon spinoff, Captain Laserhawk - and whisks viewers away to a cursed island ravaged by a strange plague. 


"After the island's foolish king develops a remedy that ends up turning the population into monstrous creatures," the official announcement explains, "prophecies depicting a flame-headed hero begin to appear. As it so happens this beheaded hero is real, but saving a kingdom isn't on his schedule and he just wants to be left alone."

There's no release date as yet, just word that Sony is "testing" the technology for select PS5 titles, including those in the subscription's game catalogue, and others you may own. 


And to be clear, this will be a Premium tier benefit - so you won't get it if you're on regular old PlayStation Plus Essential or Extra.

With the Great War over, you command a legion of Czech soldiers on a train bound for home via the Trans-Siberian railway. Their aim is to get back to the newly-created republic, but along the way there's trouble - the Russian Civil War.


Real-time battles are interspersed with management of your soldiers while aboard the train - which can of course be upgraded as you journey through Siberia - making sure your units are in good health and well fed.

"We wanted to create something that really resonated with a lot of people," Yoshida said previously. "And when we saw how Game of Thrones, and before that the Song of Ice and Fire series, has really resonated with players, we knew that this was something that we wanted to do as well."


The development team were required to watch the Game of Thrones Blu-ray boxset in order to keep the series' style front-of-mind - something that is now apparent more than ever. Did George RR Martin secretly pop over to the Square Enix office while writing lore sheets for Elden Ring?

A new trailer gives a look at the various ghost hunting tools that will be in our arsenal, including ouija boards, crucifixes and those blacklight glow stick things that I am sure have a proper name but I can't think of it right now. It is all suitably spooky, as you can see for yourself below.

"We've had some fun, but we wanted to make sure it felt authentic to the gothic, dark themes we had. And because of that, there's no secret level in Diablo 4 that people might be looking for, as per previous games."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Federal Trade Commission has suceeded in getting a temporary ban placed on Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout bid.


Word of the FTC's intent to file an injunction first broke on Monday this week. The development blocks Microsoft from making any kind of move on Activision Blizzard, and brings the matter to a federal court. 


The FTC had previously set its own date for the deal to be debated by an internal administrative judge on 2nd August - after Microsoft's own deadline to complete the merger on 18th July expires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt has confirmed players will be able to skip straight to Phantom Liberty in Cyberpunk 2077, as long as it's unlocked in the story.


Gabe Amatangelo, game director and VP of the studio, further confirmed at which point the expansion unlocks and revealed there will be a new ending of the base game.


"No, this takes place in the midst of [Cyberpunk 2077]," Amatangelo told WCCFTech. "You get to a certain point in the game and this unlocks, but of course, we let you skip right to it much like it was done in The Witcher 3's expansions."

Summer Game Fest is currently in its fourth consecutive year - having initially started amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as a response to major in-person gaming events being shut down - and 2023's offering has been bigger than ever.


It was, of course, originally expected to have some competition from the returning E3 this year, but after that show's cancellation, Summer Game Fest swelled to fill the gap, hoovering up a number of publisher showcases and events under the Summer Game Fest banner.

PowerWash Simulator's SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack was announced back in May but, beyond its Bikini Bottom setting, developer FuturLab didn't give much away.


Now, though, with a release in sight, the studio is finally ready to share more, confirming its Spongebob DLC will feature a mini campaign split across six new maps: Conch Street, The Bikini Bottom Bus, The Krusty Krab, The Patty Wagon, The Invisible Boatmobile, and The Mermalair.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long old wait for developer Slow Bros' gorgeous stop-motion-style space adventure Harold Halibut - but now, some seven years after its initial reveal, an end is in almost sight, with its Xbox, PlayStation, and PC release set for "early" next year.


Harold Halibut tells the story of a young lab assistant (the Harold of the title) forced to live his life onboard the Fedora, a city sized spaceship still submerged beneath an alien ocean 250 years after it fled Earth to preserve the human race.


While some of its inhabitants have reconciled themselves to a life on the sunken ship, others still works tirelessly to find a way to leave the planet and reach a new, dryer home. Harold's story lies somewhere between all that, told in absolutely sumptuous style, part fully voiced stop-motion movie, part narrative-driven adventure.

The Lamplighters League unfolds in an alternative version of the 1930s, where players - taking control of the titular organisation's gang of misfits and scoundrels - travel the world in an effort to thwart the Banished Court cult's nefarious schemes.


It's an adventure that'll swoop from dockyards and other urban corners to far more exotic locales, including deserts and jungles. Here, players must battle the Banished Court's army using a mix of real-time infiltration, stealth, turn-based tactical combat, and team management.

Everything included in Hi-Fi Rush's new Arcade Challenge update (as it's officially known) will only be available after beating the base game. Once that's done, a new arcade cabinet is added to the hideout, unlocking the new BPM Rush and Power up! Tower up! modes.


BPM Rush presents players with a series of encounters where the beat gets faster and faster as enemies are defeated, gradually rising all the way up to 200BPM. Tango notes that while this new addition is really designed for players in search of a tougher challenge, it'll actually feature an Easy and Casual difficulty setting too so everyone can give it a try.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed heavy metal rhythm shooter Metal: Hellsinger is taking a tilt toward pop in its new Essential Hits Pack DLC, which launches today on Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


Metal: Hellsinger's FPS action, if you've not yet made its acquaintance, sees players traversing eight musically infused Hells, armed with a blade and an appropriately devastating assortment of guns. The twist, though, is enemies take way more damage when an attack lands on the beat, turning its demon slaughter into wonderfully satisfying dance of bullets and steel.


To date, all music in Metal: Hellsinger and its earlier DLC has been firmly in the realm of heavy metal and written specifically for the game. However, its newly revealed Essential Hits Pack DLC sets its sights on a different crowd, taking things in a poppier direction with eight licensed tracks that can replace the base game's existing tunes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're back to wrap up the end of a tiring but intriguing week of Summer Game Fest and not-E3 announcements, which offered us the usual mixed bag of presentations, CG trailers, and the occaisonal musical interlude.

What were our favourites? There was a real variety of things on offer, from Dont Nod's Jusant and Compulsion's stylish-looking South of Midnight to blockbusters like Star Wars Outlaws and Fable. And then, of course, there was the inescapable Starfield - which after nearly a full hour deep dive I still feel like we've only seen a small portion.
Microsoft did well, I thought. Ubisoft did pretty good. Capcom... put in an appearance to delay Pragmata. But what were our favourite games on offer, and how convinced were we by Todd Howard's marketing spiel? Joining me to discuss all that are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

But while Nix is adorable and I've taken to calling him my land axolotl, the character that really caught the internet's attention was a certain droid commando, ND-5. Twitter, Tumblr, I've seen you.
The reactions to ND-5 I've seen are mostly "friends, please don't be horny for the Star Wars droid" or "friends, I am horny for the Star Wars droid". You either get it or you don't. So please, let me at least try to explain why the internet is horny for the Star Wars droid.

Speaking via an investor call held in the wake of today's announcement that it would restructure the company, Embracer's newly-promoted interim exec Matthew Karch said the business must now prioritise pumping out Lord of the Rings projects ahead of other game ideas which might not perform as well. 


"We own Lord of the Rings, and we know we need to be exploiting Lord of the Rings in a very significant fashion and turning that into one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world," Karch said. "And that's obviously something we're going to be doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioWare has removed a bizarre statue of Mass Effect's dying Commander Shepard from its online store, following fan confusion and upset.
The statue appeared on the BioWare Gear Store yesterday, and features (yes, you guessed it) the dead female body of Commander Shepard floating around in space as seen in the opening to Mass Effect 2. The statue was priced at $135 and its store page stated only 2000 would be available worldwide.
Needless to say, a statue suddenly being sold that depicts a dying character is a bit odd to begin with. The posing of FemShep is also a bit much - why the slightly arched back? Out of context, it looks a bit like Shepard's death is being sexualised and fetishised. And why only FemShep? What about if I want a statue of male Shepard limply floating about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer has announced a "comprehensive restructuring program" which will result in studio closures, project cancellations and job losses.


The Swedish umbrella company has grown enormously through acquisitions over the past five years, and now owns a swathe of studios such as Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics, Borderlands maker Gearbox, rights to franchises such as The Lord of the Rings, and an array of other publishers such as Plaion, Saber and THQ Nordic.


But while amassing its empire, Embracer is yet to see a big return. Last year's big bet, its Saints Row reboot, was a critical and commercial failure. More recently, the company suffered a body blow when a major unannounced $2bn deal fell through, prompting its shares to plummet by an eye-watering 40 percent.

Ghost Trick, if you're unfamiliar, comes from Ace Attorney designer Shu Takumi and follows the adventures of Sissel, a sharp-dressing amnesiac who's surprised to wake up extremely and unequivocally dead at the start of the game.


On the plus side, Sissel's quickly learns his newfound spirit form grants him the ability to possess inanimate objects, enabling him to influence events and, in gameplay terms, progress to the next portion of Ghost Trick's wonderfully told story.

Tonight, during the Capcom Showcase, the publisher confirmed we'd need to wait longer once more - though we did get another teaser beforehand. You can watch that below:

Redfall released to a less-than-stellar reception back in May, with Digital Foundry calling the Xbox version a "sad tale of unfulfilled potential and profound technical issues", while its PC counterpart was so hampered by poor performance, technical problems, and bugs, Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia said there was the sense it "just isn't finished".


Launch was bad enough that Xbox boss Phil Spencer took the step of apologising to players, admitting, "We let a lot of people down this week", leaving many to wonder how - and if - Arkane Austin could turn things around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly set to file an injunction with a federal court in an effort to temporarily halt Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


The FTC sued to block Microsoft's proposed deal back in December, claiming it would allow the company to suppress its games industry competition. The hearing for that case - which will be deliberated by the FTC's own internal administrative law judge - is set for 2nd August, after Microsoft's 18th July merger deadline expires.


As reported by CNBC, citing a source familiar with the matter, the FTC is now taking steps to prevent Microsoft's Activision Blizzard deal from going ahead before its internal hearing can take place, by filing for an injunction with a US District Court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XDefiant, Ubisoft's upcoming Tom-Clancy-inspired free-to-play shooter, is holding its first Open Session test later this month on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.


XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division - was initially announced as Tom Clancy's XDefiant back in 2021, but Ubisoft chose to drop the Tom Clancy branding after criticism from fans that felt its flamboyant action strayed too far from the franchise's more serious military themes and formula.


Development has quietly continued since then, with Ubisoft occasionally opening XDefiant up to registered "insiders" to canvas feedback, and a recent closed beta finally brought the game into the hands of a much broader audience, with over 1m players ultimately getting to spend some time with its first-person shooting action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight's Ubisoft Forward has given us a closer look at the trio of Assassin's Creed titles set to launch in 2023, including the Baghdad-set Assassin's Creed Mirage, VR title Assassin's Creed Nexus and smartphone entry Assassin's Creed: Codename Jade.


We began with a look at Assassin's Creed Nexus, which is due to launch for Meta Quest 2. Tonight provided our first real detail of the game, including the fact it will star three of the series' best-loved protagonists: Ezio, Kassandra and Connor.


Nexus will boast a "full single-player campaign", Ubisoft said, with an Abstergo-set modern day threat revolving around the evil tech company trying to use people's memories to sway their behaviour - and even their voting preferences. It's perhaps a bold choice of narrative for a game set to be played on Mark Zuckerburg-branded hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost exactly two years to the day of its original announced, Netflix's exuberant animated Far Cry adaptation, Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, has received its first trailer.


Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix comes from series creator and writer Adi Shankar - who helped bring Netflix's acclaimed Castlevania adaptation to life - and is described as a "love letter from the 90s". 


Unless its story has changed dramatically since its unveiling in 2021, it all takes place in parallel version of Earth where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data. Enter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier, who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before sailing off into the sunset with his boyfriend Alex.

Accompanying this news, Ubisoft shared a gameplay overview trailer for the upcoming release. It transports us to the franchise's never-before-seen Western Frontier, and covers things such as skill upgrades, mounts (you will be able to tame your own banshee) and introduces some of the game's new Na'vi clans. 


It all looks rather Far Cry (our Na'vi has weapons training) with a dash of Horizon Forbidden West, if you ask me, but I will let you judge for yourself below.

Shadow Gambit's top-down tactical action - which should be immediately familiar to fans of Mimimi Games' previous titles - unfolds in a "dynamic, immersive sandbox" given an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. It sees players climbing board their living ghost ship, The Red Marley, to explore the Caribbean in an alternative version of the Golden Age of Piracy.


As they set out in search of the legendary Captain Mordechai's lost treasure, with the Inquisition of the Burning Maiden in pursuit, they'll gradually acquire a crew of cursed pirates with supernatural powers that can be assembled into teams for use in missions around the world.

We likely know the full schedule for tonight, with two just-revealed titles set to get a more thorough showing. Those, of course, are Star Wars Outlaws from Division studio Massive, unveiled last night at Xbox Games Showcase, and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which we got a glimpse of at Summer Game Fest. 


It's a Ubisoft show, so there'll be some Assassin's Creed. We're looking forward to seeing more of the upcoming back-to-basics Mirage, and potentially some of VR game Nexus and Ancient China-set mobile entry Jade. Then there's likely to be Forza Horizon-like The Crew Motorfest, plus the latest release date for Skull and Bones.

Hazel is also Black, something that narrative producer and creative specialist James Lewis lamented is "unfortunately... still pretty unique for video games". 


Thankfully, the South of Midnight developer has ensured its Black heroine was created by Black women and women of colour, calling this inclusion "key for understanding and writing Hazel's voice."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14889">New research</a> suggests that AIs can produce perfectly secure steganographic images:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Steganography is the practice of encoding secret information into innocuous content in such a manner that an adversarial third party would not realize that there is hidden meaning. While this problem has classically been studied in security literature, recent advances in generative models have led to a shared interest among security and machine learning researchers in developing scalable steganography techniques. In this work, we show that a steganography procedure is perfectly secure under Cachin (1998)&#8217;s information theoretic-model of steganography if and only if it is induced by a coupling. Furthermore, we show that, among perfectly secure procedures, a procedure is maximally efficient if and only if it is induced by a minimum entropy coupling. These insights yield what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography algorithms to achieve perfect security guarantees with non-trivial efficiency; additionally, these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical validation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three modern baselines&#8212;arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping&#8212;using GPT-2, WaveRNN, and Image Transformer as communication channels. We find that the minimum entropy coupling-based approach achieves superior encoding efficiency, despite its stronger security constraints. In aggregate, these results suggest that it may be natural to view information-theoretic steganography through the lens of minimum entropy coupling...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Microsoft Flight Simulator head Jorg Neumann initially spoke of the studio's plans to support the 2020 version of the sim for a decade back in 2019, a year prior to its release, and it's a stance that's been reiterated intermittently ever since. As such, there was much confusion among fans following last night's Xbox Games Showcase reveal of a standalone sequel for 2024 - particularly as Neumann had already hinted at some of its flagship new features, including cargo delivery jobs, in relation to the current sim.


Now though, in an effort to quell confusion and de-escalate mounting controversy, Neumann has offered clarification on continued support for the 2020 release in a FAQ posted on the Flight Simulator website, beginning with the reiteration that Flight Simulator 2024 is a "standalone simulator and the next-generation sequel" and not an update for the existing game.

The similarities did not escape the eye of Twitter user Butmac, who said they produced the trailers for BioShock Infinite which were released in the run-up to the game's launch in 2013.

Ebenezer Scrooge and the Invisible World is a side-scrolling platform adventure with something of a Doctor Who Christmas special to it, while the art style gives me vibes of Forgotton Anne. 


Scrooge - acting here as the protagonist and good guy - must jump and fight his way across London to fight wealthy industrialist Caspar Malthus, a press release reveals, using "a team of spectral allies" to fight Malthus' own private guard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has made a selection of its retro games playable in-browser to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary.

The games can be found by visiting Capcom Town, a website set up specifically for the anniversary and which was first teased back in March.

The site acts as a hub for all the different franchises Capcom owns, and you can hover over all the pins to find links to websites for each. There's also plenty of Capcom's most famous characters dotted around - I'm particularly enjoying watching Jill Valentine strolling around in horror as she's followed by Nemesis and his huge rocket launcher.

Persona 3 was re-released as Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable: the former included a new playable epilogue, while the latter included a new female protagonist, the ability to directly control party members, and other major changes.


However, this won't be included in Reload as the development team focus on "recreating the Persona 3 experience".

The team has dubbed this stage as "chaotic", and I can understand why. This level will see players coming face to face with "seemingly endless corridors, flying paintings" and, my personal favourite, "a gameshow-like spinning wheel that triggers random events". 


There is also a new pick up known as GoldFinger, and if you didn't read that and immediately start singing Shirley Bassey then, I am sorry, but I am not sure we can remain friends. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.

This is the project previously referred to internally as Project Belfry, and was revealed in the Xbox Games Showcase last night as coming from both Stoic and Xbox Game Studios. The suggestion is it won't be coming to other consoles. 


After some new apocalypse razes humanity's cities, survivors accumulate in the Belfry, a towering windmill that looks like something from the Moomins.

On Xbox Series X, it will run at 4K resolution. On Xbox Series S, it will run at 1440p. 


Speaking to IGN, Howard said Starfield sometimes ran at 60fps in development on console, but that Bethesda had taken the decision to lock its framerate because "we prefer the consistency".


"I think it'll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for," Howard said. "Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen."

"[I] feel very good about launching Hi-Fi Rush, we have Minecraft Legends out there which is doing well, we have Age of Empires continuing to come to console... and then as we saw today, this fall we have Forza Motorsport and Starfield."

This particular Sleeper has been hiding out in the Starward Belt at the edge of the Helion System, and, having rewritten their own code in an effort to escape servitude, is now on the run with a malfunctioning body, a bounty on their head, and no memory of their past.

There were the steampunk machines, the gleaming statues and overhead skyrails, the alternate history Americana. The first-person visuals and chunky golden guns didn't help things either. 


But no, this is the completely legally distinct Clockwork Revolution, from Wasteland 3 developer InXile Entertainment, and this "vibrant steam-powered metropolis" is named Avalon.

Publisher Paradox Interactive officially unveiled the sequel back in March, calling it a "revolutionary" spin on the acclaimed 2015 original and the "most open-ended city-building sandbox on the planet". Other than talk of a "fully-realised transport and economy systems", however, specifics remained pretty thin.


Courtesy of tonight's Xbox Games Showcase, though, we've now had our first proper look at Cities: Skylines 2 in action, with Colossal Order showing off a sequel that notably ramps up the realism, in terms of visuals at least.

Anyway, continuing this theme, Life is Strange developer Don't Nod's new Jusant looks absolutely stellar.


It's a sci-fi climbing game, by the looks of it, in which a young hero climbs endless mountain walls with a funny little creature for company. There looks to be puzzling, interaction with mountain communities, a range of surfaces to climb on, and a sprinkling of futuristic stuff. And at one point you ride a mushroom.


The sense of place - and the lighting, cor - is just wonderful. And the game's due out in 2023. Cannot wait for this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout 76's next expansion will take Bethesda's game to Atlantic City, the spiritual home of Monopoly, according to a nifty animated trailer that dropped during Xbox's summer showcase.


The video announced that after Appalachia had welcomed 15 million dwellers, Atlantic City beckons. New Jersey's pleasure city was invoked with a lot of gambling imagery and a neat riff on one of Springsteen's greatest songs, which I enjoyed at least.


Not much else to say at the moment, but the game is "coming soon". If you get a chance, do dust off Nebraska, which is one of the Boss' finest.

It is all rather chilling, with Xbox proclaiming that viewers will be able to "Sink deep into the next chapter of Senua's story" thanks to the trailer's "cinematic immersion,  beautifully realised visuals and encapsulating sound from the team at Ninja Theory". 


It really is quite something, I have to say.  The footage for this trailer, which you can see below, was captured on Xbox Series X.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Like a Dragon game has just been announced at Xbox Games Showcase. This time, starring Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga called Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. 
I'm not sure what's happening, neither is Ichiban, but the trailer and title of the game are exactly the kind of frivolous fun we've come to expect from the Like a Dragon series. The trailer shows a very naked Ichiban waking up on a beach somewhere in America. I don't know either, pals.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is slated for an early 2024 release on Xbox and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years of furiously willing it into existence has paid off! Monkey Island is finally FINALLY coming to Sea of Thieves in a major story crossover starting on 20th July this year.


It's not a complete surprise, of course; Rare first teased a Monkey Island crossover for Sea of Thieves back in 2021, tucked in a tiny corner of the game's Pirates of the Caribbean adventure. And now self-proclaimed mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood and friends will be getting similar treatment across three brand-new Tall Tales.


Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island - as the crossover is officially known - begins on Mêlée Island, where Threepwood is inexplicably receiving adulation from his peers. What follows is a "love-letter to the classic adventure game" that'll feature a host of familiar faces, including Murray, LeChuck, and more.

It's like Asobo sat down and brainstormed every use for a plane that's not just flying from A to B, and worked to put it in Microsoft Flight Sim. The list is frankly astonishing, and includes:


Aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, air ambulance, crop dusting, mountain rescue, skydive aviation, aerial construction, cargo transport, VIP charter service, air racing, glider pilot, scientific research, low altitude training, experimental trips, executive transport service, airship tours and hot air balloon trips.

The developer behind Spiritfarer and Sundered has been working on 33 Immortals, a top-down action-RPG roguelite with a delicate hand-painted art style and co-op for 33 players. What?!


It looks like a fascinating piece of work, with a delicate, rather serious tone, sonorous choral music, and delicate animation. But also: 33 players in an action-RPG! Based on a bit of gameplay, 33 Immortals won't scrimp when it comes to throwing loads of enemies your way, and there was a lovely bullet hell element to some of the spells going off.


33 Immortals will be released in 2024 for Xbox X/S, and will appear day one on Game Pass.

Cue scenes with Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters, people frozen in carbonite, and at least one Hutt.

"This is a brand new classic Sonic Game that's been developed," Iizuka-san said, via translator, "and in order to recreate that classic Sonic gameplay, we needed someone who understands the classic Sonic series and understands that gameplay format, in order to really execute well on the final product."
"And so we're working together, with Naoto Ohshima-san, who is the creator of Sonic the Hedgehog and was there at Sonic 1, creating and developing the game. We're working with Ooshima-san and his team at Arzest, they're leading development on the title and they're doing a great job of making a brand new classic Sonic game."

"We're in the midst of this writers' strike, and so everything has been paused and on hold for the right reasons," Pratt told Entertainment Tonight.

Outside of Asia, the situation is less clear. Local versions of the official website for the UK and USA omit any mention of a physical release, and simply point to digital storefronts for the game on all formats - PC, PlayStation and Xbox.

Now, Ubisoft has revealed a further option that nods all the way back to Assassin's Creed 1 (which, I'm slightly alarmed to acknowledge, is now nearing its 16th birthday).


Where Mirage's colour palette is all golden sunrays and splashes of crimson, the original AC1 had a much bluer filter. To me, it pointed to the fact your historical adventures were all just a simulation - similar to the green palette employed in The Matrix films.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go developer Niantic has said it will act to improve the game's quality levels, after a recent snafu left players spending time and money hunting rare Shiny Pokémon with far lower-than-expected odds. 


The bug, which Niantic previously told Eurogamer was an "unfortunate technical error", was eventually fixed by the developer only after fans worked to crowdsource data and diagnose the problem for themselves.


It was the latest in a string of issues which seem to regularly affect the hugely-successful mobile app, with the  release of Pokémon and the launch of in-game events frequently marred by some problem or other - particularly in early timezones such as New Zealand and Australia, where it is now a running joke in the game's community that players act as unofficial beta testers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blasphemous 2, the sequel to developer The Game Kitchen gorgeously grim 2019 action-platformer, finally has a release date and is heading to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC on 24th August this year.


Like its enormously enjoyable predecessor, Blasphemous 2 is part Metroidvania, part Souls-like, marrying a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling imagery.


Blasphemous 2 sees the return of pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One in an adventure set across a unfamiliar land - a labyrinthine new kingdom promising a "series of enchantingly grotesque landscapes", and ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

Released all the way back in 2013, Payday 2 sees teams of up to four players turning to a life of crime, embarking on a career of increasingly outlandish heists across Washington DC.


Payday 2's development officially ceased at the end of 2018, amid financial difficulties for Overkill's parent company Starbreeze, but the game recieved a surprise resurrection the following year, and updates of various sizes have continued to release since then.
