        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maggie Robertson, known for her towering roles in both Resident Evil Village and God of War Ragnarök, is set to play Orin the Red in Baldur's Gate 3.


While we have known about her inclusion for a while now, with developer Larian confirming it to our Bertie earlier in the month, her magical, menace of a character had remained largely under wraps until now. However, new details have now been released about this "grandmaster of murder".


In a new video, Robertson introduced her upcoming villain as "affectionately unhinged", revealing that players won't know when she is about to pop up in Balder's Gate 3 thanks to her shapeshifting abilities. In fact,  Orin is able to take the form of anyone - "perhaps even someone in your camp".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ratata Arts has released a new Ratatan gameplay trailer, to whet appetites for the rhythm strategy game.


The developer said Ratatan's gameplay will incorporate a "unique combination of rhythm and strategy", and see players taking on the role of a conductor. This conductor has the very important job of controlling an army of the titular Ratatan, which will be able to "attack, defend and support" as they march against other armies in the game. 


Additionally, these music loving animal-like creatures will be able to "gather 'Cobuns' that can chant, move and attack according to the instructions". As a result of all this musical mayhem, the developer has promised "one massive rhythmic showdown!" You can see how it all looks in the video below.

The presentation gave us another chance to see the harrowing environments we will be presented with on release. We will be able to explore Axiom, the realm of the living, and Umbral, the realm of the dead.


Each of these realms will have their own enemies, characters, treasures and the like. One example of an enemy in Umbral was a rather unusual head with arms and legs, but no body. This chap is known as a 'Mendacious Visage', and I certainly wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night (although, that is probably exactly what will happen whenever I play the game). There was also another enemy that reminded me of Silent Hill's Pyramid Head.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We demonstrate how images and sounds can be used for indirect prompt and instruction injection in multi-modal LLMs. An attacker generates an adversarial perturbation corresponding to the prompt and blends it into an image or audio recording. When the user asks the (unmodified, benign) model about the perturbed image or audio, the perturbation steers the model to output the attacker-chosen text and/or make the subsequent dialog follow the attacker&#8217;s instruction. We illustrate this attack with several proof-of-concept examples targeting LLaVa and PandaGPT...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Along with all the expected accoutrements such as new maps and weapons, the team also revealed its lineup of upcoming operators. These include Snoop Dogg, Nicki Minaj and 21 Savage, who all join Call of Duty as part of a 50-year celebration of Hip Hop over the course of the season. 


Snoop Dog has previously appeared in Call of Duty, and keeping with tradition is set to be "ready for any operation, whether it's going under Deep Cover or going in guns blazin'..." After all, as the Call of Duty team explained: "At the end of the day, it's a Doggy Dogg World, and we're living in it."

To put that into context, this is better than the total boxed sales of Pikmin's three previous Japanese launch weeks combined: with 101k sales for Pikmin 1 and 161k first week sales of Pikmin 2 - both on the GameCube - and 92k first week sales of Pikmin 3 on Wii U.


These numbers from Japanese sales company Famitsu (via VGC) paint a rosy picture, although the comparisons here come with caveats - for instance, that Switch has a far higher userbase than either GameCube or Wii U - and this game has seen heavy promotion in Japan in particular.

As laid out in the case's legal documents, this dispute all comes from a 19-second audio clip that originated from a video Fantano uploaded about those aforementioned pizza slices.


In this TikTok clip from 2021, Fantano reacts to a video of someone else cutting a pizza up into smaller and smaller pieces. "It's enough slices!", the exasperated Fantano shouts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday saw the release of Desert Treasure 2 - The Fallen Empire in Old School RuneScape - the MMO's first Grandmaster quest since 2019.
A sequel to the classic Desert Treasure quest released back in 2005, Desert Treasure 2 - The Fallen Empire sends players back to the depths of the Kharidian Desert to explore a vault connected to the fallen Zarosian empire where they'll once again get caught in the plans of the mysterious Mahjarrat. 
As many RuneScape players will know, the lore in Old School RuneScape frequently deviates from the stories told in its modern counterpart due to its being created from an August 2007 archive. This means any quests released after this date, King's Ransom being the last, are not present in Old School RuneScape, allowing the developers to not only craft stories unique to Old School, but to take the ones which overlap in a different direction.

Brewed up by First 4 Figures, the figurine consists of the giant operatic turd mid song opposite a mini Conker throwing toilet roll into its mouth.


If you're not familiar with the vocal work of the Great Mighty Poo, the boss is arguably Rare's Magnum opus and is battled inside a giant turd mountain in the infamous N64 classic.

This demake comes from DooMero, and is known as the Resident Evil 4 2D Edition. It was created on GZDoom, an engine and modding tool often used for various Doom creations. In fact, the DooMero has dedicated their creation to the Doom community. 


Earlier this week the creator uploaded a 30 minute video showing the opening moments of their Resident Evil 4 demake. It all starts as you would expect, with Leon Kennedy (and his lovely jacket) searching for the president's daughter in the unnamed rural village in Spain.

The idea behind this was to give players smaller rewards, where in previous games a reward was given only once all Chaos Emeralds are acquired (usually Super Sonic).

Gaming revenue overall increased by 1% ($36m) driven by growth in Xbox content and services, but this was offset by the decline in console sales. Content and services revenue increased by five percent due to third-party content and Xbox Game Pass.


Indeed, the company set a new fourth quarter record for monthly active Game Pass users and engagement.

Word of a follow up to 2020's mythological romp first surfaced last year, when it was reported a game was in the pre-production stages, with Ubisoft hiring for the title. Subsequent reports then suggested this game would not, in fact, be a fully fledged sequel, but rather a spin-off with a Hawaiian Polynesian theme.


Now it seems the company has decided to pull the plug on this project all together. Sources familiar with Immortals Fenyx Rising's supposed sequel told VGC the Quebec studio's game is no longer in the works due to "perceived challenges around establishing the IP". Allegedly, Ubisoft instead wants to shift its focus to its "most prominent brands".

The upcoming Chrono Trigger inspired retro RPG from Sabotage Studio will launch on 29th August, when it will also be available on Xbox Game Pass, as well as Switch and PC. 


The impending launch of Sea of Stars on PlayStation Plus is notable, as Sony seldom releases games day one on its subscription service. To date, only a handful of other titles have been included as part of PS Plus on their release, such as Stray and Tchia. Meanwhile, the company has said it still won't put new first-party games on PlayStation Plus day one.

As reported by GamesRadar, asd8dhd on Reddit has spent 200 hours trawling through the various gameplay clips, trailers, and other Starfild-focused media to create what they believe will be the game's complete skill tree.


"I must have watched the direct in its entirety around 50-60 times, often at ultra-slow speeds in order to capture specific details and verify certain information. I have also watched other videos and interviews many times, and have typed up enough notes to last me about 100 years," the Redditor shared along with their theories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Entertainment Software Rating Board has proposed a new verification mechanism which it says will ensure parental consent is properly obtained under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule (COPPA).

The board, which regulates age ratings for games in the US and Canada, has developed the mechanism with Yoti, a digital ID platform, and SuperAwesome, a company specialising in online child safety tools. SuperAwesome was acquired by Epic Games in 2020.

According to COPPA, services in the US must gain parental consent to collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The ERSB's proposal, titled "Privacy-Protective Facial Age Estimation", would use facial recognition software to verify the age of the parent. If their estimated age is lower than the threshold (given as 25 in the proposal), they would not be allowed to provide consent for the child.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has proudly announced the "first ever" pizza-scented Xbox wireless controllers, as part of a collaboration with the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie called Mutant Mayhem.

The controller has four different designs - one for each of the titular turtles - but more importantly each will come with a "built-in scent diffuser" in the shape of a pizza slice.

Thankfully (or sadly, if you're a fan of TMNT and/or desire the constant smell of pizza in your life) the controller is only available through a giveaway being hosted by Xbox. In order to enter, you'll need to follow Xbox Game Pass on Twitter and retweet its sweepstakes tweet which, at time of writing, isn't live yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside the confirmation of which characters will appear in Mortal Kombat 1's first DLC, three more playable characters have been confirmed.
Long-time characters Baraka, Tanya, and Li Mei are all returning to the main roster of the reboot. Whilst Baraka was playable in the most recent game in the series, Mortal Kombat 11, Tanya last appeared as a playable character in Mortal Kombat 10 as DLC. Li Mei, despite appearing as a NPC in Mortal Kombat 10, hasn't been playable since 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.
Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has discussed some of the differences in these characters' stories in this rebooted universe. Baraka and Mileena's teeth are not because they're a part of the Tarkatan race, Boon stated in an interview with IGN, but due to a disease called Tarkat. Li Mei is now a constable of the Outworld, Boon revealed in an interview with GameSpot, and is responsible for the protection of Mileena, princess and heir to the throne.

As part of a behind the scenes video, the development team at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft shared more insight into the planets that we will be able to explore on the game's release. This includes everybody's favourite desert with two suns, Tatooine. 


The development team showed work in progress images of this sandy destination, including a close up of Han Solo frozen in carbonite, before cutting to the oversized and slug-like crime lord Jabba the Hutt looming over him. Additionally, work in progress stills showed Outlaws' protagonist Kay Vess approaching Jabba's Palace.

In a candid fireside chat, key members of the Diablo 4 team said that they "acknowledge everyone's feedback", admitting that whilst the goal was to slow down players "blasting through the content", the nerfs had the opposite effect of what the team had intended, which had been to "make the game more fun for players".

"We want to acknowledge everyone's feedback in regard to reducing player power," said community manager, Adam Fletcher. "We know it is bad. We know it is not fun... We also want to talk about what we were trying to achieve specifically with this patch and with the changes that players ended up seeing.

"Sea of Thieves: Voyage of Legends replicates and reimagines aspects of the video game to create an authentic tabletop experience," the team at Steamforged says. "The goal for Steamforged was to seamlessly blend Voyage of Legends with the Sea of Thieves environment, making the game board, cards, and tokens feel at home on a tavern table in an outpost. The board game itself serves as a familiar hub where players can track their progress and house the various cards needed to become a pirate legend."

"At Frictional, we work on games holistically. This plays a crucial part in how our games look and feel. While all of our games have been horror in some way, what we really try to do is to get a kind of 'playable immersion'," Grip said. "Horror games naturally are where emotions are front and centre.

In the latest earnings call with investors, Guillemot was asked by an investor for his view on the merger and his decision for Ubisoft to remain independent while the industry consolidates.


"I think it's good news that the transaction can go through because it's really showing the power of IPs and where the industry is going. So, there will be lots of opportunities in the future for all the companies," Guillemot replied.

The Elder Scrolls Online likely needs no introduction, not least because all the pertinent details are right there in the title. If you're still struggling though, it's an MMO - first released in 2014 - that whisks players to Tamriel for some fantasy japery.


If dragon nonsense isn't your thing, then your other option is Murder by Numbers, a lovely blend of campy detective mystery and - of all things - Picross, as players whizz back to the mid-90s in the role of Honor Mizhari, an actress on a hit TV detective show who's suddenly required to do some real-world investigating when her boss is found dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly preparing to pause its upcoming in-house trial focussing on Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard, potentially paving the way for settlement talks between the various parties.


The FTC has long expressed opposition to Microsoft's proposed deal and sued to block its progress in December last year, claiming the acquisition would allow the company to suppress its games industry competition. The agency has more recently been in the news after it failed to secure an injunction preventing Microsoft from closing the deal while its in-house court deliberated whether the acquisition should be blocked.


Following that defeat, and a subsequent failed attempt to secure injunctive relief, the FTC is preparing to suspend its own trial - which was due to be heard by its in-house administrative court in August - in response to a request from Microsoft and Activision. Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the case, says the request must be granted after the FTC's unsuccessful federal court bid under the agency's own rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a first look back in May, Sony Pictures Entertainment has shared a second trailer offering another glimpse at its Neill Blomkamp directed Gran Turismo movie - which is almost upon us, launching in cinemas next month.


Sony's live-action Gran Turismo movie was announced in spring last year, as part of a string of reveals for upcoming PlayStation game adaptations, with others including a Horizon Zero Dawn series for Netflix and a God of War show for Amazon.


Since then, Neill Blomkamp (who directed District 9, Elysium, Chappie, and more) has signed up to helm the project - which dramatises the true story of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills put him on the path toward becoming a professional racecar driver - with the likes of Archie Madekwe, David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Geri Halliwell all joining the cast.

In a blog post, developer Niantic said Pokémon Go players can begin exploring Routes "now" by following tracks laid down by other Trainers (though the ability to add new Routes yourself is "still being rolled out").


Routes are Pokémon Go's first major dabble with user-generated content, and are designed to be short paths for players to follow, suggested by members of local communities.

The emulator was first announced to be coming to Steam earlier this year, with the team behind it calling this a "product of many months of work".

However, a few months down the line, the team has dropped plans to launch Dolphin on Valve's platform. In a blog update detailing this decision, the Dolphin team addressed the recently-reported DMCA takedown, stating Nintendo "did not send Valve or Dolphin a Digital Millennium Copyright Act", nor has it "taken any legal action against Dolphin Emulator or Valve".

Described by Strange Scaffold as a "third-person love letter to classic shooters", the game tasks players, as protagonist James Savage, with battling various supernatural enemies whilst descending through 50 floors of a motel to hunt down Draculae, the lord of vampires and Savage's former lover. The Max Payne era of shooters is cited as the main inspiration for the game.

The release date was announced with an animated music video for Stay Awake, a song from the game's hip-hop soundtrack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Sleep players with access to the game's £50 Pokémon Go Plus+ peripheral are pretending to sleep in order to quickly speed towards Pokémon Go rewards. 


The new nap-tracking app requires you record at least 90 minutes of sleep per day - and it's this minimum which users are now recording, before manually changing the date on their phones to then record another 90 minutes, and so forth. 


Repeating this method allows you to rack up rewards for recording a week's worth of sleep (albeit no less than 90 minutes at a time) in just a few hours, users writing on Pokémon fan reddit TheSilphRoad say. And doing so seems fairly straightforward, with the app's sleep sensor simply turned off and on without you actually having to be asleep.

Despite scooping the prize for Excellence in Design at the Independent Games Festival in 2020, the game made a relatively small splash when it first released last year for PC.
Patrick's Parabox is a sokoban mixed with recursion, filled with boxes inside of boxes. You play as Patrick, a small box, and you push around boxes to where they need to go. Sometimes, you push around boxes which contain the puzzle you're actually in, and then you can enter that box. The trailer below probably sums it up better than I could in words.

<blockquote><p>So far, at least three trends emerge:</p>
<p>First, the plan contains a (somewhat) more concrete list of actions than its parent strategy, with useful delineation of lead and supporting agencies, as well as timelines aplenty. By assigning each action a designated lead and timeline, and by including a new nominal section (6) focused entirely on assessing effectiveness and continued iteration, the ONCD suggests that this is not so much a standalone text as the framework for an annual, crucially iterative policy process. That many of the milestones are still hazy might be less important than the commitment. the administration has made to revisit this plan annually, allowing the ONCD team to leverage their unique combination of topical depth and budgetary review authority...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 recently made headlines when it was reported the game would have 17,000 ending variations. It's a claim that comes from an interview with one of the game's lead writers by YouTuber Fextralife, and related specifically to the differences which might flavour the more general core paths to the game's ending.


Lead writer Adam Smith has now shed further light on these variations, and further confirmed they don't  equate to endgame states. Rather, Baldur's Gate 3's narrative should be thought of as a "big spider web", he said, with the endgame in the centre. 


"It's not that you start at point A, and then you keep branching and branching and branching," Smith explained to GamesRadar. "That's often how people think of it, but the problem with that would be that if I make a choice, then I branch over here, and suddenly I'm over here and I can't get back [to the trunk]."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's controversial crackdown on password sharing has, in the short term at least, provided the streaming service with a new subscriber boost.


Subscriptions were up by 5.9m since March, BBC News reported, presenting a far rosier picture than the losses faced this time last year.


In a statement, Netflix said it had seen a "healthy conversion of borrower households" into paid accounts, and that the number of account cancellations in protest at the changes had been low.

In the world of Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard's latest financial earnings report has arrived, and while it's good news for the company as a whole, Blizzard in particular has had a stellar quarter, surpassing $1bn USD in net bookings for the first time ever thanks to the launch of Diablo 4.


In its second quarter earnings report for the latest financial year, Activision Blizzard announced 50% year-over-year growth in net bookings, with the company amassing $2.46bn compared to the $1.64bn it reported in the second quarter of 2022.


That's down to a mix of increased "player investment in live operations content" across games such as Call of Duty, which rose by 17%, and "another quarterly net bookings record at King". The big applause, though, is reserved for Diablo 4, which, as of the end of Blizzard's record-breaking second quarter - which saw the studio's segment revenue grow by 160% year-over-year and its operating revenue more than triple - has "sold-through more units than any other Blizzard title at an equivalent stage of release."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard is taking its first tentative steps away from Battle.net exclusivity, starting with the launch of Overwatch 2 on Steam this August and the promise of more games on the way.


Battle.net has been at the core of Blizzard's games since its release back in 1996, and the studio's PC titles have remained exclusively available through the platform in the years since, making it one of the few companies to have entirely snubbed Steam.


That will change on 10th August when Blizzard's free-to-play shooter sequel Overwatch 2 arrives on Valve's storefront, where it'll incorporate native features including Steam Achievements and Steam friends list integration. And perhaps we might even see official Steam Deck support on the way? Blizzard does note, however, that players will still be required to connect the game to a Battle.net account to enable features including cross-platform play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of Sonic Boom. I know, that might be controversial. Sonic fans have long debated which Sonic CD soundtrack is best between the Japanese and American releases. 


For the opening at least, I've always loved the American version: Sonic Boom. The chugging electric guitars! The earworm vocal harmonies! The key shift from verse to chorus! Japan's You Can Do Anything is a funky 90s bop that just sounds inherently Sonic, while Sonic Boom set the tone for the later rock-heavy Sonic Adventure games. I prefer that classic 90s sound overall but something about "Sonic boooom Sonic boooom" gets me so excited for another high-speed adventure - what can I say, I like the cheese.


All of which is to say, I love the Sonic animation intros. And the just-released intro for Sega's forthcoming Sonic Superstars is hitting all the right notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Supreme Court has denied the latest effort by a group of gamers to block Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition. 


In December last year, a group of 10 gamers teamed up to file a federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. The case aimed to argue that Microsoft's acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision would "foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition".


In March, a judge dismissed the "so-called gamers' lawsuit" on the grounds it did not "plausibly allege the merger creates a reasonable probability of anticompetitive effects in any relevant market".

Scrolling through the hefty patch notes there are a number of buffs and debuffs across all classes, but the biggest impact is on the Sorcerer that's been nerfed.


That's due to a reduction in bonus damage for the Devouring Blaze skill, a popular choice for many playing as that class.

Depending on the categories of sleep players manage to achieve during their downtime - "dozing", "snoozing" or "slumbering", for instance - they're able to attract different sets of Pokémon, and the whole process is overseen by new Pokémon professor, Neroli.

In the latest instalment of Nintendo's Ask The Developer series of interviews, Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto spoke alongside former series directors Shigefumi Hino and Masamichi Abe, as well as programmer Yuji Kando and designer Junji Morii on the origins of the series. 
Hino revealed initially the team had planned to feature creatures with AI chips in their heads in the first Pikmin game, and players would be able to control them by assigning different chips. The concept art for this prototype was shown, and the early Pikmin would have looked like round creatures with limbs, a nose, eyes, and an antenna.

<blockquote><p>The group got the idea for the conings by chance. The person claims a few of them walking together one night saw a cone on the hood of an AV, which appeared disabled. They weren&#8217;t sure at the time which came first; perhaps someone had placed the cone on the AV&#8217;s hood to signify it was disabled rather than the other way around. But, it gave them an idea, and when they tested it, they found that a cone on a hood renders the vehicles little more than a multi-ton hunk of useless metal. The group suspects the cone partially blocks the LIDAR detectors on the roof of the car, in much the same way that a human driver wouldn&#8217;t be able to safely drive with a cone on the hood. But there is no human inside to get out and simply remove the cone, so the car is stuck...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft fans have spotted an intriguing addition to the veteran MMO that's distinctly themed around Fortnite. 


Datamined details of an upcoming boss encounter scooped up by Wowhead reveal the abilities of a new "Renegade Looter" enemy to include "Cranking 90s", "One Pump", "Slurp Drink" and "Disco Bomb". For the uninitiated, all of these are references to Epic Games' ever-popular battle royale. 


Cranking 90s, for example, refers to the player ability to build a vertical tower at speed. In World of Warcraft, it will allow the Renegade Looter boss to "rapidly construct a tower to gain the high ground".

Barone confirmed the update was in development back in June 2022, though at the time described it as largely a "modding-focused update". While suggesting update 1.6 will have some new content, Barone was clear it would not have as much as 1.5, added back in December 2020.

Now, Barone has shared a fresh update on what's coming to Stardew Valley in 1.6 that sounds more promising - prompting excitment from fans at what's in store.

The CMA officially blocked Microsoft's proposed $69BN acquisition of Activision Blizzard back in April, highlighting concerns relating to the fledgling cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk "stifling competition in this growing market".


However, following the US Federal Trade Commission's failure to secure a temporarily halt on the deal in court last week, the CMA indicated it would be open to a "new merger investigation" if Microsoft was willing to restructure its Activision Blizzard deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 developer Starbreeze Studios has released a new trailer showcasing its upcoming heist shooter's stealth gameplay. Unfortunately, it released it so sneakily, it went undiscovered for five days and the studio ended up having to tell everyone where it'd hidden it.


In a moment of perhaps misguided whimsy, someone at Starbreeze (thanks PC Gamer) thought it would be a fun idea to hide its new trailer in appropriately stealthy fashion by squirrelling it behind the existing trailer on the Payday 3 website - so that it only popped into view when the volume slider was turned all the way down or when the site was visited in Incognito mode.


Starbreeze began to realise it might have been a bit too sneaky when, some five days later, the trailer still lay undiscovered. And so - after an initial, ultimately failed prompt on Twitter - the studio turned, somewhat inexplicably, to the medium of exceptionally bad poetry in a desperate bid to nudge fans in the right direction.

Announced last September, Codename Jade is a fully fledged open-world Assassin's Creed game set in second century BC China (placing it chronologically between Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Origins) and featuring the Qin dynasty.


Players create their own character - the adopted child of master Wei Yu - in Codename Jade, eventually embarking on a quest for revenge after their close friend is betrayed. "But as they delve deeper into their mission," Ubisoft teases, "they will uncover secrets about the past and a powerful force that threatens to destroy everything they hold dear."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think it's obvious when something has been created out of love. Maybe it's in the garnish delicately placed atop fluffy, steaming rice. Maybe it's in the subtle differences you see on a living room wall as it reflects the passage of time.

In the case of Venba, it's both. If you've played the demo, the care and attention to detail of the game's opening level is clear. Now I've seen more, courtesy of a preview presentation and roundtable interview with game designer and creative director Abhi. I came away appreciating how Venba wears its heart on its sleeve, regardless of whether or not you pick up on every single reference.

Venba takes place across three decades, and follows the story of a couple - Venba and her husband Paavalan - after they've emigrated from South India to Canada. Venba touches on themes of immigration, family, culture and assimilation, and food is the language it uses to navigate these conversations.

This comes as part of new regulation laid out by the Council of the European Union which aims to "regulate the entire life cycle of batteries" to ensure they are "safe, sustainable and competitive". 


The idea is batteries are easier to replace and recycle, with a guarantee that "portable batteries incorporated into appliances should be removable and replaceable by the end-user" within new devices from 2027 onwards.

Whilst that may not sound impressive given the PUBG: Battlegrounds' record-breaking peak currently sits at a hefty 3.2m players, it's important to note that even though TF2 is widely considered one of the greatest shooters of all time, it's just about to turn 16 years old.

According to SteamDB, the game has never been more popular, not even when it switched from a premium to a free-to-play model in 2011. And the most recent record of 253,997 concurrent players more than doubles the prior record of 167,591, which was set back in December 2022.

That's according to a recent Payday 2 livestream with Almir Listo, Starbreeze's global brand director, who confirmed the news whilst fielding questions from fans about the upcoming shooter. You can watch the answer yourself at the 9m 17s point in the video below:

When asked if Payday 3 will have "an offline mode, like playing solo", Almir replied: "No. You will be able to play it by yourself, but I do believe you will have to have a connection in order to play because it's made in the Unreal Engine, it's using cross-progression, [and] cross-play. I do believe we need you to be online."

In a Twitter thread, Pagliarulo acknowledged that while fans "have tons of questions" and they were "humbled" by the interest in the highly-anticipated title, neither they nor anyone else on the team is able to speak about the game – including its content or performance – because they signed an NDA and "don't want to get fired". 

"I know this isn't what any Starfield fan wants to hear from me, but I feel like I need to make this clear: no one other than Todd Howard himself is authorised to talk publicly about unreleased game info. That's the job of of our PR/marketing/community folks," Pagliarulo said in the thread, which was also shared with the game's subreddit.

"The motion for injunctive relief is denied," the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals filing states. "The existing briefing schedule remains in effect."

Nichiporchik (as reported by WhyNowGaming) was speaking at this week's Develop: Brighton conference, in a talk titled 'AI in Gamedev: Is My Job Safe?' which promised an "in-depth [look] into how [TinyBuild] adopted AI in daily practices to exponentially increase efficiency".


One part of the presentation in particular, focusing on "AI for HR", has proved especially contentious since news of its contents began to spread around the internet. Here, Nichiporchik discussed how AI could be used by HR to spot burnout (later described as being synonymous with "toxicity") among employees by first identifying "potential problematic team members" then collating and running their Slack messages and automatic transcriptions from the likes of Google Meet and Zoom through Chat GPT, in a process he terms "I, Me Analysis".

Haptics firm Owo's Mirage-themed tie-in has been created in partnership with Ubisoft and looks something like an extremely snug short-sleeved shirt, albeit packaged alongside various bits of hardware. While wearing one, players can experience "multiple different sensations" that reflect those of Assasson's Creed Mirage's protagonist Basim.


Owo says these "sensations" will include the likes of "impacts and parkour", with the standard version of the haptic suit able to mimic 30 different sensations, including "axe", "insect bites", "severe abdominal wound", and "ball".

Hryb has been with Microsoft since early 2001, initially serving as editor-in-chief for MSN Music before joining the company's Xbox division two years later. As a senior product manager for Xbox, Hryb was focused on helping shape the Xbox Live community experience - he credits himself as being a key contributor in features such as Xbox's Achievement system and party chat - and would go on to become senior director of corporate communications in 2012.


Over the years, Major Nelson - a name derived form Hryb's Gamertag - has been something of a figurehead for Xbox, relaying Xbox-Live-related information to the community and having a prominent presence in its various community focused blogs, livestreams, podcasts, and shows.

The original Lunar Lander (perhaps the most famous entry in a sub-genre that can be traced back as far as 1969) was exquisite in its compelling simplicity, requiring players to do nothing more than carefully park their lunar landing module at a fixed point on the Moon's rugged terrain - by manipulating their craft's thrusters and controlling its orientation.


Dream Uncorporated's reimagining, though, which will be known as Lunar Lander: Beyond, is looking to do something a little bit different, taking the moon landing premise of the arcade original and infusing it with a "rich back story" and "deep narrative". There's also talk of "simulation" and "precision gravity flier mechanics" in the studio's announcement.

miHoYo's statement to Eurogamer suggests it is only learning of the situation now, and that the missing payments were the fault of a local recording studio which it has now "immediately urged" to sort the situation. 

Indeed, miHoYo says it is now "also seeking alternative solutions" to resolve the matter - and presumably make sure it never happens again.

A new trailer for the game was shown at the recent Annapurna Showcase, but with its abstract aesthetic it's difficult to ascertain exactly how the game will play.



That was intentional, however. "We aim to try to raise questions, instead of answering them," said game director Simon Flesser. "We want to make viewers wonder, and think."

There were a few questionable faces in there, admittedly, with Brazilian Womens' legend Miranda looking quietly terrifying up in the top left, and Ronaldino not quite at his best, but the biggest standout was Andrea Pirlo, the iconic now-retired Italian holding midfielder. 


Pirlo looks especially out of place because unlike everyone else in the group shot, he's just wearing a plain, unbranded blue t-shirt amongst a sea of official kits. He's also staring blankly into space, leading to plenty of comments joking he looked a little lost.

Indeed, creative director Marcus Smith stated in an official PlayStation video that the game's dimensional rift hopping "would not have been possible without the Solid State Drive of the PlayStation 5".

Xbox's Tim Stuart said Microsoft had forecasted PlayStation sales in order to evaluate the impact of making ZeniMax games exclusive. Ultimately, the company believed it could "offset losses incurred from making ZeniMax games exclusive through Game Pass and increased console sales".

As such, the CMA will take another six weeks to consider the new submission, with this revised period ending 29th August.

He'll be hanging up his sword and locks of white in the show's upcoming Season 3 Volume 2, which Netlix is now teasing in a newly released trailer.


Season 3 of Netflix's wonky The Witcher adaptation kicked off with five new episodes at the end of June, and it'll come to a close with the release of three more episodes on 27th July.


And as for what's in store, lots of special effects, overwrought emotion, and a whole heap of action judging by Netflix's new Volume 2 trailer, which also manages to chuck in a unicorn and far too much of Jaskier's terrible Season 3 haircut for my liking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After developer Larian shifted the release date of Baldur's Gate 3 forward a month to avoid clashing with Bethesda's highly anticipated Starfield, Dragon Age creator David Gaider's roleplaying musical Stray Gods is now moving back a week to avoid Baldur's Gate 3.


Stray Gods (subtitled The Roleplaying Musical for the benefit of those with leaky genre brain) was originally due to launch on 3rd August, but Summerfall Studios - where Gaider is co-founder and creative director - has now revised its release date to 10th August, explaining, "We want everyone to have ample space to check out Stray Gods when it launches. Baldur’s Gate 3 is hotly anticipated (by us, too!) and we want to give our fans room to celebrate Stray Gods."


However, it seems Larian's fantasy epic isn't the only reason for Stray Gods' short delay; Summerfall calls releasing the game across Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC simultaneously a "huge undertaking for any team, let alone an indie shipping its first title" and says the extra week "allows us to have performance parity as close as possible - across every platform."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Call of Duty is still awaiting its official reveal, but that hasn't stopped an actor - who claims his likeness is being used for a main role in next year's instalment - from revealing what may well be the first story details for Call of Duty 2024.


As spotted by Insider Gaming, actor and singer Luke Charles Stafford recently shared a post on Facebook claiming Activision would be using his likeness for "their next main character" in a Call of Duty apparently set to release "next year".


"Activision decided to adapt their next main character, 'Ratcliffe' for Call of Duty off my face/likeness, and I am elated," Stafford wrote. "To all of my college roommate back at Anderson University and those years in Smith Hall Playing Black Ops 2... Next year, we can beat the snot out of each other again, but I want to play as me."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has finally whipped back the veil of secrecy around its FIFA replacement EA Sports FC in cash-splashing style, revealing a whole heap of new league licensing deals, new gameplay details, and (as widely expected) a release date of 29th September this year.


EA Sports FC24 is, of course, EA's first major football outing without the FIFA brand, which the publisher announced it was ditching last May. Since then, we've been introduced to EA Sports FC's official logo (it's a triangle made of letters with a triangle in it), and, more recently, had a reveal for the game's premium-priced Ultimate Edition cover. Which was a tad unsettling.


Today, though, it's all go on the EA Sports FC24 news front, as EA aimed to convince of its continuing place in football with a flashy, no-expenses-spared showcase featuring the likes Alex Scott, Didier Drogba, Luís Figo, Ronaldinho, Leah Williams, and Erling Haaland - who'll feature on the cover of EA Sports FC24's Standard Edition.

The latest line of Pikmin merch on the UK and Ireland website for My Nintendo Store comes in the form of bud vases, a vase for a single flower, in the shape of Pikmin.
It's an adorable idea, as you can put a leaf, bud, or open flower in to make the Pikmin look how they do in-game. You can even branch out and put different varieties of flowers in, taking some inspiration from the mobile Pokémon Go-like game Pikmin Bloom.

Today, Dont Nod has announced a release date along with a new trailer which gives a few more hints about the game's plot. The video below shows the perspective of Charles Davenport, a friend of the protagonists who seems to blame himself for what has happened to them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch recently unveiled its new Partner Plus programme that offers an improved revenue split, but streamers have now described to Eurogamer it as "anti-community".


The programme was announced last month for launch in October, and is set to offer a 70/30 revenue split - higher than the usual 50/50 between streamers and Twitch. However, the criteria for this higher revenue split is very specific, meaning few streamers will likely reach the necessary requirements.



Speaking to Eurogamer at TwitchCon Paris, many Twitch Partners criticised the programme and stated its threshold was unattainable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox maker Microsoft has said it is "disappointed" to see the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launch a formal appeal to try and overturn this week's bombshell court decision.


Following months of legal wrangling a US judge cleared the way for Microsoft to complete its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, after deciding the FTC had not sufficiently proven why it should be blocked. 


The FTC, as had been expected, is now appealing this decision - and has already filed to begin the process as quickly as possible.

This move comes just days after Microsoft won its case against the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in its ongoing bid to buy the Call of Duty maker - something the FTC has now said it will appeal.


American based stock exchange Nasdaq announced that another company would join the Nasdaq-100 Index in the coming days, replacing Activision Blizzard in the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown, the latest instalment in the open-world racing series, has been delayed again, and is now due to arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Switch in "early 2024". In better news, its long-promised closed beta begins later this month.


Solar Crown - which ambitiously promises a full digital recreation of Hong Kong Island and its 550km of roads to recklessly careern around - got its official unveiling back in 2020, and was originally expected to launch across all platforms in September last year.


However, as May 2022 rolled around, publisher Nacon announced it was shifting Solar Crown's release back to some undisclosed point in 2023, and confirmed it was ceasing development of the previously announced PS4 and Xbox One versions "with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles and maximising the overall quality of the game".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Controversial game platform Roblox is adding support for Meta Quest VR headsets.


Reports that Roblox was coming to Meta Quest first surfaced earlier this year, when sources told The Verge the move would likely happen toward the end of 2023. It now seems those estimates were a little off; today's confirmation of incoming Meta Quest support doesn't provide an exact launch date, but it does reveal an open beta will be added to Meta Quest's App Lab "soon".


In an official announcement on the Roblox developer forum, the company explained, "Traditionally, developing a VR experience required a team that had VR-specific experience and skills. With Roblox, developers will soon be able to publish their existing experiences to support VR with little to no additional coding effort required. This is because Roblox is designed to be universal, allowing the same experiences to run everywhere."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed its next batch of Game Catalogue additions for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, which, as of 18th July, will include the likes of It Takes Two, Undertale, World War Z, The Ascent, and - for Premium retro fans - Twisted Metal 1 and 2.


It Takes Two (PS4, PS5) is one of July's big draws, serving up some acclaimed co-op platform action as Cody and May, two parents-turned-toys on the edge of a divorce, must battle against the odds to return to the real-world. The Game Catalogue version includes a Friend's Pass, meaning someone who has the game can invite a friend who doesn't to play for free.


It's joined by Neon Giant's absolutely gorgeous top-down cyberpunk action-shooter RPG The Ascent (PS4, PS5); Saber Interactive's well-received four-play co-op zombie slayer World War Z (PS4, PS5); Toby Fox's cult favourite RPG Undertale (PS4); extreme off-road action in SnowRunner (PS4, PS5), and long-distance tactical blasting in Sniper Elite 5 (PS4, PS5).

According to Bailly, a "Need for Speed: Most Wanted Remake is being release in 2024", and we can surmise it's a new version of EA Vancouver's 2005 original rather than developer Criterion Games' 2012 racer of the same name, as Bailly says she'll once again be starring as the "partner" of protagonist Sergeant Jonathan Cross.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Horizon Forbidden West team considered cutting flying from the game, because it wasn't sure the PlayStation 4 hardware could support it. 


Chatting at Develop:Brighton earlier today, studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said Guerrilla faced technical challenges when developing the Zero Dawn sequel, as it was releasing across two generations of consoles. 


"It was almost up until the last moment that we didn't know whether we could support the flying on PlayStation 4," the developer said (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). "We were like, 'Do we need to cut the whole feature of the game? That's going to make such a mess'."

The feature, available to Xbox Insiders for now, will allow players to capture a 60-second video clip of an in-game voice chat and submit to the Xbox Safety Team for review.


The safety team will then evaluate the user report to determine if a policy violation has taken place, with an updated notification feature detailing to the player that submitted the outcome of the report and the reasoning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to this week's milestone court decision which clears the way for Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal in the US, and potentially in the UK as well.

We discuss why the court sided with Microsoft and what is likely to happen next, including what remedies Microsoft may be considering to get the deal over the line with the UK as well. Could we see a future where the UK lacks Call of Duty streaming on Game Pass? Or any form of streaming via Game Pass altogether?
Finally, we ponder the games industry's next steps in general. Will the sale of Activision Blizzard further open the floodgates to yet more acquisitions? And how will Sony counter? Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has suggested a "new merger investigation" into Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard is not out of the question, following Microsoft's court case win against the US Federal Trade Commission yesterday. 


The CMA has remained an outlier in Microsoft's ongoing bid to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard, being one of the only bodies to oppose the deal. 


In April, the CMA cited concerns over the deal's proposed impact on the cloud gaming sector as its reason for blocking the acquisition, stating Microsoft's ownership of Activision Blizzard risked "stifling competition in this growing market".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's currently a question mark hanging over the Xbox versions of Baldur's Gate 3. They are happening but they're held up by Xbox Series S, which is struggling to run split-screen co-op at an acceptable performance standard.
An added complication is that Microsoft wants feature parity across the Series X and S versions of the games - so much so there's a suggestion Larian would not be able to release one Xbox version of Baldur's Gate 3 with split-screen co-op, and the other without it.
The last we heard from Larian was that it was working on it, and that it was weighing up some "compromises" - the suggestion being that split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S could, potentially, be removed. So when I spoke to Larian boss Swen Vincke about this last week, I asked whether a decision had yet been made.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly "leaning toward" an appeal of yesterday's decisive court verdict that cleared the way for Microsoft to complete its Activision Blizzard acquisition in the US.


A Bloomberg report states that the FTC currently favours launching an appeal, but has just days to do so.


Microsoft cannot close the deal in the US before Friday this week, while the deal itself is set to expire next Tuesday, 18th July. It's therefore expected Microsoft will act swiftly, and seek to complete the acquisition once and for all this coming Monday.

A Borderlands movie was first announced back in 2015, but it wasn't until five years later, when Gearbox announced Hostel director Eli Roth would be directing from a script by Mazin, that the project finally appeared to be moving forward in earnest.


Things progressed quickly after Roth and Mazin's involvement was confirmed, with a succession of major acting talent - including the likes Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jack Black - all signing up to join the star-studded cast prior to the start of shooting in 2021.

Things kick off with The Making of Karateka, a historical delve into Mechner's noted martial arts game that'll combine interviews, video, design documents, audio, and photos to create what the studio is calling the "deepest, most exhaustive exploration of the making of a single video game that's ever been attempted in a video game itself."


"In The Making of Karateka," the studio explains on Xbox Wire, "you'll meet Jordan Mechner - not the legendary veteran game designer we know today, but the unknown teenage college student who was desperate to break into the video game business. Through excerpts from his college journals, galleries of his design documents, and all-new video interviews, you'll share Jordan’s struggles and triumphs as he creates a video game like no one had ever seen before."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years (well, one year and 11 months to be more precise) after its debut on Switch, PlayStation and PC, Axiom Verge 2 - the sequel to developer Thomas Happ's acclaimed retro-styled Metroid-a-like - is finally available for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.


Axiom Verge 2 builds on its 2015 predecessor's exploratory action with a quest to "discover the origins of the Axiom Verge universe", beginning as new protagonist (and billionaire owner of the Globe 3 conglomerate) Indra heads to Antarctica in search of her daughter.


Here, Indra discovers a portal to an entirely different reality - a ruined Earth-like world infected by parasitic machines - that she'll need to explore and overcome, battling deadly monsters along the way with her melee-focused abilities if she wants to survive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[West of Dead studio Upstream Arcade and publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment have given a first proper taste of Hellboy Web of Wyrd's gameplay in a brisk new trailer as the "roguelite action brawler" continues its journey toward a release on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.


Hellboy Web of Wyrd was formally announced last December, teasing an original storyline crafted in collaboration with series creator Mike Mignola, as well as a striking aesthetic designed to evoke the visuals and atmosphere of the comics.


While specifics still remain relatively sparse some six months on, we do known it'll take place in The Butterfly House, a strange residence built upon "occult ley-energies" whose many doorways lead to a "terrible and fascinating" dimension known as The Wyrd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has won its crucial court case against the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), clearing its way to acquire Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn.

Last week's courtroom battle hinged on whether the FTC could be allowed an injunction to temporarily block the deal while it investigated further. But in reality the case was viewed as a referendum on the deal's overall ability to still be successful.
Defeat in court would have left Microsoft's effort to buy the publisher behind World of Warcraft, Diablo 4 and Candy Crush dead in the water, Microsoft had previously admitted.

Twitch created a team of LGBT+ streamers from the UK and Ireland who were added to a specific Pride Month "shelf" on the front page during the month of June, though this was located beneath other recommendation feeds and lacked promotion on social media.


Speaking to Eurogamer at TwitchCon Paris, members of this team stated it wasn't beneficial and would like to see Twitch improve its support for LGBT+ streamers not just during Pride Month but throughout the year.

The remaining 13 percent can be easily accessed - whether that's through a re-release on modern platforms or through an officially provided emulation service, but the majority of older games remain unavailable through easy means.

The study was produced in order to substantiate the amount of video game history in danger of being lost, the Video Game History Foundation said, and provide evidence on why libraries and archives should be allowed to preserve games in a similar way to other media forms such as books and films.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Nihon Falcom were at one point working on a Sonic RPG for the Mega-CD console, featuring a "flirtatious and sexy" female hedgehog.


The project was known as Sister Sonic, though the character wouldn't have actually been Sonic's sister but a long lost relative and "more mature girl" with "sexy charm". No footage of the game exists.


Though the game was previously rumoured, YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming has unveiled the truth behind its development.

Wrote Larian in a community update: "Baldur's Gate 3 has more cinematic dialogue than three times all three Lord of the Rings novels combined. It has 174 hours of cinematics, making it more than twice the length of every season of Game of Thrones combined."
This, however, raised concerns over how much cinematic dialogue people would be watching while playing the game, and whether it would interrupt the flow.

Earlier this year, Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4 required players to create new characters each season. This sparked debate across the board, with many believing the decision would leave a sour taste in the mouths of Diablo 4's more casual players. 


But while controversial, this move is similar to how seasonal content worked in Diablo 2's ladders and Diablo 3's seasons. Diablo 3 did have something else going for it, however - the Rebirth feature.

A "supermajority" of 144 employees spread across marketing, localisation, product development, and quality assurance at Sega of America revealed its intention to unionise back in April, with the aim of securing higher base pay, improving benefits, and more.


At the time, the group confirmed it had contacted the National Labor Relations Board in order to file for an election, to which Sega management were said to be "investigating and considering the options available". That election has now taken place, with 91 employees voting yes and 26 voting no out of 200+ eligible employees.

This isn't our first glimpse at the Twisted Metal TV series, of course; April offered a brisk introduction to Anthony Mackie's "motor-mouthed outsider" protagonist and the tiniest tease of iconic villain Sweet Tooth (voiced by Will Arnett and played by Samoa Joe), while June showed the pair exchanging quips and violence in a follow-up clip.


And now, with launch day in sight, Peacock has released a considerably more wide-ranging looking at the action fans can expect. There are cars! Guns! Cars being shot at with guns in a shopping mall! We get a peek at post-apocalyptic San Francisco, and the rather more gnarly post-apocalypse beyond the city's walls, plus a look at Neve Campbell as Raven and Thomas Haden Church in the role of Agent Stone.

But much more importantly than that, the publisher also unveiled its first bit of cover art for the game - this one being for the premium-priced Ultimate Edition, with the standard one still to come - and it is... quite odd?
Player faces have always occupied a strangely prominent spot in FIFA fans' minds, often being one of the first things referred to when comparing differences between the latest version from EA and Konami's rival series eFootball (formerly PES).

Moore said he has "always" described Clockwork Revolution as a mix of the two, due to its "deep world building, compelling narrative, crunchy RPG systems, engaging gameplay, and massive reactivity," on Twitter.

Moore's credits include both Arcanum and Bloodlines, as he was a lead artist and designer at developer Troika Games from 1999 to 2004. On his website, Moore states he was involved in narrative, content, and character design for both games.

Nintendo Co. Ltd - the company's Japanese operation - said just 4.2 percent of its managers are women, a stat which has remained the same since it previously reported this figure in 2021. 


The average salary for a female employee is 72 percent that of an average man at Nintendo Co., the report continues (thanks, Axios).

"We wanted to avoid players having to restart the whole game, because it's a very heavy narrative experience," Pechenin said (thanks, PC Gamer). "There's a character you might meet – you will most likely meet – that will allow you reset your class, and reinvest all of the levels."

<blockquote><p>A mysterious squid-like cosmic cloud, this nebula is very faint, but also very large in planet Earth&#8217;s sky. In the image, composed with 30 hours of narrowband image data, it spans nearly three full moons toward the royal constellation Cepheus. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula&#8217;s bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue-green emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, a more recent investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Orin the Red, as the character is known, is a magical, shape-shifting menace. A sexy but sadistic presence who will appear time and time again through the game - towards the latter parts of it - to test your resolve.

The video is a short primer on what the titular Pikmin are and how they can be used in-game. The overview follows a new traveller as they meet the Pikmin and learn how to work with them.

The traveller looks on in confusion at various points, before a Pikmin confidently approaches them and instructs them to blow their whistle, or launch it towards a task to do, which got a chuckle out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yuji Naka, Sonic's co-creator and the man behind ill-fated platformer Balan Wonderworld, has been found guilty of insider trading, but will avoid prison for now.


Naka was first arrested back in November 2022 following reports of alleged insider trading at Square Enix. He pleaded guilty in March, and then, in June, the developer was sentenced to serve two and a half years in jail, with a final judgement in July.


At this time, Naka was additionally fined twice for ¥2.5m and ¥170m (just under £1m total), with his defence seeking a suspended sentence and to lower the fines. They claimed Naka "accidentally saw information that was extremely unrelated to [his] work". However, prosecutors said Naka "showed no signs of remorse" for his actions.

Known as Season of the Malignant, this season will introduce the fittingly named Malignant Monsters. These monsters are described by Blizzard as "decaying abominations" that roam through Sanctuary in a frenzy. They will not hesitate to attack anyone or anything that gets in their way. 


A new questline will focus on sorting these new foes out, with Cormond, a former priest of the Cathedral of Light, helping you on your way. He will train you to "capture the Malignant hearts" that are the source of the monsters' power, and "convert them into build-altering powers".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The steady drip of Mortal Kombat 1 info continues in the run-up to the sort-of-rebooted fighter's 19th September launch, with developer NetherRealm having now confirmed Smoke and Rain as playable characters, alongside some familiar faces returning as assistive Kameos.


Not including today's announcements, NetherRealm has so-far confirmed a total of 10 playable characters for Mortal Kombat 1: Johnny Cage, Kenshi, Kitana, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Mileena, Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung (available via pre-order), and Sub-Zero.


Two more additions have now been revealed as part of NetherRealm's latest Kombat Kast livestream. Assassin-turned-cyborg Smoke is in, marking his first playable appearance in the main series since 2011's Mortal Kombat reboot. He's joined by moody demi-god Rain, who hasn't been benched quite so long, having appeared in Mortal Kombat 11 as a DLC character.

Speaking to GameReactor at the recent Gamelab conference in Barcelona, Molyneux was reluctant to give many firm details of the game or this idea to avoid - in his words - people subsequently getting "very annoyed and angry" when their expectations of Molyneux's words are met with reality.


"In days gone by, I would just start telling you about the whole game and the whole game design and why it was going to be the most brilliant game in the world," Molyneux said. "I'm not going to do that."

Sakurai made the comments in the latest episode of Game Concepts, a series on his YouTube channel in which he discusses the development of various games.
Uprising released in 2012 for the 3DS and is the third game in the Kid Icarus series, released 21 years after the previous title Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters. A future release in the series, whether in the form of a sequel or re-release, "seems difficult", Sakurai has said.

You can now play the game for one hour, which will give you a little taster of what's in store for protagonist Jacob Lee as he negotiates the perils of the galactic prison facility he finds himself in on Jovian moon Callisto.


It is a shorter trial than previous PlayStation Plus offerings, with the likes of God of War Ragnarök giving players three hours of gameplay, but still a nice addition to the service.

Confidential Computing is a concept that has been introduced previously in the cloud-native world. The

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashback, the classic 16-bit sci-fi platformer from Delphine Software, is, as you probably already know, getting a sequel before the end of 2023, some 31 years after its original release. And new developer Microids has now offered a fresh look at Flashback 2's action - specifically the jungle-y bits - in a new trailer as it prepares for a November release.


The original Flashback, which arrived to much acclaim back in 1992 - when everything was still in black and white, and computers were powered by magic - followed the far-flung future adventures of agent Conrad B. Hart on the trail of shapeshifting aliens attempting to infiltrate human society. It was an investigation that, much like Delphine's earlier Another World, took the form of a strikingly rotoscoped platform-puzzler.


Flashback 2 (which, somewhat confusingly, isn't technically the game's first sequel, given the existence of 1995's 3D follow-up Fade to Black) sees Conrad B. Hart return for more sci-fi adventure - somewhere in the 22nd century - as he goes in search of his friend Ian. Again.

Gun announced an end for Friday the 13th: The Game back in June, confirming the asymmetrical multiplayer horror would be pulled from stores on 31st December this year, the same day its Friday the 13th licence officially expires. There's some small solace for owners, however, in that the studio has promised the game will remain playable through "at least" 31st December 2024.


And now, it's announced some new measures that, while primarily designed to "reduce the dependence on database servers", will also allow players to go about their merry slaughtering and killer-evading survival in chaotically maxed-out fashion.

And now, thanks to a new leak, we've got a good idea of when EA Sports FC will likley be showing up - which, unsurprisingly, is pretty much slap bang in the same late-September slot FIFA has occupied for the last few years.


According to data miner billbil-kun - who has a amassed a pretty compelling back catalogue of accurate calls when it comes to video game leaks (Sony's monthly PlayStation Plus line-up being a particular specialty) - EA Sports FC will release on 29th September this year.


Given that FIFA 2023 and the series entry before it both launched on 27th September in their respective release years, it's hardly a huge surprise to learn EA's new FIFA-in-all-but-name game will follow suit, but it does give us an intriguing window to watch as we prepare to see how EA Sports FC will fair without its familiar branding.

This option appears to be an alternative to the more involved Discovery Tour mode that popped up some time post-launch in Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. Perhaps befitting Mirage's more condensed nature, this option too sounds less involved.


Appropriately titled the "History of Baghdad", the option is described as being similar to the series' traditional Codex, and has been built in partnership with a series of museums and international historical institutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Destiny hurtles towards the conclusion of its decade-long storyline, Bungie has discussed how it all might end - and addressed some recent criticism of how big story revelations have been handled. 


Speaking out just a couple of weeks after the origins of Destiny's space golf ball The Traveller were finally revealed - to a somewhat mixed response - Bungie staff have defended Destiny's storytelling techniques, and said players should not expect to make allies with the game's villainous Hive.


"The Hive has still committed a lot of, you know, genocide," senior narrative designer Robert Brookes told Dexerto, pouring cold water on the Guardians and the Hive suddenly becoming besties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, we saw a God of War rip-off turn up on Xbox. Now, we have another PlayStation rip-off turning up on another console. In this case, it is Naughty Dog's The Last of Us on Nintendo Switch. 


Yes, that's right. If you head over to the eShop right now, you can get your hands on The Last Hope - Dead Zone Survival, an "intense storyline game set in an apocalyptic world overrun by hordes of ravenous zombies". Launched on 30th June, it normally costs £8.99 but is currently on sale for just 99p. 


Having played The Last Hope myself, I would advise saving your pennies for something more worthwhile. Toothpicks, perhaps. You can see a trailer for The Last Hope below (and if you were still interested in playing the game afterwards, please note there are spoilers for The Last Hope below).

The update, which became available yesterday, fixes issues relating to certain quests and various other bugs but unfortunately also prevents players from being able to make money quickly.

The methods previously reported on Eurogamer, one using thrown weapons and another using frozen meat, now do not work in version 1.2.0 of the game. I've tested this myself, and am grateful I already cashed in 40k before I updated my version.

The Butcher, an infamous enemy from the first game, can randomly spawn in any dungeon, at any level, and is a particularly nasty foe to defeat.


Reddit user IronHeart_777 discovered a giant "beast of a Butcher" while running nightmare dungeons with friends, but don't worry - it's not actually a new version of the enemy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Wildcard's less-than-elegant rollout of Ark: Survival Ascended, a full-price remaster of its 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved, continues with the news of a delay from August to October this year, and word it'll now launch without its first bit of remastered DLC.


Ark: Survival Ascended has already had a bumpy start to life; the remaster first surfaced when Studio Wildcard announced it'd be taking Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers offline later this year, and that the only way to continue using official servers would be to purchase its new Unreal Engine 5 remaster - only available as part of a bundle with the now-delayed Ark 2. Following an outcry from players, Studio Wildcard eventually announced it would scrap the bundle, instead replacing it with a standalone version of Ark: Survival Ascended that was - amazingly - exactly the same price, despite featuring one less game.


It's in this context that Studio Wildcard has now announced a delay for Ascended, saying it has "found it challenging working with Unreal Engine 5.2".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a court filing submitted as part of its legal battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed Activision Blizzard aquisition, Microsoft has claimed Sony is "expected to release" both a PlayStation 5 Slim and a "handheld version of the PS5" before the end of this year.


Both machines were referenced during a paragraph (as spotted by IGN) intended to demonstrate that Nintendo's Switch should not - as the FTC is arguing - be considered in a separate market to Xbox and PlayStation based on price. It's a point Microsoft is determined to prove so it can more effectively assert its stated position as the underdog in the console market.


As part of its argument, Microsoft notes the Xbox Series S is $50 cheaper than Switch's OLED model in the US, with the $399.99 PS5 Digital Edition being just $50 more. It's here the company first makes reference to an unannounced Sony machine, claiming the latter is "expected to release a PlayStation 5 Slim later this year at the same reduced price point."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games, Apple has submitted a filing requesting the Supreme Court overthrows a 2021 ruling made by the US district court of California, which upheld a complaint against Apple's anti-steering practices.


Epic launched its lawsuit against Apple in August 2020, following the iPhone maker's decision to revoke Epic's Fortnite developer account, preventing the battle royale game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees.


As that case reached its conclusion, California's Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in all but one of its 10 claims. However, the one ruling made in Epic's favour - that Apple cannot block developers from linking out to alternative payment methods from within their apps (a practice known as "anti-steering") - has remained a sticking point for the company.

What's more, as reported by the FT (thanks IGN), current production issues have pushed back plans for a cheaper version of the $3499 headset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Have you ever been on a crowded train with one of your best gay friends and, inside, a tiny part of you is cringing because he is being so gay?"
That's a question posed by my favourite drag queen and Ireland's self-proclaimed gender discombobulator, Panti Bliss, in a biting speech about "checking" herself. What she's "checking" is something most queer people "check" for in public, whether they realise it or not: their own queerness. Am I standing too gay? What about these colourful socks? Are they too much? Will holding a partner's arm in public turn into a problem? Something private and intimate altered into something shameful or political, all through other people's reactions. 


That feeling's best thought of as the tension between who people expect us to be and who we really are... or who we're trying to become. Imagined futures are projected onto our bodies like film reels, blurring the skin that lies beneath. That tension feels a lot like shame. But, while video games usually have all the subtlety of a sledgehammer busting through a wall, they're occasionally a great place to explore queer topics, letting us role-play as whoever we want to be or explore those unique experiences in unique ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has cancelled development of its long-in-the-works Just Cause mobile game, which had been available in regional early access - but never fully launched - since November 2021.


Just Cause: Mobile was unveiled in December 2020, during The Game Awards, where it was billed as a free-to-play action shooter set in the Just Cause universe, featuring single-player, four-player co-op, and 30-person competitive multiplayer modes.


It was originally set to launch in 2021, and, did, eventually get a release in Singapore - albeit only as regional early access title - before the year was through. Since then, Just Cause: Mobile's early access has spread to a number of other countries but development has been repeatedly hit by delays, culminating in an indefinite delay toward the end of last year and, in February, the termination of all regional early access programmes.

The developer was given a second chance to resubmit their game but said, via Reddit, that this was also rejected - due to them not owning the necessary rights. 


Now, in a statement provided to Eurogamer, Valve has clarified a few points on this post, and provided further insight into how it will police AI-generated content on Steam in general.

A fresh rating for Red Dead Redemption via the leaky Korean Ratings Board popped up last week, setting tongues wagging that Rockstar had quietly submitted a fresh version of its cowboy classic to be approved for release.

Entitled "Far Cry 1.34 Complete", the game's entire source code was uploaded to the internet archive site Archive.org at the end of June by a user called Llaetha.ro, and has since been shared across Reddit and social media.

It's unclear if the code includes any subsequent patches – although the .34 part of the 1.34 title certainly suggests so – and some commenters who've presumably downloaded and run the code believe the code is "not complete, but close".

As spotted by Dexerto (via PC Gamer), the bans come after gambling site CSGOEmpire published a spreadsheet of CS:GO traders it believed were part of a cryptocurrency money laundering scheme allegedly operating through a rival gambling site called CSGORoll. 

Whilst Valve has yet to comment on whether or not the bans were connected to the details revealed in the spreadsheet, it seems as though all but one of the accounts leaked on the spreadsheet have now been banned.

"We know a thing or two about fighting the undead," the official Twitter account for The Walking Dead responded, although neither account told us what the event will entail, nor when we can expect to play it – we've just been asked to "stay tuned for more info".

Last week, Diablo 4's lead class designer, Adam Jackson, jumped online to "clear up" the confusion around some of Diable 4's rarest unique items, and it's from Jackson that we learned the names of the six rarest ones: Andariel's Visage, Doombringer, Harlequin Crest, Melted Heart of Selig, Ring of Starless Skies, and The Grandfather.

Up until that point, some extraordinarily lucky players had discovered five of the six items, but the most elusive one, Melted Heart of Selig, was still the stuff of legend… until yesterday, it seems, when the item finally dropped for a Chinese necromancer.

"Can Jala learn to love herself and heal the wounds of her past?" the video description teases, before giving us a two-minute peek at Jala's hectic world and family life, reminding some in the comments of Edgar Wright's film adaptation of Scott Pilgrim vs The World.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the second instalment of Toby Fox's reportedly seven-part "nonviolent" RPG Deltarune steadily approaching its second anniversary, fans are understandably eager to hear when more will be on the way, and while Fox mightn't be ready to divulge that particularly bit of information yet, he has now offered a development update.


Deltarune - which charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World - launched its first chapter toward the end of 2018 as a free download. A second instalment - also free - arrived in September 2021, followed by the news a third, fourth and fifth chapter will all launch simultaneously at a later date.


The big question for Deltarune fans, though, is when, and the answer, if Fox's latest progress report is anything to go by, still sounds very much like 'not any time soon'. Fox does reveal, however, the team is currently working on Chapter 3's last overworld area - and once that's done, "the chapter will finally be playable all the way through".

News that Ubisoft has finally decided to give everyone what they more or less wanted in the first place comes via Kotaku, which claims, citing two sources familiar with the publisher's plans, that the remake is "still in its earliest stages".


Ubisoft Singapore - the same studio still trying to finish the embattled Skull and Bones - is "heavily involved" with the project, which isn't expected to complete "for at least a few years".

        <updated>2023-06-30T18:19:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment, the company behind this year's critically lambasted The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, is reportedly set to exit game development and has laid off around 25 employees as part of the move. Additionally, a second Lord of the Rings game in development at the studio is said to have been cancelled.


Daedalic's The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was announced in 2019 for release in 2021, finally arrived last month, following numerous setbacks and delays. Its reception was less-than-positive, however, with Eurogamer's Christian Donlan calling it a "well-intentioned mess" in his 1 out of 5 review. It was something of a surprise, then, when reports surfaced soon after that Daedalic was currently working on a second Lord of the Rings game.


According to German website Games Wirtschaft, however, that game - which has reportedly been in the works since mid-2022 - is no more, with development now cancelled as part of Daedalic's sudden decision to shift away from development and solely into publishing following Gollum's poor reception.

<blockquote><p>The reports on Guterres appear to contain the secretary general&#8217;s personal conversations with aides regarding diplomatic encounters. They indicate that the United States relied on spying powers granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to gather the intercepts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lots of details about different conversations in the article, which are based on classified documents leaked on Discord by Jack Teixeira.</p>
<p>There will probably a lot of faux outrage at this, but spying on foreign leaders is a perfectly legitimate use of the NSA&#8217;s capabilities and authorities. (If the NSA didn&#8217;t spy on the UN Secretary General, we should fire it and replace it with a more competent NSA.) It&#8217;s the bulk surveillance of whole populations that should outrage us...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hugely popular game platform Roblox was blocked from launching on PlayStation consoles due to concerns by Sony, it's been revealed. 


Specifically, Sony was worried about the game's popularity among children causing problems for PlayStation.


The details come from a 2022 document uncovered as part of the FTC vs Microsoft trial, spotted by Axios, in which PlayStation boss Jim Ryan discusses Roblox's absence from Sony consoles - and admits his company's stance from the game is now shifting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's lawyer made a bit of a slip last night, casually stating that "The Elder Scrolls 16" will release in 2026. Needless to say, this is incorrect.


The court case between Microsoft and the FTC came to a close yesterday, after several days of testimonies, revelations and Sharpie-related blunders. 


During the proceedings, Microsoft's lawyer took to the floor in a bid to clear up a bit of a misunderstanding surrounding Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. However, in doing so, they perhaps made things a touch more confusing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has once again addressed the Xbox version of its upcoming RPG Baldur's Gate 3, confirming that while it's still in the work, the developer may ultimately be forced to make "compromises" in order to release on the platform.


Larian's struggles with Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox first surfaced in February, when - amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive - the studio confirmed it was working on an Xbox version but that it had "run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op."


In a statement provided to Digital Foundry shortly after, Larian explained its decision not to formally announced an Xbox release was more specifically down to issues it was having getting "split-screen co-op to work to the same standard on both Xbox Series X and S". And now, in an interview with IGN, studio founder and creative director Swen Vincke has shared more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were first introduced to Pioneers of Pagonia, a new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich, earlier this year, there wasn't much to go on beyond a brief description and a teaser video. Now, though, with its early access release steadily drawing nearer, we've been given a first proper look at the thing via a new in-game trailer.


Pioneers of Pagonia, to get the fundamentals out the way, sets players loose on the titular (and procedurally generated) islands of Pagonia with the goal of establishing a presence through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover - and the alliances they forge with Pagonia's not always friendly inhabitants - along the way.


40 different building types have also been promised for Pioneers of Pagonia's Steam early access launch, along with more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. A co-op mode is also planned, meaning you'll be able to be a ruinous blight on the land (or otherwise, I suppose) with a friend in tow.

RoboCop: Rogue City - which is build around an "original story" set between RoboCop 2 and 3 - looks to land somewhere between a first-person shooter and cybernetically enhanced detective adventure, whisking players to the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit to solve crimes, slay baddies, and perhaps even turn a few wrong 'uns into goo.


"Explore open areas and complete your objectives according to your own sense of justice," explains Teyon. "Finding evidence, interrogation and maintaining public order are just some of your daily tasks as a police officer. But don't take decisions lightly: your choices can determine the fate of citizens and the result of your mission."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when it looked like we might be done with the showcases for the summer, here comes another one, this time from the ever-reliable Annapurna Interactive. And it was a typically strong showing for the publisher, offering a fresh look at some already announced titles - including the new one from Sayonara Wild Hearts' studio Simogo and the fascinating Cocoon - as well as some big reveals. From stunning photographic adventures to an honest-to-goodness new Blade Runner game, there's a lot to look forward to in the months and year ahead, and a full round-up of the showcase can be found below.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes

Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo's latest is a baroque blend of surreal mystery thriller and puzzle adenture, faintly bringing to mind the studio's iOS classic Device 6. It focuses on a woman's search for answers, deep in a strange manor house, as players attempt to solve the enigma at its heart. There's no release date yet, but we do it's coming to Switch and Steam - and while we await further details, there's a tantilising new trailer above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Microsoft argues with the Federal Trade Commission in the US over its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Canada moved to refute the Xbox maker's claims that, the FTC excluded, "all but one" regulator around the world is onboard with its deal - noting that Canada is still 'monitoring the transaction'.


As reported by The Verge, Canada's Competition Bureau has written to Judge Corley, who is currently presiding over the FTC's Activision Blizzard case in the US, to correct certain "factual inaccuracies" in Microsoft's court filings.


Microsoft had told the court that "every single worldwide regulator that has examined the deal other than the FTC has rejected" the theory it would remove Call of Duty from PlayStation should the acquisition go through, and that all regulators agreed "withholding COD from Sony would be unprofitable and is thus not a serious concern." It also claimed "all but one foreign regulator" (namely the UK's CMA) had cleared the transaction.

The company will close its recently-released NBA All-World game, end development of its upcoming Marvel World of Heroes project, and shut down its Los Angeles development studio. The news was communicated to staff via an email from company founder John Hanke, which has now been made public.


Pokémon Go, which remains lucrative, is safe. Indeed, Hanke calls it the company's "top priority" as it slims down and refocuses on the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed its Games with Gold titles for July. 


A big draw this month is Darkwood, the nightmarish survival horror game from Acid Wizard Studio, which will be available between 1st July until 31st July.

Darkwood, which originally released on PC in 2017, is a frightening horror experience that combines exploration, combat, scavenging, crafting and survival into an extremely unusual whole. Our Donlan called it "a masterclass in how to undermine the audience in tiny, gnat-bite ways" when he played it back in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we look back at a week of headlines from Microsoft's time in court arguing its case to buy Activision Blizzard with the FTC.

In the video game industry, courtroom drama does not get much bigger than this. Microsoft's Phil Spencer and Satya Nadella, Sony's Jim Ryan and Activision boss Bobby Kotick have all given evidence as the US weighs up whether to allow Xbox's enormous Call of Duty buyout to procede.
The week has brought us some eye-opening opinions from these top industry execs, as well as a treasure trove of emails to pore through - and some badly-redacted documentation. Today, we recap the biggest stories of the week, including who else was on Microsoft's studio shopping list, and why Bethesda is upset at Call of Duty not being platform exclusive. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

<p>It looks like someone redacted the documents with a black Sharpie ­ but when you scan them in, it’s easy to see some of the redactions. Oops.</p></blockquote>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4's time rewind feature is a big addition to the series, though I admit being apprehensive at first around how it might be deployed. After a week with the game - and you can read some of my early thoughts here - I've come to use it sparingly, but appreciate its existence.


As its name suggests, the feature allows you to skip backwards and undo any sudden calamity. Though in doing so, my initial fear was it risked devaluing the Pikmin series' usual high stakes.


After all, the frequent likelihood of imminent Pikmin death - their agonising squeals, the sad sight of their soul floating slowly upwards - acts to ensure you approach each situation with care.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, many claims and discoveries flying around in the wake of Microsoft's ongoing FTC lawsuit over the attempted purchase of Activision Blizzard, one particular quote stands out: PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's accusation that Xbox Game Pass and other subscription-based services are "value destructive" to video games.
Ryan, speaking in pre-recorded video testimony, also claimed other publishers "unanimously do not like Game Pass" for that reason. When pressed by Microsoft's lawyer, he added: "I talk to publishers all the time, and this is a very commonly-held view over many years by the publishers."
Talking to Eurogamer yesterday, Miles Jacobson, studio head of Sports Interactive, the Sega-owned developer of the ever-popular Football Manager series, disagreed with that quite directly.

Discussing this release reshuffle, Larian Studios exec Michael Douse explained that while the PC version was ready to go, the PS5 edition needed slightly more time, and it did not make sense to delay the former just to release at he same time as the latter.

Thanks to the retrospectively poor choice of using a Sharpie marker to redact the key information, it's easy to see the contents of these redactions now the document has been scanned.
