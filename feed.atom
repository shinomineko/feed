<blockquote><p>The idea is simple, yet previously not clearly articulated: to ensure privacy, information should be divided architecturally and institutionally such that each entity has only the information they need to perform their relevant function. Architectural decoupling entails splitting functionality for different fundamental actions in a system, such as decoupling authentication (proving who is allowed to use the network) from connectivity (establishing session state for communicating). Institutional decoupling entails splitting what information remains between non-colluding entities, such as distinct companies or network operators, or between a user and network peers. This decoupling makes service providers individually breach-proof, as they each have little or no sensitive data that can be lost to hackers. Put simply, the Decoupling Principle suggests always separating who you are from what you do...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Japanese newspaper Asahi reported today that Naka now stands accused of violating financial laws in relation to another mobile game it is claimed he had insider knowledge of - Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier.


Specifically, Naka is accused of purchasing 144.7m yen's worth of shares in its developer ATeam (worth around £865k) before The First Soldier was officially announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite continues to be a fixture of England's World Cup squad, four years after the popular battle royale's celebration dances became a common sight on Russia's pitches.


This week, England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was shown footage of himself lugging a monogrammed computer case to 2022's controversial Qatar tournament, as part of an official interview released on the England squad YouTube channel.


Pickford was asked what he was getting up to during his downtime - and, amongst other things, eventually revealed he was still hooked to Fortnite. (And no wonder - its freshly-minted Chapter 4 has reinvented the game.)

A further group of mods will be included as part of the update - now part of the game proper, with their original creators reimbursed and credited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has agreed a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo if its buyout of Activision Blizzard goes through.


Xbox boss Phil Spencer tweeted the announcement, which also confirms the company's commitment to continue to release Call of Duty games on Valve's Steam platform "simultaneously to Xbox", if the gargantuan $69 billion offer to buy Activision Blizzard is approved. Call of Duty's latest releases, Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, are already on Steam.


The announcement is a direct response to the scrutiny the acquisition has come under from a raft of organisations across the world, chief among them the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years since its initial unveiling and multiple delays later, Dead Island 2 is finally almost upon us - and ahead of its launch next April, publisher Deep Silver has shared more of its open-world, zombie-pulverising antics in a new digital showcase.


Those with itchy fast-forward fingers will be pleased to know the vast majority of Dead Island 2's 15-minute showcase is taken up by largely uninformative live-action sequences, featuring a group of zombie apocalypse survivors as they stumble across a copy of Dead Island 2 in a fancy LA mansion. It's entirely inessential fluff, but, tucked between all that, Deep Silver does manage to squeeze in a few minutes of gameplay.


Admittedly, there's little that's particularly revelatory in there - the publisher basically just used the time to reiterate the obvious fact you'll mostly be maiming various zombie types gruesomely until they're dead - but it did give us a decent new look at Dead Island 2's appealingly sun-kissed gore, as well as a taste of its weapon roster, including hammers, machetes, bear claws, a "shit-tonne of guns", and various makeshift tools of destruction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite has released its December update, bringing with it the earlier-than-anticipated arrival of a custom game browser, an updated version of Halo 3's The Pit map, and more.


Halo Infinite's new custom game browser is designed to work in tandem with the Forge Beta introduced as part of November's Winter Update. It was originally planned for release as part of next year's Season 3, but as developer 343 Industries explains in its blog post, "We fully agree with players who felt [it] should be a priority — it's a key support structure for what players create in Forge and a pillar for the community." 343 says this initial V1 release is "likely to have some rough edges" but will continue to evolve over time.


Elsewhere, today's update introduces Empyrean, a "reimagining" of Halo 3's The Pit map that's been officially rebuilt in Forge by 343. "How do Halo Infinite's toys, like its limited-use Equipment, alter some of those dynamics and affect how you traverse the combat dance floor?," the developer asks in its introduction. "Maybe the enemy team managed to grab the rockets first, but you went and acquired the Repulsor to protect yourself... We can't wait to see what new memories are forged in this proving ground!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hindsight, the acclaimed narrative adventure from developer Joel MacDonald and publisher Annapurna Interactive - in which players experience a woman's entire life, from birth to the present day - is now available on Xbox One and PlayStation. 


Hindsight is the follow-up McDonald's acclaimed iOS botanical puzzler Prune (McDonald is also a former Call of Duty designer) and tells the story of a woman revisiting her childhood home following her mother's death. As she sorts through her old belongings, she unlocks old memories that players can experience first-hand in the form of dioramas.


"Hindsight asks you to slow down and pay attention to the little things left behind," explains the game's official blurb. "Piece these things together and shift your viewpoint until you find just the right perspective to pull you deeper into the past... Linger as long as you wish, but sooner or later you must come back to the present."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors, the acclaimed minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is getting its first dollop of paid DLC next week in the form of Legacy of the Moonspell, arriving next Thursday, 15th December, on Xbox and PC.


"In eastern lands, a clan has fallen," explains Poncle in its DLC announcement post. "The Moonspell, once vigilant guardians of a sorcerous valley nestled in the mountains, have been overrun by hordes of yokai and oni. Though treacherous, this hive of spectral activity may provide some clue as to the location of a vampire. If not, at least it'll be entertaining to defeat thousands of wayward spirits in the process."


More specifically, Legacy of the Moonspell introduces eight new characters - including Miang Moonspell, Menya Moonspell, Syuuto Moonspell, and Babi-Onna - plus new monsters, six new music tracks, and a "huge" new stage incorporating the likes of an abandoned castle, yokai-infested village, and snow-covered mountain.

The emote, named "Tidy", allows your character to dance like Snoop Dogg in his 2004 song Drop It Like It's Hot. It's one of a handful of emotes from Fortnite's early days thought to use unlicensed dance moves - other examples of which sparked largely-unsuccessful legal threats from individuals keen to take Epic Games to court. 


Fans were surprised to see the emote return upon the Item Shop's midnight UK time refresh - though its appearance was shortlived, and it was pulled from sale just a couple of hours later.

The game's final 72 cards will release next year in three expansions, set to launch in April, July and September 2023. After this time, CD Projekt will transition from its own monthly balance changes to a system voted on by players. 


Dubbed as "Project Gwenfinity", the idea is that Gwent can be left to just a skeleton crew within CD Projekt to keep an eye on, while the game's community decides on tweaks to exisiting cards to keep up with the current meta.

In an opinion article on the deal published in the Wall St Journal,  Microsoft president Brad Smith committed to making its 10-year COD contract "legally enforceable by regulators in the US, UK and European Union" - territories in which the company was previously felt to be struggling to get its acquisition agreed without making some sort of concessions.


The majority of the opinion piece repeats the same arguments for the deal we've heard from Microsoft many times before - that it would be good for both consumers and game developers, and that Microsoft is still struggling in a sector where it is "stuck behind Sony's dominant PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox will join the growing trend of selling new blockbuster console games for $70 (likely £70) next year. 


This includes the biggest hitters from Microsoft's first-party line-up for 2023, such as Bethesda's Starfield, Arkane's Redfall and the company's own Forza Motorsport reboot.


Of course, as is standard on Xbox, all of these will continue to be made available on day one as part of Xbox Game Pass. There's no suggestion today of any other pricing being changed - such as for that subscription service, or for Xbox hardware.

Simply put, the game's rocky 2020 launch changed the studio's plans. CD Projekt Red had to prioritise fixing the single-player experience, and multiplayer suffered as a result.
"We really needed to look at what were the priorities for Cyberpunk [after it launched]," Philipp Weber told me when I visited the studio last week. Weber was senior quest designer and coordinator on Cyberpunk 2077. Today, he's acting narrative director of the new Witcher game codenamed Polaris.

Now, Netflix is doing what it can to reassure fans that, while this will clearly be a change for the series, it will also bring a "different energy" to the show that the producers are excited about.

Speaking at The Witcher: Blood Origin's UK junket, showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich addressed the series' recasting with a variety of outlets.

The announcement of Cyberpunk 2077's Game of the Year Edition package has raised some eyebrows considering the game's state in the year that it launched, though the "GOTY Edition" branding has now been so over-used it should hardly come as a surprise.

Previously, the FTC's involvement in the deal had signalled a headache for Microsoft, which is facing regulatory approval around the world, and close scrutiny here in the UK. A lawsuit looked imminent - potentially blocking the acquisition, or carving out major concessions.


However, a fresh report by the New York Post into the FTC panel set to decide the deal's fate suggests the trade body is now looking more likely to let it pass.

Forensic container checkpointing is based on Checkpoint/Restore In
Userspace (CRIU) and allows the creation of stateful copies
of a running container without the container knowing that it is being

Then followed an extended 30-minute event mode where players were tasked with reforging the Island anew, using a mix of familiar and fresh locales that look set to appear in Chapter 4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rare has revealed - in what just may be the greatest developer update video I've seen this year - how Sea of Thieves' all-new PvP Hourglass of Fate works. 

"Do YOU want PvP?" cries John McMurtrie, Sea of Thieves' head of video production. "Do you? Are you ready for the thrill of battle?" There's a pause for a knuckle kiss.

"Ugh, skeletons, I don't want them, I want real players," McMurtrie adds. "I want to fight people people!"

That's according to Deadline, which suggests the movie will retain the same basic kung-fu-infused revenge plot as Sloclap's video game, complete with the twist that its protagonist gets steadily older each time they're resurrected by their magical pendant upon death, despite the world around them staying the same.


Deadline says the movie is being described as "John Wick meets M. Night Shyamalan's Old".

<p>In <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/"><i>A Hacker&#8217;s Mind</i></a> (coming in February 2023), I write:</p>

<p>Technology changes the amplitude of the noise. Those near-term ups and downs are getting more severe.

Cross-play was initially announced during Digital Extremes' TennoCon fan event in July 2021, with the developer saying it hoped to launch the feature before the end of that year. It obviously missed that target and then some, but, 12 months later, cross-play is finally here.


"Warframe will always be a game best played and enjoyed with friends and that's why launching Cross Platform Play is such an incredible moment for us," Digital Extremes' chief operating officer Sheldon Carter said in a statement announcing the news. "Together with our partners, we have broken down the walls that have prevented our players from experiencing the thrill of Warframe as one united community."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has shared a lengthy statement in response to recent claims it told organisers of the unofficial Smash World Tour that the popular fan competition, including this month's concluding Smash World Tour Championships, could "no longer operate".


The Smash World Tour, an "international tournament circuit in which competitors for both Ultimate and Melee can qualify for the Smash World Tour Championships", is described by organisers as the "the largest esports tour in history, for any game title". This year's event, which ran between March and November, incorporated 6,400 live events around the world, attracting 325,000 in-person entrants.


With the tour now concluded, this year's Smash World Tour Championships was due to beheld between 9th-11th December, but organisers announced on Tuesday (as reported by Kotaku) they had "received notice the night before Thanksgiving from Nintendo that we could no longer operate". As such, December's Championships and the entirety of next year's Smash World Tour have been cancelled.

It's a change of tack from a studio better known for its Harvest Moon-style life simulations - such as Portia and its follow-up My Time at Sandrock. Let's School looks instead to be more in the vein of Theme Hospital - or more specifically, the recent school-set Two Point Campus.


Let's School is described as a "cosy and colourful" management sim where, as headteacher, you design everything from the school's building layout to its school clubs.

When it launched its first app, Miitomo, back in 2016, Nintendo's then-boss Tatsumi Kimishima said four more smartphone games would debut in the following 12 months.


In reality, Nintendo took several years to hit that milestone, and in the years since has shuttered several of them. Just one new Nintendo mobile game has launched in the last two years: Pikmin Bloom, developed by Pokémon Go maker Niantic.


This week, as Dragalia Lost joined Dr. Mario World and Miitomo on Nintendo's shutdown game scrap pile, the publisher offered a brief update on the continued importance it places on its smartphone efforts.

PlayStation 4 and PS5 versions of the game will arrive in just over a week, on Tuesday 13th December, following the game's debut on Nintendo Switch and Steam earlier this year.


Neon White tasks you with shooting through levels - both in terms of the guns you fire and the speed in which you traverse. A single-player first-person shooter, it arms you with a variety of guns you can then trade-in for parkour moves via a card-based system, with the aim being to finish levels as quickly and cleanly as possible. Here's a look at how it all works:

Debugging software in production is one of the biggest challenges we have to
face in our containerized environments. Being able to understand the impact of
the available security options, especially when it comes to configuring our
deployments, is one of the key aspects to make the default security in
Kubernetes stronger. We have all those logging, tracing and metrics data already
at hand, but how do we assemble the information they provide into something
human readable and actionable?
Seccomp is one of the standard mechanisms to protect a Linux based
Kubernetes application from malicious actions by interfering with its system
calls. This allows us to restrict the application to a defined set of
actionable items, like modifying files or responding to HTTP requests. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three Rare veterans - David Wise, Grant Kirkhope, and Kevin Bayliss - have banded together in the spirit of the holidays to release a video-game-themed Christmas single.


Long-time Rare fans should immediately recognise the trio's contributions to the studio's beloved back catalogue; Wise, for instance, was responsible for many memorable tracks in the Donkey Kong Country series (and provided the sublime score for Nintendo's Tropical Freeze), more recently composing music for Sumo Digital's Snake Pass and Playtonic's Yooka-Laylee.


Kirkhope's impressive credits include Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, Viva Piñata, and more recently, Ubisoft's Mario + Rabbids, and Bayliss has designed characters for the likes of Battletoads, Killer Instinct, Diddy Kong Racing, and Yooka-Laylee. He was famously also behind Donkey Kong's redesign.

The new Indiana Jones game was unveiled early last year, although details were limited. It was described as featuring an "original story" unconnected to the upcoming Indiana Jones 5, with Bethesda's Todd Howard executive producing in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games.


Andersson, who also helped create Eurogamer favourite Yoku's Island Express, announced he'd joined as design director on the "very special" Indiana Jones project in a statement shared on Twitter (thanks VGC), explaining, "I'm so excited about what we are building, and the way we get to do it - featuring one of [the] most iconic characters ever."

Things are a little bit different in 2023, however, and next year's event marks the first time Summer Game Fest will be open to the public.


The show - which promises a mix of premieres, live gameplay demos, and announcements - will take place at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California, in front of a live audience of fans. Tickets go on sale in "early" 2023, but for those unable or uninterested in attending in-person, Summer Game Fest will also stream live on all major streaming platforms.


Summer Game Fest 2023 marks the event's fourth year of operation, and, as is now customary, the live showcase will kickstart a season of smaller events and showcases from participating developers and publishers. Specifics will follow at a later date.

The Bunker - which will be the fourth Amensia game, following on from The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, and last year's Rebirth - promises to be something a little bit different, favouring "unscripted" semi-open-world horror over its predecessors' more linear scares.


"For the first time, players are equipped with high levels of freedom to impact gameplay, choosing their playstyle as they explore at will," Frictional explains in its announcement. "With hardly any scripted events, and constant tension brought about by an ever-present threat, it is up to each player to finesse their approach to survival."

Tweaks to the game since its first round of testing include a fresh option on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S to "reduce input delay" as a setting in the game's Graphics menu, which will "shorten the gap between your inputs and the action happening on-screen".


Alternatively, on PC, you can toggle your Vsync setting off. The trade-off here is that this may increase the likelihood of screen-tearing, Capcom warns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe's highly anticipated The Duviri Paradox expansion might be delayed, but today brings a little something new to tide players over until its arrival next year, courtesy of the survival-based Lua's Prey update, available now on all platforms.


"As The Void exposes ancient scars and long-forgotten secrets," developer Digital Extremes says of its latest update, "something sinister rumbles on Lua as the Grineer descend upon these newly exposed halls seeking possible treasure, corrupted by its long-dormant Orokin Neural Sentry. Under the guidance of The Lotus, the Tenno embark on a mission to investigate this destroyed piece of Lua formerly used to monitor Void Conjunctions."


Lua's Prey serves as a "light prequel" to The Duviri Paradox, adding two new story-based Conjunction Survival missions featuring thematic teasers for next year's expansion. These can be located at two newly added Lua nodes - Yuvarium and Circulus - and challenge players to maintain Life Support in the usual way. The twist, though, is that a Thrax enemy will spawn after every successful Survival round, increasing Life Support depletion by 50% while it remains alive, and requiring players to summon their Necramechs in order to defeat it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has unveiled a new post-launch content roadmap for Sonic Frontiers, promising the likes of new playable characters and story content across three free DLC updates throughout 2023.


There's no estimated time of arrival for any of Sonic Frontier's newly announced updates, but the first will introduce a juke box, photo mode, and a selection of new challenge modes. That'll be followed by a second update celebrating Sonic's birthday - and adding new Koco and a new open zone challenge - suggesting Sega's aiming for a June-ish launch for this one.


Finally, there's the biggie, with Sonic Frontiers' third free update of 2023 teasing new story content and playable characters. The artwork for Update 3 features Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, but it's unclear if these are the new playable characters or just a placeholder design flourish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Rise, the stellar latest entry in Capcom's long-running creature-bopping series, will reportedly be making the jump to PlayStation and Xbox in January next year.


Rise initially launched as a Switch console exclusive last March, with a PC release arriving in January this year. Both versions then received the game's major Sunbreak expansion in July.


And now it seems Monster Hunter Rise is ready to spread its Rathalos-sized wings once more, with prolific leaker Tom Henderson's Insider Gaming reporting Capcom will bring the acclaimed title to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass on 20th January 2023.

The feature offers customisable controls that can be activated in one click, including channel modes (such as follower or sub only chat), chat verification options, and AutoMod levels.


This is a much requested feature, especially in the wake of last summer's hate raids against streamers from minority communities, which remain ongoing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon has revealed the next batch of titles being made available to Prime subscribers as part of December's Prime Gaming line-up, which this time includes classic FPS Quake and the wonderful Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.


id Software's Quake is, of course, a stone-cold classic, serving up a seminal slice of FPS action that - somewhat unbelievably - celebrated its 25th anniversary last year.


Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons mightn't be quite as well-known, but its story of two siblings on an increasingly fantastical quest to find a cure for their father's mysterious affliction is an absolute delight, and a game I find myself returning to every couple of years. The gist is players must overcome its various platform and puzzle challenges by controlling both brothers simulataneously, but it's also gained a proper two-player co-op mode over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warning: this article contains spoilers for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet!
There's a lot of emotional beats in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. And fans have noticed how empty it feels when the cutscenes have no voice acting, but could really benefit from some.
A group of Pokémon fans, who are also voice actors, have come together to dub over some of the game's cutscenes to imagine what the game would be like with voice-over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, this is a nice surprise. Not only is the final content update for Assassin's Creed Valhalla now live on all platforms - a week earlier than planned! - but it includes a surprise tie-in to next year's Bagdhad-based Assassin's Creed Mirage. 


We were expecting this last chapter of Eivor's story to arrive next week, on 6th December. Announcing its early release last night, Ubisoft blamed "an unforeseen glitch in the Animus". 


As expected, this final dollop of Valhalla storyline sees Eivor wrap up her time in England and head off to North America one last time - where the game's opening shows she is buried. There's time for a few final goodbyes with some noteworthy people from Valhalla's long campaign, and then it's off to find out more about what Odin has been up to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has now released its second trailer for the Super Mario Bros. Movie, giving us our best look yet at the upcoming animated film from Minions maker Illumination. 


The trailer showcases a good look at the film's version of Princess Peach (voiced by Anya Tayor-Joy) while Chris Pratt's Mario only gets a couple of lines of dialogue. Overall, it's a fun glimpse at some familiar Mario locales and characters, translated for the big screen. 


If you're a Nintendo nerd like me, you've probably rewatched the trailer more than once to spot everything going on in the background. And there's some cool Easter eggs - particularly if you like the extended Donkey Kong family. Let's give it one more watch and dive in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More glitches have been discovered in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet (who would have thunk it) which allow players to duplicate items, and even their legendary Pokémon.
Plenty of bugs and exploits have already been found, whether it's creating body horror or duplicating shiny Pokémon, but this is on a different level. In the game, you're supposed to only have one of the legendaries, whether that's Koraidon or Miraidon, but now you can fill up your boxes with them.
These new-found glitches have been widely discussed in the Pokémon community, and they're not that difficult to pull off. One has been tested by yours truly, and I can confirm it works. The other requires you to have beaten the end-game, which I've not reached yet so I can't confirm at the moment whether it works or not. Beware some spoilers ahead!

Colt Canyon is described as an "atmospheric and punchy" rogue-like shooter set in a pixel-art Wild West, where players can root and toot their way toward saving their kidnapped partner from ruthless bandits. "Take your gun and TNT," explains developer Retrific, "and shoot your way through a hostile canyon full of hidden treasures, weapons, obstacles and all kinds of bloodthirsty scum."


Eurogamer hasn't scanned a critical eye over Colt Canyon, but with a Very Positive rating over on Steam, the masses appear to think this one is pretty good!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a solid first showing for the long-awaited Super Mario Bros. Movie in October, Nintendo has returned with a second action-packed trailer, this time giving us a first proper look at Peach, Donkey Kong, and a delightful karting cameo for Rainbow Road.


In fact, it's a bit of a treat for Mario fans all-round, casting its net wide to introduce a host of familiar faces, places, and power-ups, all given a vibrant movie makeover. It's the first time we get to hear Anya Taylor-Joy's no-nonsense Princess Peach, for instance, as well as Charlie Day as Luigi, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong, even though the latter's debut was mainly just a grunt.


Elsewhere, the trailer delivers a breakneck tour of the movie's beautifully reimagined Mushroom Kingdom, giving us a stroll across a bridge amid of flurry of Cheep Cheeps, a glimpse inside Peach's castle, and, of course, the crowd-pleasing addition of karts hurtling across Rainbow Road.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR - developer Supermassive Games' rail-shooter spin on its acclaimed narrative horror series - has been confirmed as a launch day title for Sony's PlayStation VR 2, meaning it'll arrive on 22nd February next year.


Switchback isn't Supermassive's first foray into spooky VR, of course; it previously adapted its cinematic horror game Until Dawn into both a VR prequel and a gaudy, rollercoaster-like rail shooter called Rush of Blood. And Dark Pictures: Switchback VR is very much a spiritual successor to the latter, sending players on a "nightmarish and horrifying" branching VR thrill ride through scenes that should be familiar to Dark Pictures fans.


"Survive the Ghost Ship and its distorted apparitions," Supermassive teases, "confront hideous demonic incarnations of persecuted 'witches'. Fight for your life against other-worldly vampires and escape the horrifying World's Fair Hotel's sadistic serial killer."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has unveiled Lost Between Worlds, a new expansion for Far Cry 6 that'll whisk players away to a fractured alien version of Yara when it launches on 6th December.


Lost Between Worlds' surreal extraterrestrial action begins when Far Cry 6 protagonist Dani Rojas inadvertently stumbles across a crashed alien ship inhabited by an alein AI known as FAI. Unfortunately for Dani, FAI immediately seals the surrounding area and demands they embark on a quest to retrieve five crystals needed to repair their ship - each one hidden away in a mysterious rift containing a fractured simulation of Yara.


There are familiar locations twisted into a surreal architectural kaleidoscope, others plunged deep underwater, and still others ravaged by endless lightning storms. Every rift features multiple routes via orange and purple portals, and players will need to use their combat, parkour, and puzzle skills to pick their way through and retrieve the crystal housed in each one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A three-year study into the impact of video game loot boxes on young people has concluded that such mechanics cause "financial and emotional harm" to teenagers and children. 


The report, published by Newcastle and Loughborough Universities, tracked the gaming habits of 42 families with children aged between five and 17, and interviewed another 30 parents, carers and video game designers.


In short, the study found children struggled to track spending in video games where "highly alluring" digital items were advertised to them using techniques borrowed from regulated gambling.

Wilkie first stated his intention to introduce the Classication Amendment (Loot Boxes) Bill last year (via Kotaku Australia). Back then, he wanted any games with loot boxes to be given a R18+ rating, and a new "advisory" classification to highlight their presence.
The bill was filed yesterday by Wilkie, and the details of it can be viewed on the Australian government's website.

However, one image that probably isn't immediately conjured up in your head when thinking about Rockstar's long-standing franchise is a whopping great big dinosaur rampaging the streets. And yet, this is actually the sort of game Grand Theft Auto started life off as. 


Speaking to the BBC alongside the series' 25th anniversary, developer Colin Macdonald revealed "GTA went through a lot of different iterations and [had] quite a troubled development", stating the first game "wasn't really regarded well for most of the time it was in production."

Specifically, Bohemia has called for players and content creators to "use their game footage responsibly", "refrain from using clickbait video titles" and "always state clearly that the video originated from a video game" rather than footage from a real-life conflict.


Arma 3 gameplay videos have a history of being mistaken for real-world footage - even by professional news organisations - and this problem has only increased since the current conflict in Ukraine has begun, Bohemia said.

It's the first detailed description we've had of the remake, and suggests a more from-the-ground-up reworking of the original role-player than previously thought. 


Thanks to the success of The Witcher 3, the series is now thought of as a fully open-world franchise. But that was not the case back in the original Witcher game, which featured a number of separate large maps and various smaller areas.

Inspired by Paul Verhoeven's cult-classic 1997 movie, Starship Troopers: Extermination drops up to three squads of four players onto the front lines amid an Arachnid assault, challenging them to work together to complete objectives, acquire resources, build and defend their base of operations, and finally escape to the extraction zone.


There are three classes to choose from - Assault, Support, and Defense, each with their own weapons, equipment, and perks - alongside a base building system that sees players using resources acquired from planetside refineries to construct walls, towers, ammo stations, and various other amenities in an effort to gain the upper hand in battle.

Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures' Illumination animation division, and sees Chris Pratt, in the role of Mario, heading an all-star cast including Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.


We got a promising first glimpse of the Mario movie back in October, with its debut trailer managing to look the part and land a few successful visual gags - with Jack Black and Keegan-Michael Key, who plays Toad, clearly having a blast in their roles.

This latest release date marks Ubisoft's fourth attempt at getting its Settlers reboot out the door; when the publisher first revealed it was revisiting the series' much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula back in 2018, the reboot was expected to arrive in autumn the following year. That wasn't to be, though, and the game was first pushed into 2020 before being postponed indefinitely as summer 2020 rolled around.


It seemed like the end was finally in sight for patient The Settlers fans at the start of this year, however, when Ubisoft announced a new 17th March release date for its reboot - but, following less-than-stellar closed beta feedback, the publisher slammed on the breaks once more, only saying the game would instead launch at "a later date".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly readying to make a number of formal concessions to EU regulators investigating its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, including the guarantee Call of Duty will be availalble on PlayStation for the next ten years.


Call of Duty has remained a focal point during government scrutiny of Microsoft's Activision Blizzard deal, with regulators - including those in the UK and Europe - raising fears Microsoft may leverage the juggernaut franchise to gain an unfair advantage over its competition.


Reports in September revealed Microsoft had initially pledged to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for "at least several more years" beyond Activision's existing deal - an arrangement PlayStation boss Jim Ryan would go on to call "inadequate on many levels" - but as regulatory scrutiny deepened, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said the company would continue releasing Call of Duty on Sony's consoles for "as long as there's a PlayStation out there to ship to".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go has revealed details of its ninth season, Mythical Wishes, which will carry the game through the next three months: from 1st December to 1st March. 


Mythical Wishes is a reference to Hoenn's Mythical creature Jirachi, which has only appeared in Pokémon Go once previously. It looks set for a reappearance (and possible Shiny debut?) at 2023's Pokémon Go Tour event, which is set to be detailed fully tomorrow. More tangibly, today's new trailer also teases the release of Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre at the end - some of the most powerful creatures in the series, and a big deal for fans.


Hoenn creatures dominate much of the next season, with the introduction of the region's three Starter creatures in their Mega evolved forms: Mega Sceptile, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Swampert. The trio will debut via a Raid Day event this Saturday, 3rd December which will offer a number of extra free raid passes.

Single-player DLC for the game looks unlikely, and the bundled multiplayer offering Red Dead Online was pronounced "dead" by its community of players after developer Rockstar confirmed it would no longer push major updates to the game to shift development to Grand Theft Auto 6 instead.
That hasn't put people off enjoying Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, however (with some help from the Thanksgiving holidays across the pond and Steam's autumn sale).

"Add speakers, a microphone and a Full HD camera, and you have the smartest dog tech product to ever hit the market," Joipaw proclaims on the console's reservation page.

The now-fixed exploit let you repeatedly sell weapons at the game's Buy Stations in exchange for XP. In a quick fix for the issue, XP from Buy Stations was nerfed to counter the number of people quickly levelling up their weapons. 


But, as fans quickly found, this still left the game's white dumpster Dead Drops as an option. This lasted another half day or so, until it too was countered by another behind the scenes change.

The horror franchise's first two titles - Man of Medan and Little Hope - were updated on 28th September with a spruce-up designed to introduce difficulty settings, QTE warnings and more accessibility options. Man of Medan even gained a "previously unseen" story chapter. 


But these updates also had the unintended consequence of introducing a raft of bugs to the games, with a number of players complaining of being unable to save or make progress past certain points.

However, it turns out that if you remove all of his hair (bar his eyebrows, thank goodness), he looks really quite different... and I am not sure that is a good thing.


As shared by prolific modder Speclizer, who recently unlocked God of War Ragnarök's unfinished photo mode, there is now a The Last of Us Part 2 mod that makes Joel's head and face almost as smooth as a baby's bottom.

Why would you want to kiss Meowscarada? Well, when its design leaked shortly before launch, people quickly made hordes of fan art, some of which was not particularly wholesome or Safe For Work.

This news is not surprising. Earlier reports revealed that Warner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav had spoken to the wider company about plans to "build a bible for a cohesive DC universe" that would include media such as "live-action films, TV, animation, gaming and more".

Starting with Kubernetes 1.25, our container image registry has changed from k8s.gcr.io to registry.k8s.io. This new registry spreads the load across multiple Cloud Providers & Regions, functioning as a sort of content delivery network (CDN) for Kubernetes container images. This change reduces the project’s reliance on a single entity and provides a faster download experience for a large number of users.
TL;DR: What you need to know about this change
Container images for Kubernetes releases from 1.25 onward are no longer published to k8s.gcr.io, only to registry.k8s.io.
In the upcoming December patch releases, the new registry domain default will be backported to all branches still in support (1.22, 1.23, 1.24).

The update primarily hopes to address bugs and issues with the game, as well as provide some additional - if unspecified - quality-of-life improvements for players.

Whilst the game's English-language social media channels have yet to publicise the patch, the blue blur's Japanese counterpart has, revealing that the update is now ready for PS4 and PS5 now and will be available for other platforms "in the near future".

No, I'm not talking about the (also horrifying) Rock Bottom episode where SpongeBob gets stuck in Glove World; it turns out that the way animated characters move have inspired the character director of The Callisto Protocol, too.

“Some creatures came from the art perspective, though, like, 'Hey, let's just do something that is very crazy looking'. And then we put that in the game and find a way of making it work," character director Glauco Longhi told  GLHF, via The Sun.

Whilst the number includes players who are idle - that is, signed in but not actively playing anything - Steam's own analytics show that a new peak of 31,349,780 concurrent players was set over the weekend. 

As is often the case, third-party tracker SteamDB boasts a slightly different number - a higher figure of 31,379,760 concurrent players - 9.3 of whom were actively online and gaming at the time the record was set.

As spotted by the eagle-eyed folks at Resetera, the fighting game - which, as yet, does not have a firm release date beyond a very vague "2023" window - has secured a 15 age rating due to its "expression of physical damage shown in illustrations in addition to basic fighting expression".

Whilst this doesn't necessarily mean that a release is just around the corner, it does intimate that it's probably set to drop in the next six months or so… and with The Game Awards just a few days away now, many fans are speculating that we may get that all-important release date then.

It predates not only the 2nd December release date but also the early access period,too,  which is supposed to go live on 29th November.

Interestingly, it doesn't look like the YouTube accounts in question took the footage themselves, as two of the videos were recorded from a Twitch livestream broadcast by someone called gerrykurlsucks, and another from a content creator called Chocolove95.

Dead Island 2 was, somewhat unbelievably, initially unveiled all the way back in 2014, promising more of the kind of co-operative zombie shooting action that had made developer Techland's enjoyable 2011 original a bit of a hit.


Since then, though, development has been turbulent, with the sequel missing its initially announcement 2015 release date and losing its original developer - Spec Ops: The Line studio Yager - that same year. Eight months later, British developer Sumo Digital was revealed to have taken over the project, but another studio switch was still to come when Homefront: The Revolution maker Dambuster Studios took the reins in 2019.

The team behind Tamriel Rebuilt has been releasing content for Morrowind since 2002, though its conception happened in 2001 before Morrowind was released.

21 years later, the project is still going strong. In its first update in nearly two years, the project has added two more expansions with new areas of Tamriel to explore (thanks PC Gamer).

Robertson became somewhat of an internet darling following her portrayal of the towering and beguiling Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village. She won legions of fans for her part in Capcom's long running series, and even won a few awards for it too.


Needless to say, dear reader, I am one of those fans, and since hearing she was a part of God of War Ragnarök, I have been eager to find her character in the game.

Tales from the Far Territory, as the new expansion is known, releases in six parts over the course of 12 months, each arriving approximately every 8-10 weeks. All six parts will focus on The Long Dark's much-loved Survival mode, but there are narrative elements in there and Hinterland is referring to the complete series as a "campaign".


Exactly what will be coming when is currently unclear, but Hinterland has now detailed all the major features it'll be introducing to Survival mode throughout the expansion. There are three new areas, for instance - the Forsaken Airfield, Industrial Mine, and Mountain Pass - all accessible via the Far Range Branchline and Transfer Pass hub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's barely been a week since American Truck Simulator thundered across the Texan border, but already SCS Software is setting course for a new destination, with the developer having now confirmed Oklahoma as the trucking sim's next DLC expansion.


Oklahoma will be American Truck Simulator's 12th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas - and its announcement isn't all that unexpected given SCS' continued left-to-right march across the US, and Oklahoma slotting so neatly above the recently released Texas.


"While Oklahoma tends to have an unfortunate reputation of being a rather arid place," SCS writes in its announcement post, "sometimes it's much better to avoid judging a book by its cover. The state is home to wonderful national parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends. And if you are looking for something more practical instead, the local road network and a strong economy will keep every trucker properly busy."

Fire starter Fuecoco has been branded as "broken" by proponents of Pokémon's "Nuzlocke" style of gameplay - the fan-invented method of playing Pokémon which essentially amounts to permadeath. 


Any Pokémon which faints in a Nuzlocke run is considered dead and must be released back into the wild. Additionally, you may only catch the first creature in any area and no other, severely limiting the number of Pokémon at your disposal.

Activision falls under the latter category with what is possibly the most creative (or bizarre) tie-in I have ever seen. 


In Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2/Warzone 2.0, players can now vote on which team they think will win future matches. Those who guess correctly get 10,000 XP, that national team's flag as a Calling Card, oh and a remix of their national anthem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're discussing the PlayStation 6 - specifically, Sony's concerns about Call of Duty not being available on the upcoming platform, which we now know will debut sometime from 2027 onwards. 

It's been another week dominated by news of Microsoft's $68bn Activision Blizzard takeover attempt, which is currently being scrutinised by the UK's anti-competition regulator. Partially-redacted documentation from this process has now been made public, revealing some eyebrow-raising arguments from Sony - which is trying to block the deal. 
Both Sony and Microsoft have gone on the defensive to make themselves look the smaller fish - with Microsoft  admitting Sony's exclusives are better and Sony saying any loss of Call of Duty would leave itself "extremely vulnerable", particularly if the series was made available through the popular Xbox Game Pass. So, should Sony be worried - or is this all just performative theatrics? Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

The M13B Assault Rifle is contentiously locked behind a challenge in Warzone's DMZ mode and is a massive pain in the bottom to complete. 


However, players have also found a neat trick that means that only one person in your group of friends has to complete the challenge. That player can then "drop" the weapon for other members of the squad to pick up, extract, and unlock.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fresh details of the legal battle between Disco Elyisum creatives and their former bosses have emerged, as part of a hearing held in an Estonian court. 


To recap on the story so far: a trio of high profile staff behind the first Disco Elysium game were fired from developer ZA/UM following the company's takeover by Estonian businessmen Ilmar Kompus, who is now ZA/UM's boss and controlling shareholder, and Tõnis Haavel who was previously convicted of investment fraud. 


On the one side, some of the staff - including Disco Elysium game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov - have previously alleged that Kompus and Haavel's takeover was fraudulent, and that they were booted out when trying to discover more. On the other, Kompus and Haavel have claimed the firings were due to some staff creating a "toxic environment" - and they were allegedly planning to depart the studio anyway to try and build a Disco Elysium sequel elsewhere.

But while Soap is certainly a key part of the series, there are still some aspects of his persona that are left untold. Well, this list of unknown attributes just got a little shorter, thanks to his Modern Warfare 2 bio.


Here, it is revealed that Soap got his nickname not because he is fastidious in the shower, but because he is good at "cleaning house". In fact, this is something he does with "remarkable speed and accuracy in room clearance techniques and urban warfare tactics".

Making a statement on Twitter, Meservey said any notion the deal would be anticompetitive is "absurd" and that the "merger will benefit gamers and the US gaming industry - especially as we face stiffer competition from abroad".


This could be referring to moves made by Sweden's Embracer Group and China's Tencent to acquire more studios and IPs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed Pokémon Violet and Scarlet sold over 10m copies in their first three days of release, making it the company's biggest ever launch in that time period.


Pokémon Violet and Scarlet have faced significant criticism since release - Digital Foundry called the games "comprehensive technical failures" - but that hasn't stopped them from smashing previous series entries' already considerable launch day records.


We already knew Violet and Scarlet were off to a flying start when charts firm GfK confirmed the pair were not only the UK's biggest boxed video game launch of the year, but the UK's second biggest boxed Pokémon launch of all time - only being beaten out by 3DS' Sun and Moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Striking Distance Studios has responded to the news its sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol's season pass will feature exclusive death animations, insisting these haven't been cut from the main game to sell for an additional fee.


As detailed on Steam, The Callisto Protocol's season pass consists of four components: the Outer Way Skin Collection, story DLC, a Riot Bundle featuring a new wave-based mode set in an "undiscovered area" of Black Iron Prison, and a permadeath mode included in the Contagion Bundle. Eyebrows were raised, however, with the news the latter two bundles would also add a total of 25 new death animations - 13 for protagonist Jacob and 12 for enemies.


Much of The Callisto Protocol’s pre-release publicity has focused on its myriad gruesome death animations as a key selling point - Striking Distance's CEO Glen Schofield discussed its "gore engine" with Eurogamer earlier this year - so there was a degree of incredulity when Striking Distance revealed more than two dozen of these would only be available to purchasers of the season pass, being sold as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition for an additional £20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look out Netflix, Amazon, HBO, and Paramount; the BBC wants in on that juicy video game adaptation action and is bringing Ubisoft's beloved Splinter Cell series to life in a new Radio 4 drama, starting next Friday, 2nd December.


Splinter Cell's audio adaptation - officially titled Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Firewall - follows series protagonist and Fourth Echelon agent Sam Fisher on a mission to recruit and train the next generation of operatives for the National Security Agency's covert action division. "When a lethal assassin from Fisher's past returns from the dead on a mission of murder," the BBC teases, "he is thrust into a race against time as a sinister threat to global security is revealed."


Firewall stars Andonis Anthony (The Archers) as Sam Fisher, and Daisy Head as his daughter Sarah. Other cast members include Sacha Dhawan (Doctor Who, The Great), Will Poulter (Midsommer, Black Mirror), and Nikesh Patel (Starstruck, The Devil's Hour).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt's long-promised next-gen update for The Witcher 3 is almost upon us, and ahead of its PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC arrival on 14th December, the studio has shared a first look at the various enhancements it'll bring.


As far as technical improvements go, CD Projekt positively whistled through them during its first-look livestream, but PC players can expect to see support for the likes of raytracing, DLSS, and FSR, alongside a selection of new Ultra Plus graphics options, boosting background characters, level of detail, and more.


Indeed, there are visual touch-ups across the board, including a rework for grass and foliage, enhanced and more varied weather conditions, plus higher resolution textures and meshes throughout environments. Novigrad's cobblestones are no longer normal maps, for instance, and instead now fully 3D. Keen-eyed players will also see the likes of smoke drifting from chimneys in distant villages.

This crackdown has achieved "remarkable results", the China Game Industry Group Committee data provider CNG said, with more than 75 percent of all under-18s now claimed to be following the rules.

PlayStation Studios head Herman Hulst shared the news on Twitter, thanking fans and congratulating God of War Ragnarök developer Sony Santa Monica for its "amazing achievement".


We already knew God of War Ragnarök was doing the numbers, of course - it set the day-one sales record for the franchise here in the UK - but Hulst's announcement confirmed it had also set a first-week sales record for the series around the world. By way of comparison, Ragnarök's immediate predecessor shifted 3.1m copies in its first three days back in 2018, beating out the previous record held by God of War 3 in 2010.

The partially-redacted document was released publicly today as part of the UK's ongoing in-depth Competition and Markets Authority review into Microsoft's proposed $68bn Activision Blizzard buyout - a deal Sony has strongly objected to. 


In an intriguing passage discussing the length of time Call of Duty may remain on PlayStation, Sony claims that (at the time of writing) it expected to lose access to the franchise in 2027. Sony then goes on to state that by the time it "launched the next generation of its PlayStation console... it would have lost access to Call of Duty and other Activision titles".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly nine months on from launch, Gran Turismo 7 has introduced one of its most heavily requested features, as the game's 1.26 update finally allows players to sell cars in their garage. 


The inability to sell vehicles was a key part of the criticisms aimed towards the PlayStation exclusive at launch, with a miserly economy and expensive microtransactions souring the experience for many. It's a bit baffling that it's taken so long, and there's still a little uncertainty precisely how it'll work and how good the payouts will be, but it does at least come as part of a generous update. 


The big addition that comes with the 1.26 patch is a track that's entirely new to Gran Turismo, and is something a bit special. Road Atlanta's a 2.5 mile circuit set in the north of the state of Georgia, and is one of the finest road courses in the USA. It plays host to the Petit Le Mans each year, a challenging race that makes the most of its undulations and whip-quick esses for one of the most punishing endurance races where 10 hours feels more like 100 (at least that's what it felt like the few times I've run its iRacing virtual equivalent).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals are already coming in thick and fast, with new discounts on Switch bundles, games and accessories launching each day. Keeping up to date with all the best Nintendo Switch deals can be overwhelming, especially if you're not sure where to look first. So to help you find the best savings on Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED and Nintendo Switch Lite deals this Black Friday, we're bringing you them all here in one handy place. If you're after some cheap Nintendo Switch games or accessories, we're covering them here, too. 
Whether you're buying for yourself, or doing some early Christmas shopping, you'll be pleased to know that you can make some excellent savings on Nintendo Switch products before the official Black Friday sale begins. In fact, some deals are often better in the lead up to the huge shopping event than on Black Friday itself, which is why we've been sharing so many of them over on our Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals hub. Make sure to go check that out too!
Nintendo fans will also know that the company rarely discounts its hardware and first party titles, which makes Black Friday one of the best times to tick off some items from your wishlist. So if you're buying yourself or a loved one their first Switch console, or you've been putting off that upgrade to a shiny new Switch OLED, now is the perfect time to do so. If you're buying the Switch console on its own, you may also want to grab a Mario, Zelda or Kirby game while they're on sale as well.

Hotz shot to internet fame in 2008 for being the first to jailbreak the iPhone. Around a year later, he followed that feat by hacking the PlayStation 3 - and memorably rapped about Sony's subsequent attempts to sue him. The two sides ultimately settled matters outside of court.


Now, Hotz has agreed to join Musk at Twitter on a temporary work contract (something which seems wise).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a Santa descending from the heavens on a reindeer made of space, Hello Games has delved into its sack of procedural treats to give good No Man's Sky fans one final gift for 2022: another chance to play all four of this year's Expeditions and snag any goodies they might have missed the first time around.


Expeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are something like No Man's Sky's stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. And the rewards for completing each one are usually pretty neat, ranging from robot dog companions to your very own space whale.


And now Hello Games has confirmed it'll be re-running all four of 2022's Expedition starting this Thursday, 24th November. As was the case in last year's redux event, Expeditions will run in truncated form, each lasting for just two weeks before the next one rolls in - meaning players eager to acquire any rewards they might have missed (including those on Switch, who haven't had chance to play any of these yet) will have to work quick.

Arika's The Grand Master series first appeared in Japanese arcades back in 1988, where it quickly gained a reputation for its difficulty, thanks to the rapid drop speed increase during play. It also features a grading system, ranking performance all the way up to Grand Master.


Several sequels followed, and the series eventually made the jump to home consoles in Japan with 2005's Tetris: The Grand Master Ace for Xbox 360 - which was to be its final release.

First up in the Leader Pass' inaugural DLC, known as the Great Negotiations Pack, is Abraham Lincoln, representing the United States. Lincoln abides by the Preserver of the Union agenda - meaning he only likes civilisations with the same form of government - and makes use of his Emancipation Proclamation ability, which has a number of different effects depending on the expansions players have installed.


Those with just the base game get +2 Amenities for Industrial Zones and their buildings, but receive -1 Amenities for Plantations. These numbers increase to +3 Amenities per turn and -2 Loyalty respectively when using the Rise and Fall & Gathering Storm DLCs.

You don't need to have progressed that far into the game to make these work, though you'll probably want a relatively high-level Pokémon to do some bidding for you.
I briefly tested the two methods currently making the rounds in the community, and whilst one worked for me, the other didn't. So be wary, your mileage may vary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today decided to launch an in-depth investigation into Apple and Google, looking at the restrictions set by each company that affect access to smartphone cloud gaming.


The move follows an earlier proposal to investigate the two companies' market power, and a year-long study of the iPhone and Android ecosystems. That report, published in June, determined Apple and Google held "an effective duopoly" over smartphone markets, allowing them to "exercise a stranglehold" over mobile operating systems, app stores and web browsers.


Further work by the CMA included consultations with unnamed "cloud gaming service providers", as well as web developers and browser makers, who said Apple and Google's approach was "harming their businesses, holding back innovation, and adding unnecessary costs". These concerns will be investigated further as part of a far-reaching "Phase 2" CMA investigation.

Also, if you're anything like me, you'll have rewatched yesterday's Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC Wave 3 trailer multiple times, trying to spot all the tweaks and additions to some of the many returning tracks. (And yes, that does sound like a newly-recorded version of Maple Treeway's score.)


Alongside yesterday's trailer I saw a generally warmer reception to the visuals in these latest additions than in some of the other DLC drops so far - which have been criticised by fans as not standing up to graphical quality seen in the base game. These DLC tracks are, by and large, taken from Mario Kart Tour - the series' smartphone spin-off - with an extra layer of polish attached.

The intended sequence of the game would see you play through The First Day of School quest, which would then unlock all the other storylines in the game.
However, players have found a way to skip the latter section of the quest, allowing you to cut out the tedium of meeting your new classmates and teachers and get straight into exploring the open-world of Paldea.

Amidst headlines on migrant worker conditions, LGBTQ+ rights and criticism of the tournament from both players and fans, it's been interesting to see how brands - and video games - are noting Qatar 2022.


Fortnite has a history with football - and its governing bodies. Some of its most popular skins are based on football kit designs, and the game's meme-like dances were a fixture of England's 2018 World Cup squad. Last year, Epic Games officially licensed the likenesses of England's Harry Kane and Germany's Marco Reus for the delayed 2020 Euros, and featured an in-game "UEFA Euro 2020 Cup" tournament with cash prizes. 


Prior to that, Fortnite has added skins wearing the officially-licensed football shirts of 23 top teams worldwide, including many from the Premiership. Fortnite also has an officially licensed Neymar Jr. skin, and an emote where you can punch the air that was launched in a collaboration with Pelé.

Activision shared the news of this milestone on its social media feeds, thanking those who have taken part in its frenzied battlegrounds so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to the days of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and you may recall an infamous bug that allowed players to soar through the skies in a fashion that should not be not humanly possible. This became known as the 'Superman' exploit, due to the way the players looked when this glitch was in motion - positioned horizontally in a skydiving position.


And now, when playing Call of Duty's most recent offerings of Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, you may well see this move in play once more. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's just your teammate channelling their inner Clark Kent. 


Today's version of the Superman exploit was recently shared by prolific Warzone 2 player Wuqi. In a compilation, the gamer can be seen bouncing off certain points on the maps while diving in the air, giving them a soaring boost. This, as you can see below, allows them to cover ground a lot more quickly than the more traditional methods of traversal.

It was around this time that the RPG's PS4 version disappeared from the PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue.

Crossplay and cross-progression have, of course, been available in Rainbow Six Siege for some time now, but only between PC, Stadia, and Luna. As of next month, though, that'll open out to incorporate PlayStation and Xbox, so console owners can take advantage of the features too.


From 6th December, console players can access their progress, currencies, and other items across all platforms simply by logging into their accounts. They can also team up with friends on other consoles via Ubisoft Connect, although it's possible to opt out of crossplay if preferred.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the launch of MultiVersus' second season last week, the free-to-play fighter's roster has now expanded once more, this time ushering in Looney Tunes' extraterrestrial extraordinaire Marvin the Martian.


Marvin's imminent arrival was teased last week as Season 2 got underway, but he officially joins the line-up today, bringing Multiversus' total number of playable fighters up to 23 - with Marvin joining recent additions such as Black Adam and Gremlins' Gizmo and Stripe.


Marvin can be unlocked with 3000 Gold, 1 Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium, and features three signature moves. There's his B-23 Bubble Blaster, giving players the power to launch bubble projectiles, and that's joined by his K-62 Projectile Modulator - basically a big red button that will reverse the direction of allied projectiles. Finally, Marvin can plant his flag into the ground, simultaneously claiming it for Mars and sending enemies skyward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As intense government scrutiny of Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard continues, with many regulatory bodies placing particular importance on the future of the Call of Duty franchise, Microsoft has told the New York Times it offered Sony a 10-year deal to keep the series on PlayStation earlier this month.


In total, 16 regulatory bodies around the world have launched investigations into Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard to assess its likely impact on competition. So far, only Brazil and Saudi Arabia have approved the deal, with a number of territories, including the European Commission and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, having announced more in-depth reviews of the matter.


In both those cases, Call of Duty's future has been highlighted as a particular concern, with regulators raising fears the juggernaut franchise may be leveraged by Microsoft to gain an unfair advantage over its competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has delayed its promised fix for excessive autonomous meanness in The Sims 4, meaning players are now going to have to put up with their Sims spontaneously picking fights and ruining each others lives until early December.


All this started back in October when, following a patch update, The Sims 4 players began reporting their Sims were autonomously insulting friends, relatives, and passersby at an alarming frequency, causing havoc to their carefully curated stories.


Eventually, with insults continuing to fly and households lying in ruin, EA moved to acknowledge the issue, promising a fix would arrive as soon as its investigation was complete.

Rumours of the game's existence began in summer, when it was accidentally let slip by Windows Central. Speculation on a new Crash Bandicoot game increased when Toys for Bob teased their 18th game, and fans are expecting to see a new entry in the series announced at The Game Awards next month.

The prototype was leaked yesterday by YouTuber Liam Robertson, for reasons he described as "historical interest". A short snippet of gameplay is shown along with concept arts. Robertson reiterated throughout the video that the footage shown comes from a very early version of the project, and that it is "not representative of what the game could look like if it releases".

Sharing her story on Twitter, composer Jessica Mao stated she "worked on the editing/arrangement/implementation of the Freya chase scene" as well as the "Thor boss fight music".


However, despite her input, Mao said her name was not included in the game's end credits as her contribution to Ragnarök didn't hit the "minimum criteria"  required (although Mao is unsure what "this criteria could be").

The game's current state is far from perfect, leading to plenty of glitches, jankiness and sometimes full on Bethesda-level comedy horror.
Personally, I picked up the game precisely for that experience (I am having fun playing the game also!) but sadly I've not encountered anything funkier than a T-pose during my time with Violet so far. Luckily for me, there are countless other people who've been sharing their witness accounts on Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its release just shy of two weeks ago, there has been a lot of chatter about God of War Ragnarök. This has ranged from whether or not there should be a PETA friendly mode included in the game, to Kratos' atonement for his past behaviour.


One thing that has really struck a chord is the amount of help Ragnarök's companions give when players are trying to solve puzzles. Many fans feel that, really, it would be better if said companions just held on to their advice for that little bit longer than they ultimately choose to. 


For example, much like many others, I like to venture off the game's main path every so often to see if there are any treasures tucked away I could miss if I left the area too soon. (This is all just standard exploration, not a sign that I don't have a clue what I am doing. Honestly, it is.) Early on in the game I took one step away from Atreus and was swiftly told I was going the wrong way. "I think this wheel over here needs to turn," he called after my retreating footsteps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon has teased a return for some of the series' 3D-era characters in the future, following previous hints at the under-wraps Mortal Kombat 12 being in development. 


Boon, who loves to tease fans via Twitter, wrote over the weekend that his next game would either be "I3 or MK12" - Injustice 3 or Mortal Kombat 12.


Responding to a fan who asked why so few characters from the franchise's less-popular 3D-era are seen in recent games, Boon stated: "That is something we will soon fix."

<blockquote><p>The researchers said their break came when they understood that while Zeppelin used three different types of encryption keys to encrypt files, they could undo the whole scheme by factoring or computing just one of them: An ephemeral RSA-512 public key that is randomly generated on each machine it infects.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can recover the RSA-512 Public Key from the registry, we can crack it and get the 256-bit AES Key that encrypts the files!&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;The challenge was that they delete the [public key] once the files are fully encrypted. Memory analysis gave us about a 5-minute window after files were encrypted to retrieve this public key.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The site allows users to upload custom images for use in their Steam library. Most of these are alternate cover images to customise a game's appearance in the library, but it's also used when a cover image doesn't exist - typically when playing games through an emulator.


This is why Switch game images have appeared on the site, which has since received a DMCA takedown notice, Games Radar reported.

This has also won Scarlet and Violet the title of being the UK's second biggest boxed Pokémon launch of all time. The biggest is still that of the 3DS's Sun and Moon (although, due to sale prices, charts firm GfK states Scarlet and Violet has generated more money than Sun and Moon did during its launch week). 


Per GamesIndustry.biz, the first week of sales for Scarlet and Violet (at least physically, as Nintendo does not share digital sales) are 25 percent bigger than those of Sword and Shield, 70 percent bigger than the Diamond and Pearl remakes and 56 percent bigger than this year's other big Pokémon offering, Arceus.

The NX name was used by Nintendo to refer to the Switch both internally and publicly, as the company began to drum up excitement for the Switch's unveiling. (And because in the Wii U era, there wasn't much else to get excited about.)

Imaginatively entitled "official launch trailer UK", it packs a lot of action into just under two minutes of footage, most of which we've seen before, but some that will be new to those who have been tracking the game's development. You can watch every slimy, gory second of it below:

The trailer also features the exclusive song Lost Again by Kings Elliot and confirms that the penultimate episode of the game's six-part audio series, The Callisto Protocol: Helix Station, is also now available, along with the final part of the Engineering Horror docuseries, too.

As highlighted by u/AHappyPandaBear - and upvoted hundreds of times - players point out that although Apex Legends and PUBG Battlegrounds permit players to return mid-game following crashes or internet issues, Warzone does not, making it "a massive L" for the community.

The issue is particularly troublesome for DMZ players, who say they are losing "so much" loot and contraband without the chance to rejoin the session.

Whilst developer Ubisoft acknowledged that the "news will come as a disappointment" to some players, because of Valhalla's "very different structure from its predecessors", the open-world Viking game will be the first Assassin's Creed game not to feature an option to boot up a New Game+ run.

"Assassin's Creed Valhalla has been built as a unique Assassin’s Creed experience, one that is very different from its predecessors in its structure, offering new ways of engaging with the world and its characters," Ubisoft explained in a blog post (thanks, GamesRadar+).

Cookstar has been embroiled in trouble ever since its release on Switch in March 2020, which saw it quickly disappear from Nintendo's eShop and physical stores - a move later revealed to be due to a licensing dispute between Office Create and publisher Planet Entertainment.


Office Create claimed Planet Entertainment had refused to correct what it saw as a "wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality and content of the game" during development, despite being contractually obligated to do so, and had instead proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without Office Create's approval.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortality, the acclaimed investigative Hollywood mystery from Her Story developer Sam Barlow, is now available on iOS and Android via Netflix.


Immortality tells the story of Marissa Marcel, a (fictional) actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.


It's up to players to find out what happened to Marcel, which, as in Barlow's previous games, involves slowly piecing together events by scouring through reams of FMV video. But while Her Story featured faux police interview footage and Telling Lies chose "hacked" webcam video as its medium of choice, Immortality asks players to dig through an archive of film and behind-the-scenes footage, using a machine resembling an old-fashioned Moviola editing device.

Core to Season 8 is a new faction system, enabling players to sign up to either the Pirate Lord's Guardians of Fortune or Flameheart's Servants of the Flame using the new Hourglass of Fate found on the Captain's Table of every ship.


Once active, players can either represent their faction simply by taking on any opposing crews they spot in the world, or they can use the war map to immediately begin matchmaking to find an equally skilled opposing crew. It's even possible to fight crews larger than your own if you're feeling particularly confident in your PvP abilities.

<blockquote><p>A cybersecurity expert examines how the powerful game whatever system is put before them, leaving it to others to cover the cost.</p>
<p>Schneier, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School and author of such books as <i>Data and Goliath</i> and <i>Click Here To Kill Everybody</i>, regularly challenges his students to write down the first 100 digits of pi, a nearly impossible task­&#8212;but not if they cheat, concerning which he admonishes, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get caught.&#8221; Not getting caught is the aim of the hackers who exploit the vulnerabilities of systems of all kinds. Consider right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who located a hack in the tax code: &#8220;Because he was one of the founders of PayPal, he was able to use a $2,000 investment to buy 1.7 million shares of the company at $0.001 per share, turning it into $5 billion&#8212;all forever tax free.&#8221; It was perfectly legal&#8212;and even if it weren&#8217;t, the wealthy usually go unpunished. The author, a fluid writer and tech communicator, reveals how the tax code lends itself to hacking, as when tech companies like Apple and Google avoid paying billions of dollars by transferring profits out of the U.S. to corporate-friendly nations such as Ireland, then offshoring the “disappeared” dollars to Bermuda, the Caymans, and other havens. Every system contains trap doors that can be breached to advantage. For example, Schneier cites &#8220;the Pudding Guy,&#8221; who hacked an airline miles program by buying low-cost pudding cups in a promotion that, for $3,150, netted him 1.2 million miles and &#8220;lifetime Gold frequent flier status.&#8221; Since it was all within the letter if not the spirit of the offer, &#8220;the company paid up.&#8221; The companies often do, because they’re gaming systems themselves. &#8220;Any rule can be hacked,&#8221; notes the author, be it a religious dietary restriction or a legislative procedure. With technology, &#8220;we can hack more, faster, better,&#8221; requiring diligent monitoring and a demand that everyone play by rules that have been hardened against tampering...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Its acclaimed sequel, which took the whole thing into glorious 3D, released into Steam early access in 2019, and proved hugely popular, selling 3m copies before the year was through. It's since got its full release on PC and consoles, and its most recent major update, the Survivors of the Void expansion, arrived in March this year.

Change is an integral part of the Kubernetes life-cycle: as Kubernetes grows and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with improvements for the health of the project. For Kubernetes v1.26 there are several planned: this article identifies and describes some of them, based on the information available at this mid-cycle point in the v1.26 release process, which is still ongoing and can introduce additional changes.
The Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is o…]]></summary>

Star Wars: Squadrons is something of a spiritual successor to LucasArts' beloved X-Wing and TIE Fighter games. It's set during the final days of the Galactic Empire, after the events of Return of the Jedi, and sees players engaging in deep space dogfights, both in multiplayer and in a bit of a solo campaign mode. There's even VR support if you're appropriately equipped.


Eurogamer enjoyed Star Wars: Squadrons when it released back in 2020, awarding it a Recommended badge and describing it as "an immersive space sim that's dazzling in VR [and] an exhilarating multiplayer experience, even if the story feels pedestrian."

Back in October, Crystal Dynamics launched a detailed questionnaire asking if the community would be interested in seeing the dark fantasy action-adventure series - which spanned five titles between 1996 and 2003 - make a comeback.


And the response, it turns out, was substantial. "In the past, we've found that surveys typically get between 1,000 and 3,000 responses," Crystal Dynamics and Eidos CEO Phil Rogers explained during parent company Embracer Group’s latest earnings call (thanks CVG), "but when we asked folk about Legacy of Kain, we received over 100,000 responses."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actor Scott Porter, who played Harry Osborn in Marvel's Spider-Man, has said he won't be reprising the role in Insomniac Games' upcoming PlayStation 5 sequel.


Porter - who recently portrayed Heimdall in God of War: Ragnarok - was heard in audio logs but only rarely glimpsed as Osborn in the first Spider-Man. However, post-credits sequences found in that game and its Mile Morales follow-up appeared to be setting the character up as Venom in Insomniac's "darker" Marvel's Spider-Man 2.


Given that Insomniac has already teased Venom as a major antagonist in next year's sequel, it seemed a distinct possibility Porter would also be making a return, but the actor has confirmed otherwise in a now-deleted tweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks the 20th anniversary of Ubisoft's much-loved (but distressingly absent) Splinter Cell series, and to mark the occasion the publisher has shared a smattering of concept art for its upcoming - but apparently still "very early" in development - remake.


All this comes via a special 20th anniversary developer roundtable video, culminating in a look at the future of the franchise. There's a brief mention of the Netflix animated series - which was announced last June and still in the works despite radio silence since then - and, of course, mention of the eagerly anticipated Splinter Cell reboot.


Ubisoft announced its remake -  described as a ground-up remake - last December, with producer Matt West saying, "We're going to update it visually, as well as some of the design elements to match player comfort and expectations, and we are going to keep it linear like the original games, not make it open world."

Speaking to IndieWire, Leguizamo recalled how his directors Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton "fought really hard for [him] to be the lead because [he] was a Latin man".


The actor stated that the studio had not initially wanted him to be a lead, but the directors' push to cast him eventually worked - something Leguizamo called "such a breakthrough" for the industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has, somehow, been a full year since Battlefield 2042 launched, and while it'd be premature to say DICE's shooter has bounced back from a disastrous launch it's certainly on firmer ground than it's been for a while. The belated launch of Season One in June was a small step in the right direction, while August's Season Two took bigger, bolder strides. Season Three, which kicks off on November 22nd, promises even more in the most radical season yet. 


What's most promising is the influx of players that should come as Battlefield 2042 hits Game Pass and EA Play, hopefully ensuring once sparse servers are fully-populated. It's part of a bigger push to get people playing Battlefield 2042, with free play periods for everyone across all platforms across December - on Xbox you can play for nada from December 1st-4th, on PC from December 1st-5th and on PlayStation from December 16th-23rd. 


Season Three - which has been dubbed Escalation - also makes some big changes, with the most profound being a return of sorts of the traditional class system to Battlefield, with specialists now being grouped by their roles. There's a new specialist in the mix, too, with Rasheed Zain joining the fray. He's a double-amputee whose traits include a faster health recharge and an airburst launcher.

Arkham City was first released in 2011, and has since been remastered for PS4 and Xbox One in the  Batman: Return to Arkham collection. Digital Foundry called this release a "mixed bag", and stated they thought the original PC release was the "definitive" release.
But the PC version of Arkham City has not had a remastered edition - something which modder GPUnity set out to change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A former employee of Final Fantasy publisher Square Enix has been arrested and accused of insider trading. 


38-year-old Taisuke Sazaki, whose video game credits include work on numerous Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts titles, allegedly bought shares in Japanese development company Aiming shortly before Square Enix publicly announced the studio was working on a new Dragon Quest mobile title.

Nippon reports that Sazaki acquired shares worth 20.8m yen (around £125k) between December 2019 and February 2020, after allegedly hearing details of Aiming's project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a little while since we heard about Sega's plans to make a Streets of Rage movie, but the project now seems to be gathering pace. 


Hollywood production company Lionsgate has now taken up the project's reigns, Deadline reported, following word earlier this year that Sonic the Hedgehog movie maker dj2 Entertainment was also involved.


More promising still is the news that Derek Kolstad, creator and lead writer of the hugely-lucrative John Wick franchise, remains attached, and will reportedly develop its script and act as a producer.

As perhaps expected, the game will run with 4K resolution and 60fps on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, while on PC (Steam) the frame rate can be boosted to 120fps depending on specs.


However, Xbox Series S owners should note that a day one patch will be required in order to hit 60fps, otherwise it'll be 30fps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parts of Grand Theft Auto 5's stolen source code have leaked online, and swiftly been removed via copyright strike by Rockstar.


The code in question is a string of scripting functions, as shared on reddit. It includes references to game elements like camera, graphics and cutscenes, as well as gangs and DLC. 


On its own, the leak isn't particularly enlightening about the next game in the series, but Rockstar's swift takedown proves the legitimacy of the recent leak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty players have found an easy way to unlock the M13B Assault Rifle, which is  controversially locked behind a challenge that can only be completed in the new DMZ game mode.  


Even more controversial is the fact that extracting the weapon only unlocks it for the player who picked it up instead of the entire squad. This means your squad will have to make repeated trips back to unlock it for everyone. 


Fortunately, it appears you won't have to after all. As you only need to extract with the gun at the end of a round, a squad mate can drop the weapon earned in a previous match for you to pick up. All you need to do now is extract safely and you unlock the weapon (thanks, PC Gamer).

The update was rolled out by Ubisoft on 8th November, and on the game's official website the developer listed the features included. The main feature was a new QB initiative  which has been in development for several months. "While we cannot share details of the update in order to protect its integrity," Ubisoft wrote, "we're confident of the solution we've been able to put in place."
The QB feature was rolled back yesterday to allow Ubisoft to work on fixes for it. In the eight days the feature was live, players took a look at the files to try and understand how the measure worked.

Yes, this will be yet another game to add to the ever-growing space-horror genre which is having quite the renaissance of late (looking at you Callisto Protocol, Dead Space Remake and Fort Solis).

Then, last week, Gordon took to Medium to share a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton's claims, releasing screenshots of emails and legal documents as evidence of the true timeline of events. He went on to allege abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton.

Discord server voice chat support for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S initially launched in September, but was somewhat hampered by its convoluted mobile app requirements.


Today's Xbox update streamlines the whole process, meaning users simply need to launch a Discord server via their console's Parties & chats > Discord option then pick a voice channel from their available Discord servers - and as long their Discord and Xbox accounts are linked, they'll be able to join that channel directly, no additional mobile app faff required.

This anonymised data - consisting of chat logs labelled by behaviours, from neutral to racist and sexist - will be used to better train AI-based preemptive moderation tools, helping them more effectively recognise and parse, and so detect and mitigate, disruptive behaviour in-game.

Some Modern Warfare 2 weapons will be locked behind challenges that can only be completed on other game modes. Most notably, the M13B Assault Rifle is locked behind a challenge in the game's new DMZ mode which will be releasing alongside Warzone 2.0. 


According to screenshots posted by the community, players can unlock the weapon by "defeating the chemist in the radiation zone of DMZ and extracting his dropped weapon."

On the monster front, there're no brand-new additions in Title Update 3, but some existing favourites do get a bit of a makeover. Elder Dragons Kushala Daora and Teostra, for instance, have now shaken off the affliction, only to emerge in Risen form - both available at Master Rank 120 or higher - causing them to become much more menacing when their anger peaks. 


Then there's the Chaotic Gore Magala, unlocked at Master Rank 10 or higher. This unfortunate beast has failed to complete the skin-shedding process that would normally see it turn into the Shagaru Magala, leaving it in a "deformed" halfway state that's able to use the attacks of both creatures. Sometimes, says Capcom, it will display "expressions of intense agony".

But, yes, it really has been that long. On 15th November 2002, Xbox Live (now known, at least officially, as the Xbox network) arrived in our lives, adding online capability to the original Xbox. 


The service's popularity saw a steady increase after the launch of Halo 2 and, needless to say, Microsoft has not looked back since. By January 2021, Microsoft reported there were more than 100m Xbox network subscribers (with this figure including those signed up through the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription tier).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a quick public service announcement for anyone seeking to subscribe to PlayStation Plus, including its pricier Extra and Premium tiers.


We're expecting Sony to slash the price of its subscriptions in time for Black Friday by 25 percent - making a year's worth of PlayStation Plus Premium cost £75 instead of £100.


Word of the upcoming deal comes from Dealabs, which has accurately given advance notice of Sony's monthly PlayStation Plus game line-ups for over a year now (thanks, VGC).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phil Spencer has admitted Microsoft has shipped games "too early".


Speaking to The Verge, the CEO of Microsoft Gaming was asked about the decision to delay Starfield and Redfall, two of the company's biggest upcoming exclusives.


"It isn't really a decision to move a game after spending the team's effort over multiple years just to get to a point where you know you're not going to deliver the game you want on the date that was promised," said Spencer. "Now, it is at some level, because I have shipped games too early. We have experienced shipping games too early."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six months after enjoyable open water survival adventure Raft drifted serenely out of Steam early access, developer Redbeet Interactive has announced it's adapting the game for consoles.


Raft, if you're unfamiliar, first gained attention as a free itch.io prototype back in 2016. After a two year spell expanding the game's core survival loop - in which players chart their raft across a vast ocean, reeling in food, supplies, and building materials to turn their initially tiny vessel into a veritable sea-faring palace - Redbeet launched into Steam early access in 2018.


Raft has come a long way since then, gaining the likes of online co-op, explorable islands, underwater reefs, crop growing, cooking, animal care, and even a full story campaign for its version 1.0 release on PC, which arrived this June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're still impatiently awaiting Amazon's live-action take on the Fallout universe, you might like a look at a newly released Fallout 76 fan project, admirably capturing the ambience of Bethesda's long-running series without, I assume, a budget of 150m Bezosbucks.


Created by YouTube channel Infectious Designer (which has also produced live-action shorts inspired by the likes of Half-Life, Killzone, and Watch Dogs), the Fallout 76 concept trailer serves up two minutes and 35 seconds of impressively realised Fallout splendour, replicating the series distinctive retro-futuristic aesthetic both before and after the nuclear apocalypse.


Now, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on Fallout 76 - about the only thing I can say with any confidence is that it's the 76th game in the Fallout series - but even to my eyes there's some lovely attention to detail in Infectious Designer's concept trailer, ranging from an authentic Pip-Boy and a hulking Vault suit to what I think is a CGI Scorchbeast. Oh and there's enough Nuka-Cola to rot the teeth clean out of your skull.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox boss Phil Spencer has revealed Microsoft's decision to "pivot away" from its previously announced Game Pass streaming box earlier this year was due to pricing concerns, with the company unable to get the device within its desired $99-$129 price bracket.


Speaking in the latest episode of The Verge's Decoder podcast (as spotted by VGC), Spencer explained, "The console we built that now people have seen...was more expensive than we wanted it to be when we actually built it out with the hardware that we had inside."


Microsoft never formally revealed this version of its streaming box, codenamed Keystone - a standalone device utilising a familiar Xbox user interface, according to Spencer - but it did set tongues wagging when a prototype showed up in a photo of the Xbox boss' office last month.

Much of Season 2's launch day changes focus on the Battle Pass experience, with Player First Games having tweaked progression so all tiers now offer rewards. It's also tuned the number of points required to complete each tier so the Battle Pass feels "engaging and rewarding".


As for those rewards, Season 2's Battle Pass unlocks the Baker Street Tom and Jerry skin at tier 50 of the free track, and the paid track features Astronaut Velma at tier 1, Tea Time Reindog at tier 42, and Maestro Bugs Bunny at tier 50.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin Bloom, the social walking game from Pokémon Go maker Niantic, recently passed its first birthday and is now hosting a special event themed around Pikmin 3. 


This event in particular caught my eye, as it will allow you to grow the series' original Red, Blue and Yellow Pikmin varieties dressed up in the space suits of Pikmin 3's main characters: Alph, Brittany, and Charlie.


If you're unfamiliar, Pikmin Bloom lets you potter about your neighbourhood growing flower trails and picking up Pikmin seedlings that can grow into Pikmin wearing costumes. If you're near a beach, for example, the Pikmin could be wearing a shell, or a discarded bottle cap if collected near a corner shop. It's a collection game and a glorified pedometer - and a cute nudge to get off your sofa once in a while.

Speaking via the Decoder podcast, Spencer said the company intended to sell Call of Duty on PlayStation "for as long as players want to play Call of Duty on PlayStation". 


Back in September, Spencer made a written commitment to PlayStation's Jim Ryan that Call of Duty will remain on PlayStation. However, Ryan labelled the statement "inadequate on many levels," while others point out that a commitment is not a legally binding contract.

US District Court Judge Thomas Zilly has ruled against AimJunkies' eyebrow-raising bid to countersue Bungie for allegedly accessing its computers - a retaliatory move which the cheating firm claimed amounted to the Destiny maker hacking it.


Now, a new ruling (first reported by Torrentfreak), has dismissed AimJunkies' defence and left Bungie looking likely to win its original complaint, which alleged that AimJunkie's cheating software infringed on Destiny's copyright and trademarks.

However, the trailer was already captured and reposted across the web, revealing major changes to the franchise's battle pass system. 


Activision has abandoned the linear progression of previous seasons of Call of Duty, opting instead for a "combat map" which gives players a sense of choice of what they unlock. It isn't a particularly novel idea, with many other live service games already using a modular battle pass model.

Earlier this month, a Steam version of Assassin's Creed Valhalla was spotted in Ubisoft Connect's database, prompting speculation the smash hit Viking adventure would finally arrive on Valve's PC storefront. To date, PC players have only been able to access Valhalla via Ubisoft's own launcher or the Epic Games Store.


A Steam version of Ubisoft sports title Roller Champions was also spotted - and today was also made briefly available to view on SteamDb, all but confirming the game will launch there. Roller Champions feels like it has struggled to find much of an audience to date; a Steam launch would certainly help it along.

Things are a little better on Xbox where Warzone 2.0 is discoverable with its own store page. Still, on closer inspection, the download confusingly also appears to bundle Modern Warfare 2 for free.

According to Far From Home, over 80,000 people played the Forever Skies demo, resulting in a "wave of positive and constructive feedback" the studio wants to implement before launching into Early Access - something it was initially planning to do before the end of this year.


"On the surface everything seemed great," Far From Home says of its recent feedback. "83% of respondents rated the demo as 8/10 or above. But when we looked deeper, we started seeing things that a lot of players said they missed."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An eye-catching Superman demo, made in Unreal Engine 5 and widely circulated online earlier this year, has been taken and sold on Steam as an $11 game.


The original proof-of-concept demo - titled A Superman Style Flight Experience (UE5) - was created by Toybox Games' Tyson Butler-Boschma, utilising the City Sample from Epic Games' The Matrix Awakens as a sandbox for superhero flight. In April, Butler-Boschma made the playable demo freely available via itch.io, but unfortunately, it's here things begin to go awry.


At the start of November, Butler-Boschma was alerted to the fact an entity calling itself Hero Game Studios had taken his demo - a project he created "for fun to show what could be made" in Unreal Engine 5 - and started selling it on Steam under the name Heroes City Superman Edition with an asking price of $10.99 USD.

Microsoft says it's publishing its inaugural Digital Transparency Report as part of its "long-standing commitment to online safety", with the aim being to release an updated report every six months so it can address key learnings and do more to "help people understand how to play a positive role in the Xbox community."


Much of the document is spent reiterating the various tools and processes Microsoft and Xbox players have at their disposal to ensure users remain safe and community guidelines are adhered to, ranging from parental controls to reporting.

Ok, ok, let's face it, Kratos was a bit of a knob in the past.


One NPC that would whole-heartily agree with me on this is the boat captain from the original God of War. Remember him? It is hard not to, as he was certainly put through it by Kratos. 

Please note, some of the below could be considered spoilers. If you're still reading and want to go into the God of War series blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

The revamped role-playing classic will offer the title of "Flamescale" for characters whose date of birth is listed as between 2nd and 25th May. However, the game then tells you "Flamescale" is actually not allowed, as it contains "banned words".


This issue, picked up by fan Choojermelon on Twitter (thanks, PCGamer) appears to stem from the name's inclusion of "mescal", the illegal psychedelic enjoyed by Hunter S. Thompson and others.

The demake trailer in question comes from creator Jackarte. It sees heroes Kratos and Atreus, as well as Ragnarök's towering god Tyr and the vengeful Freya, all reimagined as PlayStation 1 characters.

An upcoming fan-project known as Jurassic Park Operations from Krenautican sees action from the 1993 film reimaged in PlayStation's game creation system. And, I won't lie, it looks so good I had to do a double take to make sure I wasn't watching something from Spielberg himself.


While this project has evidently been in the works for a while, the team recently revealed its full trailer for the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An European Commission staff member has raised eyebrows for their public comments on the organisation's ongoing investigation into Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover bid - and prompted the EU Commission itself to respond. 


Last week, Commission member Ricardo Cardoso tweeted to say that the organisation was "working to ensure that you will still be able to play Call of Duty on other consoles (including my PlayStation)."


On the one hand, the comment simply describes the situation as Microsoft has too - that Activision's blockbuster shooter franchise will remain on Sony platforms "as long as there's a PlayStation out there to ship to". On the other, fans expressed surprise a Commission staff member was discussing the matter publicly, and expressing an opinion which seemed mostly concerned with their own console choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite has stunned fans by signalling an early end to its third map at the conclusion of its current season, via a live event named Fracture set to take place at 9pm UK time on 3rd December. 


Fracture was teased tonight by developer Epic Games at the conclusion of Fortnite Champion Series, its first major in-person Fortnite competition for several years. A title card for Fracture appeared after the tournament's trophy presentation, simply listing the upcoming live event's date, time, and description as the "Chapter 3 Finale event". 


Each in-game "Chapter" of Fortnite has so far concluded with a complete reboot of the battle royale's beloved Island. After two years and 10 seasons, the game's original Island got sucked into a black hole in October 2019. After another two years, this time divided into eight seasons, the game's second Island was flipped over to reveal the current map lying underneath in December 2021.

In an interview with IGN, Diablo 4 director Joe Shely and general manager Rod Fergusson opened up on what the new adventure has in store for fans of the franchise, as well as give a little insight into how the game's storytelling mechanics will differ from the Diablo games that have come before it.

"One of the concerns about putting 'open world' in a big neon and flashing that sign is that people have that notion of Breath of the Wild, 'oh, it’s completely organic and I can go anywhere and do anything'," Fergusson said, as transcribed by NME.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sony unveiled release details for PSVR2 earlier this month, it only confirmed two launch day titles - Horizon: Call of the Mountain and Quest 2 port Cities VR: Enhanced Edition. However, it turns out No Man's Sky fans also have something to look forward to, with Hello Games confirming to Eurogamer that its previously announced PSVR2 update will be arriving alongside Sony's new hardware on 22nd February next year.


Hello Games revealed a PSVR2 update for No Man's Sky was in the works back in June, teasing an enhanced VR experience that would utilise the power of PlayStation 5, PSVR2, and its new Sense controllers to build on the game's 2019 VR implementation, and "take that sense of immersion and believability up by several major notches."


Evidence that PSVR2 owners wouldn't have to wait long for No Man's Sky's promised VR upgrade first surfaced earlier this week when sharp-eyed PS5 Store users (by which I mean Eurogamer's resident VR aficionado Ian Higton) spotted an updated description on Hello Games' PSVR2 reveal trailer, pointing to a February 2022 release.

<p><i><a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/">A Hacker&#8217;s Mind: How the Powerful Bend Society&#8217;s Rules, and How to Bend them Back</a></i> isn&#8217;t about hacking computer systems; it&#8217;s about hacking more general economic, political, and social systems. It generalizes the term <i>hack</i> as a means of subverting a system&#8217;s rules in unintended ways.</p>
<p>What sorts of system? Any system of rules, really. Take the tax code, for example. It&#8217;s not computer code, but it&#8217;s a series of algorithms&#8212;supposedly deterministic&#8212;that take a bunch of inputs about your income and produce an output that&#8217;s the amount of money you owe. This code has vulnerabilities; we call them loopholes. It has exploits; those are tax avoidance strategies. And there is an entire industry of black-hat hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the tax code: we call them accountants and tax attorneys...</p>]]></summary>

Conroy, whose acting career began in the late 70s, first voiced Batman in Fox Kids' Batman: The Animated series, which would go on to run for 85 episodes between 1992 and 1995. His portrayal has remained a fan favourite ever since, with Conroy later voicing the role across a multitude of mediums, including 15 films.


In video games, he made his mark on the likes of developer Rocksteady's acclaimed Arkham trilogy, NetherRealm's superhero fighter Injustice, and, more recently, MultiVersus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week we heard the unusual news that player-versus-player MMO Crowfall, which launched in the summer of 2021, will be taken offline and taken back to the drawing board, where it will be rethought. There's no word on how long this will take, only that "nothing is off the table" in terms of what potentially may change.
Game operator Monumental said this was because it didn't have the headspace or resources to rethink the game while it was running it, and suggested Crowfall could return looking quite different indeed. If, that is, it returns. Crowfall has struggled since launch, and it was sold to Monumental in December 2021 partly because of this - because it needed significant change.
I cannot ever remember an MMO ever doing something similar. In this article, I talk to Monumental about the decision and what it could mean. But first, a bit of background.

The amount of detail Sony Santa Monica has put into its game is astounding, from animals scurrying through trees right down to Kratos' wrinkled elbows. But some of these details and Easter eggs are easily missed, so here is a small selection of ones that I have noticed so far. 

Please note, some of these details could be considered spoilers. If you're still reading and want to go into the game blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

Developer Sony Santa Monica recently stated that, while a photo mode would not be available on the game's launch, it would be coming further down the line by way of an update. This is much the same as with 2018's God of War. 


However, prolific modder Speclizer (who was responsible for unearthing the canned multiplayer map files in the Last of Us Part 2) has managed to find Ragnarök's photo mode and get it working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Thursday means another glimpse ahead at the Epic Games Store's next set of weekly freebies, with Evil Dead: The Game and tactical turn-based RPG Dark Deity both now confirmed to be free from Thurday, 17th November.


Evil Dead: The Game, which released as an Epic exclusive back in May, is developer Saber Interactive's spin on the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre. It sees four human Survivors (picking from a range of familiar Evil Dead characters, armed with everything from chainsaws to boomsticks) roaming a spooky forest in search of artefacts, while a fifth player gives chase as one of four powerful demons - the Warlord, Puppeteer, Necromancer, or Plaguebringer, all able to command undead armies of their own.


And it's good fun, effectively marrying the gleefully cartoonish horror of Sam Raimi's beloved franchise to a solidly entertaining multiplayer game.

Blood Origin isn't Netflix's first Witcher prequel, of course; last year saw the streaming service release an animated movie called The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, focusing on Geralt of Rivia's friend and mentor Vesemir.


Blood Origin, though, goes some considerable way further back in the series' timeline, telling a story set 1,200 years before Geralt and the events we're familiar with from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski's books, CD Projekt's games, and Netflix's existing TV show.

Blood Origin isn't Netflix's first Witcher prequel, of course; last year saw the streaming network release an animated movie called The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, focusing on Geralt of Rivia's friend and mentor Vesemir.


Blood Origin, though, goes some considerable way further back in the series' timeline, telling a story set 1,200 years before Geralt and the events we're familiar with from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski's books, CD Projekt's games and Netflix's existing TV show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mick Gordon, known for his work on soundtracks for several games including the Wolfenstein and Doom series, has released a statement in response to accusations made against him by Marty Stratton in May 2020.

In April 2020, Gordon distanced himself from the soundtrack album for Doom Eternal after it received criticisms from fans on its quality. This led to speculation from fans about its production, and Stratton, who was working as executive producer on Doom Eternal, posted an open letter to the Doom subreddit to address rumours. 

A year and a half later, Gordon has written a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton's claims, with screenshots of emails and legal documents (with sensitive information removed) as evidence of the true timeline of events. He posted his statement on Medium, in which he alleged abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton. Gordon stated he has released it to defend himself, and urged people to not use it as an excuse for a hate campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're discussing the now-widespread leaks of new Pokémon designs from the upcoming Scarlet and Violet games.

Pokémon details always leak - often months before launch, but especially in the last few weeks as retail copies begin appearing in the wild. Should you look at spoilers? For some, uncovering the many unannounced creatures as they play is a core part of the games. For others, knowing what your new Starter Pokémon will eventually evolve into is a big deal.  
Whichever side of the debate you're on, there's no doubting the level of interest in new Pokémon designs - seen this week when the final evolution of Starter cat creature Sprigatito sparked an avalanche of dubious fanart after an image was posted by a leaker. Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

This Escape From Tarkov-inspired mode is described as an "open-world, narrative-focused extraction mode where Operator squads have free rein to complete faction-based missions, take on additional side objectives, engage with enemy Operators or AI combatants, and search for valuable items, all while fighting to survive toward exfiltration".

Halo fan Epsilon_church_ posted word of their creation to Twitter yesterday evening and invited others to try the map for themselves. Amusingly, however, it needed to be named "Coagulation", as "BloodGulch" was blocked.

The cheapest of these tiers is Essential and is basically what PlayStation Plus once was. Users get online play, some other smaller perks and free PlayStation titles every month. Then we have Extra. This middle-ground tier includes everything that comes with Essential, but with the bonus of a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games to have a go at.


Then, finally, we have the most expensive of these tiers, known as Premium. This was marketed as a way for users to replay some of PlayStation's classic games from days gone by. The service covers every PlayStation console - from the original PS1 through to the PS5, as well as the PSP and, thanks to streaming, PS3 support.

Ditching the linear level progression still used by most games, Call of Duty's new battle pass will adopt a system reminiscent of that seen in Fortnite, where players have more freedom in which battle pass items they can unlock and when.


Activision's battle pass overhaul presents itself as a multi-sector map, with players able to unlock five items in each of its 20 sectors using earned Battle Token Tier skips. These tokens can either unlock more items within an already available sector or unlock adjacent sectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[20 months after developer SCS announced American Truck Simulator was setting its sights on Texas as one of its next destinations, the long-in-the-works expansion finally has a release date and is coming to Steam next Tuesday, 15th November.


Texas will be American Truck Simulator's 11th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. It was confirmed to be in development last March, but SCS warned the expansion could be a long time coming given the sheer effort required to bring one of the US' largest states into the game.


However, with Texas' arrival now less than a week away, SCS has given us our best look yet at the expansion's numerous familiar sights - its newly released  launch trailer featuring the likes of Austin, Houston, and a whole lot of countryside.

There's a lot more where that came from though, with Nintendo choosing to highlight over 20 promising new indie titles heading to Switch before next summer is through - a few of which, such as the wonderful Rogue Legacy 2, are out today. Read on for the full round-up!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disco Elysium game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have published an explosive open letter to fans detailing their ousting from ZA/UM, the game's development studio.
Most eye-opening is the claim ZA/UM's new majority shareholder, an Estonian firm named Tütreke OÜ, allegedly obtained control of the company through fraud. Tütreke OÜ is a "vehicle" for two Estonian businessmen, the pair wrote, namely Ilmar Kompus (now ZA/UM's CEO) and Tõnis Haavel (who was previously "convicted for defrauding investors on a different matter in 2007").


At the same time, ZA/UM CEO Kompus has published, via Estonian newspaper Ekspress, allegations of mismanagement by Kurvitz and a previous minority shareholder of the company, Saandar Taal. The pair are accused of "belittling women and co-workers" and creating a "toxic environment". Kompus also states the pair had been "intending to steal IP" - namely, Disco Elysium - with an eye to departing the studio and working elsewhere.

Servers for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin, and Dark Souls 3 were "temporarily deactivated" back in January following reports the games were vulnerable to Remote Code Execution exploits began to make headlines.


Several weeks later, Bandai Namco offered an update, saying the issue would't be addressed until after the release of Elden Ring, but Dark Souls fans' patience was finally rewarded in August when online features for Dark Souls 3 were restored. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin followed in October, with the publisher promising to reactive servers for the original Dark Souls 2 at "a later date".

This is the game's first major update which Volition previously said would be used to prioritise fixes and improvements over new content. Last month, the studio said it had chosen to spend time bringing the existing game up to scratch - even though it would have "preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions".

"Significant effort and testing" has gone into fixing the game's co-op, Volition said today. Connectivity, map issues and rewards should all work more smoothly post-patch.

But one major criticism has been the distinct lack of diversity in its main cast.


Last week, director Naoki Yoshida addressed the lack of diversity in an interview. It fits the "isolated nature of this realm" he said, as well as the inspiration of Medieval Europe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing can stop the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet leaks - not least the dozens and dozens of Pokémon fans already turning the game's latest still-officially-unannounced creature into somewhat dubious fan art.


If you ever need reminding how popular Pokémon is, simply type one of the creatures' names into social media and see how many image results you get. This is true even for Pokémon so far only glimpsed in leaked screenshots from early copies, images of which Nintendo is busy scrubbing from the internet.


Fan art created from seeing these leaked images, though, is another matter. For example, this morning I learned the final evolution of Grass-type cat and Scarlet and Violet Starter Pokémon Sprigatito had leaked online after I saw someone on Twitter discussing its design. (And if you're still reading and want to go into the new games blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.)

It's broken nature is so notorious, in fact, that Destiny developer Bungie has now added an Easter egg to the game where Telesto fails to properly fire - and instead sends its projectiles floating lazily into the sky while the weapon itself fizzes and sparks. (A simple reload clears the Easter egg, and the gun can then be used as normal.)


But while this appeared at first to be just a fun nod to Telesto's oft-bugged state, fans are now suggesting the Easter egg may hint at a further secret, as Destiny 2 heads towards the end of its current season.

Since launch, Wordle's puzzles have drawn from the same list of five-letter words - originally totalling 2,315, but now down by six - with a new word solution being presented each day. Starting today, though, that word list will be fully curated by Wordle's new dedicated editor, Tracy Bennett.


"Wordle's gameplay will stay the same," the publication explains in its announcement, "and answers will be drawn from the same basic dictionary of answer words". However, Bennett will be responsible for making "some editorial adjustments to ensure that the game stays focused on vocabulary that’s fun, accessible, lively and varied."

In a statement on its website, the European Commission said it had made the decision after its preliminary investigation showed Microsoft's acquisition may "significantly reduce competition on the markets for the distribution of console and PC video games, including multi-game subscription services and/or cloud game streaming services, and for PC operating systems".


It drew particular attention to its concerns Microsoft has a "potential economic incentive" to prevent competitors from accessing Activision Blizzard's "high-profile and highly successful games" upon closure of the deal, specifically highlighting the Call of Duty series - something Microsoft has repeatedly insisted it will not do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Awesome Games Done Quick's next charity speedrun event rapidly gaining on us, organisers have revealed timings for all 140+ speedruns scheduled for the January 2023 show.


Next year's Awesome Games Done Quick runs from 8th-15th January, and will once again be an online-only event as organisers look to move its in-person component away from its usual haunt of Florida. Earlier this year, organisers said the state's "continued disregard for COVID-19's dangers... and an increased aggression towards LGBTQ+ individuals" made it impossible to provide a "safe and welcoming" event for all.


While the lack of an in-person event might be a disappointment for some, Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 will still feature an extensive speedrunning schedule, running 24 hours everyday across the week with an occasional pauses for breaks. As ever, it's an eclectic line-up - covering triple-A titles, smaller-scale indie offerings, retro classics, and other assorted oddities (I can't pretend I'm not immediately intrigued by a game called Salamander County Public Television) - and you can have a leisurely peruse on the Games Done Quick website.

Each game will feature a separate book of expedition records with rare Pokémon to track down, letting you retrace their steps to encounter them yourselves. However, it sounds like the Scarlet Book and the Violet Book will feature alternate versions of these Pokémon, depending on which version of the upcoming games you have.


Put more simply: today's trailer appears to show a pair of new evolutions for Donphan. One is primal looking with huge tusks, which you'll meet in Scarlet. One is futuristic-looking with dot-matrix eyes, which you'll meet in Violet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus VR and creator of the Oculus Rift, has designed a new VR headset to celebrate the popular light novel and anime series Sword Art Online which can also kill you.

The plot of Sword Art Online revolves around a massive multiplayer online role-playing game in VR, which is played using a headset called the NerveGear. A number of players get locked into the game and the NerveGear can't be removed whilst a player is still online. And (spoiler alert) it'll kill a player in real-life if they die in the game. 

Luckey revealed his own version of this headset, named the OQPNVG, in a blog post on 6th November, to coincide with the day the events of Sword Art Online begin. (@SAO_IRL on Twitter is dedicated to broadcasting the events of the series as if it was actually happening, if a murder headset isn't enough realism for you.)

Bandai Namco went on to publish the first three games in the series, with Project Cars 3 releasing in 2020 - several months after EA had acquired Slightly Mad Studios as part of its takeover of Codemasters.

For comparison, in February of this year, the publisher shared it had sold 5m copies between then and the previous November. 


Even with this slow down in sales, the publisher stated the game has now sold more than 170m units worldwide.

For those closely following news around the announcement of the remake and its subsequent delays, there's not a lot new here. The game is still very much alive, Ubisoft promises, albeit no longer at its original development studio.


Still, the page is a handy place for fans to go for a bit of reassurance. Ubisoft has a habit of delaying games for years - looking at you Skull and Bones, and you Beyond Good & Evil 2, and you Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - without providing much proof they still exist.
