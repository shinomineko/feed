Whilst the "fresh" part of the moniker suggests this is a deal that should primarily interest lapsed players, Amazon says the "new servers will offer old and new players a chance to completely restart their New World experience as pre-existing high-level characters cannot be transferred in".

"It’s a great opportunity for new and lapsed players to experience all that has changed over the game's first year," the team said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayonetta 3 was reportedly "scoped as a semi open-world game".

That's according to games journalist Imran Khan, who offered an insider peek at the sequel's lengthy delay on his Patreon, reflecting on why those open world rumours seemingly didn't amount to anything in the end. 

"At one point in development, Bayonetta 3 was scoped as a semi-open world game," Khan wrote on a public Patreon post. "The design was going to draw more off Astral Chain than Nier Automata, but the idea was that a large hub world would send Bayonetta (or whoever else) to different worlds which would themselves be fairly open. Maybe Super Mario 64 would be a good reference point for this.

"Here is our updated Roadmap for Early Access!" exclaims Wales Interactive. "It does not list everything we are working on (we have to keep some things a surprise!) and is only a response to the majority of features requested in the Steam Forum, Steam Reviews and on the Discord."

The studio adds that the list "doesn't include many of the on-going development such as new episodes (and the base content released for each episode), optimisation, network improvements, balancing, UI and QOL etc" and confirms that the ping system, re-roll miracles, POV increase, enemy-auto-respawn times reduction and XP levels have already been addressed.

The former is interesting not just because of her "rare narrative screen appearance", as The Hollywood Reporter puts it, but also because the Spice girl is married to team principal of Red Bull's Formula One team, Christian Horner.

Sony's live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Stranger Things' David Harbour was the first member of the cast to be officially revealed with the news he'll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who's helming the project.

Sharp-eyed fans first spotted the mysterious new Pokémon during a segment on Scarlet and Violet's photo mode, its round grey head and twin antenna barely visible behind a chunk of UI.


There've been no further sightings following that discovery, and developer GameFreak is yet to reveal more, but a new Pokémon Go update has now, albeit inadvertently, kicked the little fella into the spotlight sooner than intended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Capcom's stupendous 2011 paranormal puzzle adventure about posessing inanimate objects, might be making a comeback, with the South Korean ratings board having now listed it for release on PC.


Ghost Trick, for those unlucky enough to have never made its aquaintance, was created by Shu Takumi, best known as the designer of Capcom's much-loved Ace Attorney series. It follows the adventures of Sissel, who wakes at the beginning of the game in spirit form, inches from his corpse, with little recollection of his past. It soon transpires, though, that while Sissel has lost his memories, he's gained some new abilities - ghost tricks, you might say! - in their place. 


From that point on, progress is generally made by watching scenes play out - Ghost Trick has a wonderfully engaging story - then rewinding back to figure out a way of influencing events to change their outcome, usually by possessing different items around the evironment and then bringing them to life at the right moment.

The Pastel Pop Kit ushers in a selection of home furnishings and decorative additions - including mirrors, shelves, and desk items - with a focus on the "simple and psychedelic". That means "quirky pastel prints, irregular shapes, and vintage vibes" inspired by 60s and 70s design.


Next week's second DLC, the Everyday Clutter Kit, does pretty much exactly what it says in the title, introducing items that can be used to give homes a "loved and lived-in" look - ranging from coffee mugs to magazine stacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK's second Neo Geo Pocket Color compilation for Switch and PC - which the publisher is sensibly calling Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection V2 - will be making its way to Steam and Nintendo's eShop next Wednesday 9th November. 


As with volume 1, which released last September, this second collection bundles together 10 gaming favourites from SNK's short-lived but much-loved Neo Geo Pocket.


Somewhat unhelpfully, SNK is yet to announce what those 10 games will be, but sharp-eyed readers with better SNK knowledge than me might find some clues in the accompanying announcement artwork below. Inevitably, there's no pricing details yet either, but expect it to be similar to volume 1, available on Steam and eShop for £29.99/£35.99 respectively.

Celebrating the series' 20th anniversary, Insomniac Games senior community manager Aaron Jason Espinoza announced today on the PlayStation Blog that five more games will be added to the subscription service.



Sadly that doesn't include the duo's latest PS5 adventure, which released in June 2021 and was considered something of a showpiece for the console.

On a brighter note, Ho Ho Holiday adds a new story, 20 more toys to put in your fireplace, and 50 fresh combinations to uncover as you incinerate certain objects at the same time.

Speaking to IGN, Yoshida was asked to comment on responses to the latest trailer that features mostly white characters.


Yoshida admitted it was a difficult question to answer, but that the lack of diversity fits the "isolated nature of this realm" - Valisthea, where the game takes place.

The two-and-a-half-minute footage shows an in-game scene with a character who looks a lot like Margaret Qualley - someone fans will recognise from her role as Mama in Kojima's previous game Death Stranding. 


The video looks as if it was originally designed for internal use, as it also features a feed of someone apparently playing the scene. All of this has then been videoed by someone else, off of a very reflective screen which shows the man taping the footage to be lying in bed half-naked. Lovely.

The past year has seen a flurry of mergers and acquisitions within the video game industry, with Microsoft following up its Bethesda purchase by launching its attempt to buy Activision Blizzard, while Sony has gobbled up Bungie and Take-Two has taken on Zynga.


Don't expect the Death Stranding developer to follow suit, however - even as Kojima looks to be building new games for both Microsoft and Sony.

Blue Box, the developer of Abandoned, gained internet fame for continually teasing that there was more to its survival horror game than met the eye. Fans pounced on the suggestion it was linked to Kojima, or was one of the many Silent Hill projects in production. Neither is the case.


"Users just kept sending me pictures of this Hasan [Kahraman, Abandoned's creator]. They still send me collages and deepfake images - like 20 a day. It's really quite a nuisance! [laughs] This has been going on for almost two years now," Kojima said, speaking in the latest episode of his Spotify podcast.

This blog post was inspired by a previous Kubernetes blog post about
Advanced Server Side Apply.
The author of said blog post listed multiple benefits for applications and
controllers when switching to server-side apply (from now on abbreviated with
SSA). Especially the chapter about
CI/CD systems
motivated me to respond and write down my thoughts and experiences.
These thoughts and experiences are the results of me working on Kluctl
for the past 2 years. I describe Kluctl as "The missing glue to put together
large Kubernetes deployments, composed of multiple smaller parts
(Helm/Kustomize/...) in a manageable and unified way."
To get a basic understanding of Kluctl, I suggest to visit the kluctl.io

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares has shared a first gameplay trailer for its upcoming remake of Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened - the studio's Lovecraft-themed crossover from 2007 - alongside news that the project will be launching early next year.


Frogwares revealed its plans for a "full remake and substantial rewrite" of The Awakened back in July, launching a Kickstarter campaign shortly after to secure additional funding to complete the game - a step the Ukranian studio said was necessary due to complications arising from Russia's ongoing invasion. 


Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, in its new guise, will rework the events of the original to serve as a continuation of the studio's young Sherlock arc, which began in last year's enjoyable Chapter One. As such, it'll follow a young Sherlock Holmes, along with his new acquaintance John Watson, on his first big case in London - an investigation soon leading to a Cthulhu-worshipping cult and other Lovecraft-inspired horrors.

Schachner - whose extensive CV includes composing credits on the likes of Anthem, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare - was widely praised for her work on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's soundtrack in 2019.


Schachner returned for this year's Modern Warfare 2, but has now confirmed she won't be providing any further music for the title - or indeed Call of Duty: Warzone - as a result of seemingly insurmountable work concerns.

Ahead of that, though, we got a taste of some of the titles that'll be in attendance courtesy of a brand-new Day of the Devs livestream. You'll find everything that got an airing - some of it new, some of it not - detailed below, but if anything takes your fancy, it's worth checking out the livestream, which contains plenty of new footage from each game.

Mina the Hollower


Mina the Hollower is Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games' latest retro-inspired project, a challenging action-adventure RPG inspired by the Game Boy Colour. Landing somewhere between Link's Awakening and Bloodborne, it's "a bone chilling new adventure" starring a whip-wielding inventor mouse whose attacks are intentionally slow - meaning spacing and timing is crucial during combat. Mina also has a signature burrowing technique preventing her from being damaged when underground, and an upgrade system that requires collecting bones from defeated enemies to level up different skills. There's no release date for Mina the Hollower yet, but it's currently "deep in development".

        <updated>2022-11-03T20:50:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD has revealed its first RDNA 3 graphics cards, the $1000 Radeon RX 7900 XTX and $900 RX 7900 XT. As the numbering scheme and price points indicate, these are high-end models designed to compete with Nvidia's RTX 4090 and 4080, but they come with more substantial changes than you might expect - including FSR 3, designed to counter Nvidia's DLSS 3 frame generation, and a brand new chiplet-based design.


Before we get into the features though, let's take a look at the cards themselves. The chiplet design breaks a traditional monolithic GPU into several interconnected sections. For RDNA 3, that's a single 5nm graphics compute die (GCD) that's 300mm² and six 6nm memory cache dies (MCDs) that are each 37mm². This design means that only the most critical areas need to be made with a cutting-edge 5nm process, helping to improve CPU yields, reducing costs and ultimately consumer prices. However, it also requires a fast interconnect between the different chips - which runs at 5.3TB/s here. This same chiplet approach worked brilliantly with Ryzen, transforming AMD from an also-run to a growing giant, so it'll be fascinating to see how it if works miracles in the GPU space too.


Each of the dies are impressive in their own right. The memory cache die uses a 64-bit memory controller and a second-gen Infinity Cache, which combine to provide 2.7 times the peak bandwidth of RDNA2 designs. Meanwhile, the graphics compute die offers unified RDNA 3 compute units with hardware for stream processing, AI acceleration and RT. The design also decouples shader and front end clocks speed, with 2.3GHz for the former and 2.5GHz for the latter, which AMD says will result in a more efficient design - with up to 25 percent power savings in terms of shaders and 15 percent higher front-end clock frequency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to Sony's eye-opening announcement of its PlayStation VR2 pricing, alongside Eurogamer's resident VR superfan and advocate Ian Higton as a special guest.

The PSVR2 is a high-end device and it was never going to be cheap, but its £530 cost (£570 if you actually also want something to play) has placed it out of reach for many console players  - let alone those without a PS5 already. Of the many headset options available, Sony's was expected to be the most likely to attract a wider audience and grow the budding VR scene. But with that price, and a line-up of games you can mostly play elsewhere, why not choose another option - if you are interested in VR at all? 
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Ishraq Subhan join Ian and me as we discuss why the headset costs so much, what Sony could do to sweeten the deal, and what future we think PSVR2 now has at that price point.

But the community now thinks filling up all five attachment slots in MW2 may not be optimal, with drawbacks for many attachments not outweighing the benefits.

As well as the weapon model itself, sounds, animations, and customisability have all been ported over from MW2. The end result is a group of weapons that feel incredibly realistic in a game where weapon feel isn't a strong point. 


Current weapons available to download are the M4 assault rifle and Signal 50 sniper rifle, with plans to add more down the line.

Last week we reported that Sony had seemingly removed expiry dates from PS Plus, with only one game listed in the Last Chance to Play tab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard has filed a last-minute attempt to delay the counting of votes from some of its workers seeking to form a union.


Last month, Blizzard's Albany-based band of Diablo testers formally  won the right to form a union following a months-long process. Ballots were subsequently sent out, with the result due to be announced on 18th November. 


Now, Activision Blizzard has entered a motion to impound those ballots, GamesIndustry.biz reports. The company's top brass is currently appealing the Diablo testers' ability to unionise, and claims any announcement of the results would prejudice future results.

Reddit user InterventX shared a mockup of what a more functional user interface would look like, which as it turns out just looks like the interface from Modern Warfare (2019). 


Eagle-eyed fans have pointed out Infinity Ward got a new UX/UI Director following Modern Warfare's launch in 2019. William Faler joined the studio in October 2020, having previously been the head of UX at the American streaming platform Hulu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has finally got around to sharing more concrete information on Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope's season pass, which has been available to purchase for some time now, breaking down the three content drops owners will receive throughout 2023.


First up is The Tower of Doooom, planned for launch in "early 2023". This sees Madame Bwahstrella enlisting Mario, Rabbid Peach, and pals to help save her friend Spawny - a task that'll require players to battle their way to the top of the titular tower in what Ubisoft is calling a "highly strategic" new combat game mode.


The Tower of Doooom will be followed by a currently unnamed second DLC instalment in "mid 2023", taking players to an "enchanting" new planet. Here, they'll be able to "explore new environments, meet fun characters, discover secrets, and face off against new enemies."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced a last-minute delay for the PlayStation 5 version of Football Manager 2023, citing "unforeseen complications which have arisen during the submissions and approvals process."


Football Manager 2023 was to mark the series long-awaited debut on PlayStation 5, with Sport Interactive boss Miles Jacobson having previously blamed its absence on Sony's unwillingness to send dev kits to the studio. "To make games for a platform, you need a dev kit," he explained in 2020. "To get a dev kit, the platform holder has to want the game on the platform. We spoke with Sony, we have no dev kits. We spoke with Microsoft, they sent them to us."


Football fans with PS5s finally got the news they'd hoping for earlier this year, when Sports Interactive revealed Football Manager 2023 would be heading to Sony's platform on 8th November. Now, however, the studio has been forced to announce an indefinite delay for the title due to "unforeseen complications" relating to Sony's submissions and approvals process.

Writing in a now-deleted post on reddit  (thanks, PC Gamer), the first-person shooter fan stated they had been stopped by a security guard after entering the car park of the company's office in Austin, Texas on Monday, 31st October. 


The fan says they "politely" asked to be let into the office to complain about their "wrongful" Modern Warfare 2 ban, having spent $140 on a special edition version of the game. The fan was refused entry, and told to wait for customer support to resolve the issue.

Proposal five, submitted by Harrington Investments, cites the potential impacts of being involved with development of weapons for the US military. 
Both proposals include statements made publicly by Microsoft employees about their disagreement on involvement with military contracts.

Speaking to investors in a financial briefing last night, EA said it had a "major IP" due to arrive before 31st March next year - but that it was holding off on its big reveal until nearer the time.


The sequel to 2019's popular Jedi: Fallen Order is really the only thing on EA's slate this "major IP" without a release date could be. We already know the launch dates of EA's upcoming Need for Speed return, its Dead Space remake and its collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Wild Hearts.

Yesterday, we got to see Ben Stiller leading a group therapy session with John Travolta, LeBron James and their children, and today we get to witness Japan's newest Ragnarök trailer.


This trailer is an upbeat little number complete with its own (quite catchy) song and dance routine. The parent in me likens it to Australian children's music group The Wiggles, but with weapons added in to give it that bit extra. It is quite something, and I sort of love it. See it for yourself below.

That's according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who made the claim in a tweet accompanying today's news of Square Enix Montréal's closure.


Although no further details on the new Deus Ex project were shared, this would seemingly be the first known instance of a major Square Enix IP being revived under Embracer Group's watch since it acquired the likes of Tomb Raider, Thief, and Deus Ex - plus Square Enix Montréal, Eidos-Montréal, and Crystal Dynamics - as part of a $300m deal in May.

In its Square Enix Montréal guise, Onama was a predominantly mobile-focused developer, perhaps best known for its Go series of puzzles games. It was working on Tomb Raider Reloaded, Avatar Generations, and a new Space Invaders game when it was acquired by Embracer Group alongside Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal in May.


As reported by Bloomberg, however, Embracer Group today informed staff it will be closing the studio in a move the company says will affect around 200 employees. Bloomberg's sources claim some members of the Onama team will be transferred to Eidos-Montréal, although it's unclear how many employees will be left without jobs following today's news.

From today, 1st November, until Sunday, 6th November, players can find four Doctor-Who-themed costume sets in Fall Guys' premium item shop, costing 800 Show-Bucks apiece.


There's one inspired by Tom Baker's legendary fourth Doctor, one based on Jodie Whittaker's incarnation, and a third modelled after the latest David Tennant regeneration - which the BBC is officially referring to as the Fourteenth Doctor - as seen at the end of showrunner Chris Chibnall's recent swansong The Power of the Doctor.

There'll also be a "new helpful tutorial" to assist new players into Dwarf Fortress' labyrinthine ways, as well as a fresh soundtrack and UI.

The trailer in question sees Ben Stiller (yes, of Dodgeball fame) dressed up as Kratos, as he leads a group therapy session with John Travolta, LeBron James and their children. Apparently, the father and son relationship we see in God of War between Kratos and Atreus is key to these famous faces nurturing their own parent-child bonds.


The resulting trailer is described as "a Super Bowl-level spot", which you can see below.

Fixing the bug involved Pokémon Go developer Niantic briefly disabling the game's Bluetooth device support - used by auto-catching accessories such as the officially-licensed Go Plus device and unofficial Gotcha wristband.


Support for these gadgets was re-enabled this morning when the bug was fixed, following a weekend of fan fury directed at Danger.

Ice Wall is a useful ability which can block the opposing team's path and line of sight. Players found a novel way to use it, but not without some bugs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got word there was a Monkey Island-like game in the works. This in itself is not exactly unusual - point and click games have always been around, even if they are not as prevalent as they once were. 


But this Monkey Island-like game has something else going for it that made my ears prick up. Not only is it described as a "merry and macabre point and click adventure game" by its developers, but it also happens to have Jonathan Ackley (Curse of Monkey Island's co-director) giving it his seal of approval. Colour me interested!


The game in question is Foolish Mortals, and it comes from the minds at Inklingwood Studios - you can see a teaser for it below. Heavily inspired by the Monkey Island series, this game takes place in an exotic locale and, as luck would have it, there is a demo for it available right now on Steam. So, of course, I headed on over to give this upcoming release a whirl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite is hosting a Star Wars week, and introducing skins for Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Han Solo alongside a range of classic trilogy-themed acessories.


Each of the three skins includes multiple designs based on costumes worn throughout the original trilogy - so, Luke in his white farmhand tunic but also his darker Return of the Jedi look, while Leia rocks her bounty hunter disguise as well as her iconic ear buns.


The game's ever-popular Lightsaber weapons are back, as is the return of Darth Vader and various Stormtroopers to defeat. In a nice touch, the Junk Rift item (which plummets an object onto a specific location, squashing anyone below it) can now drop Luke's landspeeder.

PlayStation Plus had  45.4 million subscribers as of 30th September this year, down more than two million from the 47.2 million signed up at the same point in 2021.


Sony relaunched its PlayStation Plus subscription in June, when it split the service into three tiers and launched a Game Pass-style catalogue of games for those paying more.

It's still something of a rarity for major game developers to specifically include non-binary representation in addition to male and female. But for the Harvestella team, its inclusion feels "completely normal", producer Daisuke Taka told Eurogamer.


"I think it's completely normal these days for non-binary to be included in gender selection," Taka said.

Netflix shared the news - which comes just shy of a year since the streaming service took its first tentative steps into gaming - on its website, saying Spry Fox's focus on "cosy, original" games would help it "accelerate our creative development in another beloved genre and add to the growing variety of Netflix's games catalogue that will have something for everyone."


It's unclear what today's news means for Spry Fox's previously announced publishing partnership with Epic Games, which was intended to result in a "multiplatform nonviolent persistent" MMO "designed to encourage friendship and reduce loneliness in the world".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playground Games' long-awaited Fable reboot continues to staff up with the news that Andrew Walsh, whose credits include senior writer on Horizon Forbidden West and associate narrative director on Horizon Call of the Mountain, has joined the team.


Walsh - whose writing career has spanned everything form The Division 2 and Prince of Persia to UK TV shows Emmerdale and Byker Grove - revealed his new role on Twitter, writing, "So, Albion has beckoned once again. I'm delighted to announce that I've had the chance to join the wonderful team [at Playground] working on the new Fable!".


As his tweet implies, this won't be Walsh's first dalliance with the Fable series; he was also lead writer on Fable Legends, the ill-fated free-to-play multiplayer-based spin-off, which was cancelled in 2016 when Microsoft made the decision to close developer Lionhead Studios.

Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord, a collaboration between Sony Pictures Virtual Reality and developer nDreams, promises to unleash an "extensive and engrossing" spirit-bothering adventure playable either solo or co-operatively with up to three friends. 


It also waves goodbye to the series' traditional home of New York City and makes the jump to San Franciso, taking players on a tour of some familiar sights - including the Golden Gate Bridge - as they attempt to thwart the titular Ghost Lord and his army of malevolent spirits.

The team that worked on Valve's first-person puzzle adventure masterpiece have openly talked about cut content in the past. At the Games Developer Conference in 2012, writers Erik Wolpaw and Chet Faliszek talked about features that were cut such as Garfield references, multiple endings, and Wheatley's early demise. Later that year at PAX Prime, Wolpaw also revealed Valve had planned to have protagonist Chell marry a turret during the game.

10 years on, speaking to Did You Know Gaming, Josh Weier has weighed in with his own insight on why these bits were cut and where they stemmed from during development.

One such modder is Raq (whose name you may recognise from our Tomb Raider Anniversary piece). They have created the Elena mod for Legacy of Thieves which, as I am sure you have guessed already, puts Elena into the spotlight by reskinning series hero Nathan Drake as his wife.
I am a big fan of the Uncharted series as a whole, and of Elena Fisher especially (you may be able to spot a poster of her on my wall during Newscasts). With this mod being a particularly notable one for me, I contacted Raq to find out more about why they siezed the chance to bring Elena to the fore.

Waikuteru (whose name you may recognise from the Breath of the Wild 'Second Wind' mod) worked with fellow modder Sockpoppet to create this haunting DLC. It includes new challenges, armour, weapons and NPCs. Oh, and there is also a new boss to defeat - The Phantom Rider.


"The time of the year has come and so came the mysterious creature too," proclaims a bodiless voice in the DLC. This voice then bids Link to make haste to Korok Forest,  to help these spirits of Hyrule before it is "too late".

Over the weekend, God of War creative director Cory Barlog said it was "completely fucking stupid" fans have to "dodge the spoilers" after retailers began selling Ragnarök  copies well ahead of the game's official launch on Wednesday 9th November - still more than a week away. 


Now, Sony Santa Monica has offered its own less-sweary official comment, asking fans to be considerate of others, and advising those who wish to remain unspoiled to "mute any keywords or hashtags associated with the game until release day" when browsing social media.

Since the game's reveal, fans have made the comparison with Nintendo's adventure due to Sonic Frontiers' lush green open setting and that hero shot of the hedgehog looking out over a wide landscape.


But in an interview with Shacknews (spotted by TheGamer), Iizuka has clarified that Sonic Team's game is more linear and - for the millionth time - open zone, not open world.

The Store is Closed - which we told you about a couple of weeks ago - is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games' The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy. 

Whilst it doesn't use any of Ikea's products, names, or branding, Ikea believes the developer is infringing on its copyright and has sent in New York legal firm Fross Zelnick. Consequently, Ziggy - who's based in the UK - has ten days to make the changes or face legal action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another day, another Steam concurrent user record broken. This time, it comes just days after Steam hit 30m concurrent players and sees Valve's PC gaming client clock up a giant 30,049,264 simultaneous players.

That said, whilst that figure comes from SteamDB, Steam itself states the all-time peak is a more modest 30,044,046. In either case, though, it's proof that PC gaming remains on the rise, even if the majority of those players were idling at the time (SteamDB estimates "just" 8.9 million were actively in-game at the time the record was set).

Steam numbers have been rising since the pandemic began in 2020, with a previous previous peak of just under 30 million set back in March this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luminous Productions has kicked off an all-new behind-the-scenes series for its upcoming action-PRG, Forspoken.

The first of a three-part series, "Magic Parkour" focuses on protagonist Frey Holland and - predictably enough - her "magic-enhanced parkour" and traversal skills. We also get to see "the variety of spells at her disposal giving players a taste of what to expect when the game launches". You can check it out below:

The next video - slated to drop on 3rd November - will focus more on Forspoken's combat "and dive into the fundamentals of Frey's magical combat skills" by sharing more about the types of magic, attacks, and upgrades we'll be able to unlock. The final video, out 10th November, showcases the quests, challenges and activities players will "find and accomplish" in the world of Athia.

In the statement, Square Enix said it was "critical for [its] business that [it] produce hit titles that speak to the global market".

"For our Group to better focus on developing titles for the global market in this changing environment, we need to concentrate our limited resources on the development of strong and robust titles," the company said.

In a tweet overnight, Infinity Ward confirmed that it was "aware that some players [are] experiencing crashes when partied up" and invited players to "stay tuned" whilst it investigation the cause of the issue.

A few hours later, Infinity updated the message and whilst it stopped short of giving a specific deadline as to when the issue will be resolved, it did confirm that a fix would be coming sometime on Saturday 29th October (afternoon/evening for Europeans, morning for Americans in the Pacific Daytime Time zone).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncharted and The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog is working with a number of other PlayStation Studios teams to develop a mysterious new project in a "beloved franchise".


That's according to a newly spotted Sony job listing (thanks VGC) seeking a game design intern to work at a "new PlayStation studio based in San Diego... co-developing an exciting new project with Naughty Dog in a beloved franchise." There's no additional information about the new studio, but it seems highly likely it's the same San-Diego-based "new internal game develop team" Sony referenced in a different job listing earlier this week.


That earlier job advert initially revealed the new team was being built to collaborate on a new "high visibility" project with Naughty Dog and Visual Arts - Sony's San-Diego-based support studio that most recently worked with Naughty Dog on its The Last of Us: Part 1 remake. However, a later edit removed the explicit reference to Visual Arts, for reasons unknown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe's ambitious The Duviri Paradox expansion has been delayed into 2023 - but there're still a couple of treats heading to the free-to-play sci-fi shooter before the end of the year, including a mini prequel going by the name of Lua's Prey.


The Duviri Paradox is Warframe's latest open-world expansion - following the likes of Plains of Eidolon and Heart of Deimos - and plunges players into the extremely weird world of Duviri, a fantasy-western-themed kingdom existing inside the mind of new big bad Dominus Thrax. More striking, though - and there's a lot of eye-catching stuff, from its stark black and white aesthetic to its skeletal horse steed - is its new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees developer Digital Extremes "flirting with rogue-like elements".


It's intriguing stuff then, but while The Duviri Paradox was initially due to launch some time in "winter 2022", Digital Extremes has now confirmed it's pushing the expansion's release back into 2023. The studio didn't offer much on the reason behind the delay, only saying it was "to deliver the best experience possible."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firaxis' Marvel-themed strategy game Midnight Suns will be adding the likes of Venom, Morbius, and Storm as paid DLC starting in early 2023.


Marvel's Midnight Suns, if you're unfamiliar, draws inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s to deliver a superhero strategy game blending turn-based combat, card-battling, and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building. At launch on 2nd December, it'll include 12 playable heroes, ranging from the immediately familiar - think the Avengers and X-Men - to perhaps lesser-known characters from the likes of the Runaways.


However, publisher 2K has now confirmed Midnight Suns' roster will begin to expand in early 2023, when Deadpool joins the line-up as premium DLC. Deadpool arrives in the first of four planned DLC packs - all included in a season pass or available to purchase individually - with each one adding a new hero (plus their respective abilities), new story missions, upgrades for the Abbey, plus new skins and outfits.

The map, initially called Marina Bay Grand Prix, was announced back in August during the Call of Duty (eSports) League Championship Weekend and was seemingly inspired by the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore.


But in September, any mention of the map was purged from all of Call of Duty and Infinity Ward's social media accounts, as well as any trailers on its YouTube channel. The map was also missing during the multiplayer open beta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox and PC players have found their ability to disable crossplay in Modern Warfare 2 has disappeared. 


The crossplay toggle allows players to choose whether they matchmake with players from other platforms. 


Console players tend to disable crossplay to avoid matching against PC players using keyboard and mouse or may be hacking. On the flip side, PC players may wish to avoid console players who have aim assist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontier has announced it is ending post-launch support for its inaugural F1 Manager sim less than two months after release, saying its next patch will be the game's last major update as it moves staff elsewhere to "ensure upcoming F1 Manager projects realise their potential".


F1 Manager 2022, which launched at the end of August, is the first of four games planned for release under Frontier's new F1 licensing deal. It put players in the role of a team principal, challenging them to lead their "drivers, engineers and fans to glory in the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Drivers' World Championship and FIA Formula 1 Constructors' World Championship".


While F1 Manager 2022 received a decent critical reception at launch, it's drawn criticism among players for shallow, undercooked features and a significant number of bugs. Many had hoped at least some of these issues would be properly addressed through robust post-launch support, but Frontier has now called time on further development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10 years after its introduction, Steam's Big Picture mode has received a long overdue overhaul, with Valve finally making good on last year's promise to replace the ageing UI with its decidedly more modern Steam Deck interface - albeit initially only for testing prior to a general release.


Steam's Big Picture mode first surfaced back in 2012, introducing an optional new UI for Valve's storefront specifically designed for use with televisions and controllers. It's changed in barely noticeable increments since then, lagging far behind Valve's recent major overhaul for Steam's desktop mode, but as of today, it's out with the old and in with the new. 


Just as it promised last July, Valve has now replaced the old Big Picture mode with the far more modern UI created for its handheld gaming PC, Steam Deck. "This controller-first interface was designed for Steam Deck in handheld and docked mode," Valve explains, "and is perfect for all the scenarios Big Picture mode currently handles."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's all looking a bit Sonic the Hedgehog as the year nears its end; not only does the blue streak make his video game return next month in Sonic Frontiers, Netflix has confirmed its 3D animated series Sonic Prime is hitting the streaming service on Thursday, 15th December.


Sonic Prime was announced last February, after a bit of a premature reveal toward the end of 2020, with Netflix promising a 24-episode series that would send Sonic on a "journey of self-discovery and redemption" in which the "fate of a strange new multiverse" was in his hands.


Since then, we've had teases, plus a slightly more revealing 40-second trailer, confirming appearance from Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Big the Cat - who appears to be having something of a renaissance this year, seeing as he's also been sighted in Sonic Frontiers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five years after developer Jumpship formally unveiled its side-scrolling sci-fi apocalypse adventure Somerville, a release is in sight, with the studio having somewhat unexpectedly announced a 15th November launch on Xbox One and PC earlier today.


Jumpship is an independent studio founded by film animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Dino Patti, co-founder and former CEO of Limbo studio Playdead. And while Somerville's formal reveal came in 2017, Olsen - who has worked the likes of Skyfall and The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron - had already been tinkering away on the project for three years before that.


Somerville - described as a "hand-crafted narrative experience set across a vivid rural landscape" that sees players navigating perilous terrain "to unravel the mysteries of Earth's visitors" - has continued to look wonderfully intriguing since its big reveal. However, it's been nearly a year since its most recent public showing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern Warfare 2's full release is just around the corner, and ahead of this developer Infinity Ward is keen to clear some things up - notably that, despite some similarities in missions, the game is not running a "commentary" on the world's current events.


"It's an entertainment adventure," Call of Duty narrative director Brian Bloom explained recently (via PCGamesN). "And as far as real people and real places doing real things, you know, these are not based on actual events."


Bloom went on to state the team is, however, inspired by real-world events. "We want you to feel like when you play the game, it's happening in the world that you live in, and our heroes are here to do things that put the world back the way it was, in the way we left it, to restore it," he continued.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Apex Legends' 15th season, Eclipse, mere days away now, developer Respawn is finally ready to discuss Catalyst, the free-to-play battle royale game's newest hero, in more detail, breaking down the abilities she'll bring to the latest round of the Apex Games.


Speaking at a recent press briefing, Respawn explained the starting point for Catalyst's aesthetic was "techno witch", with her final design aiming to represent both stylishness - in her emo goth vibes - and technological practicality. She is, after all, a member of a terraforming crew hired to help restore the moon of Cleo - which, as Season 15 begins, has been turned in an Apex Games arena, something Catalyst won't stand for.


Described as an "elegant and standoffish woman who likes crystals more than she likes people", Catalyst is Apex Legends' first trans character - voiced by trans actor Meli Grant - and, as Respawn succinctly puts it, simply reflects the fact the "real world is a diverse place".

The "New Zealand" trick, which lets players trick their consoles into letting them access a game that doesn't release until midnight in their own region, has been a staple of game releases for many years. 


But Infinity Ward has issued a statement warning players may experience "connectivity issues" and "may be locked out of the game" until the game is officially released in their region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinity Ward has shared a list of changes to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer ahead of tomorrow's release. The changes were made in response to feedback from the beta.


The biggest change is the addition of diamond icons above enemy heads to increase visibility. 


In the beta, there was no indicator to differentiate between friendly and enemy players. This was traditionally achieved through name tags in previous games, but Infinity Ward took the design decision to remove them, seemingly to add to realism. Players didn't take kindly to the change and called for the return of name tags. Diamond icons are therefore a compromise between good enemy visibility and realism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's head of gaming Phil Spencer has discussed possible price increases across the Xbox line, acknowledging that while the company has so far maintained prices for its consoles, Game Pass, and games, it will "at some point...have to raise the price on certain things".


Speaking at the Wall Street Journal's Tech Live (thanks The Verge), Spencer admitted, "We've held price on our console, we've held price on games and our subscription. I don't think we'll be able to do that forever... I do think at some point we'll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices."


Earlier this year, of course, Sony announced it would be increasing the cost of PlayStation 5 in response to "high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends". At the time, Spencer said Xbox would not be following suit, explaining, "When our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don't think it's the right move." Given Spencer's latest comments, though, it's unclear how long that might last.

Prime Video and Kilter Films - the production company behind the TV adaptation, headed by Westworld creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - revealed the image as part of a special birthday tweet, accompanied by the message, "We made something special for the occasion".


It shows a mysterious figure silhouetted in the open entrance to Vault 33, while three other figures - all wearing their regulation blue Vault-Tec jumpsuits - look on from within. Rather ominously, a pair of legs can be seen on the floor in the distance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall, the vampire-hunting co-op shooter from Arkane Austin, is getting into the spirit of the spooky season with a new trailer showcasing the titular town's vampiric denizens.


It's all a lot more atmospheric than previous showings for the game - which have predominantly focused on the camaraderie and quippery of its four playable heroes - and ramps up the spookiness by highlighting the varied vampire opponents waiting to be encountered in Redfall, Massachusetts. One sequence, in which a player prowls a blood-spattered family home by torchlight, suggests Redfall may even have time for a few proper scares among its mayhem.


"From the devious Angler to the ever-vigilant Watcher," teases the blurb accompanying the trailer, "this is just a bite of what you and your squad will face as you fight to take back Redfall."

As detailed in newly updated five-year release roadmap for investors, CI's new live-service game, codenamed Project Scorpio, is being developed by its internal Underdog Studio - which makes the Sniper: Ghost Warrior games - with an anticipated launch of 2024/5. CI says the title will be supported through in-game purchase mechanics, events, and esports post-launch.


In addition to Project Scorpio, Underdog is collaborating with a currently unnamed partner studio to develop the next entry in the Sniper: Ghost Warrior series. Details on this are limited but it's also aiming for a 2024/5 release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With things starting to get a little spooky as Halloween approaches, Origame Digital - the developer behind acclaimed photography adventure Umurangi Generation - has teased a brand-new horror game it's calling FiveSeven.


FiveSeven made a sudden and unexpected appearance (as spotted in this Reddit thread) during a video on obscure horror games by Umuragi Generation composer ThorHighHeels, with the teaser dropped right into the middle of a section on Vampire Rain: Altered Species.


Beginning with a title reading The Last Train out of Narita, the 40 seconds or so of footage - which sports a similar lo-fi aesthetic to Umurangi Generation - focuses on a besuited protagonist, seemingly named Reegan. First we see them exploring a train, initially scurrying beneath its seats, before grabbing a revolver and facing off against a sinister shadow monster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the march toward Apex Legends' 15th season on 1st November continues, developer Respawn Entertainment has shared a first proper look at the free-to-play battle royale game's new semi-terraformed Broken Moon map.


Broken Moon takes players to Cleo, the fractured moon that played a major role in new hero Catalyst's introductory Stories from the Outlands trailer. Years after a meteor impact almost destroyed it, Cleo is now partly terraformed and habitable - but to further fund its colonisation, the government has entered into a contract to hold the Apex Games there.


When players step onto the surface of Broken Moon - said to be of a similar size to Apex Legend's World's Edge map - they'll discover a world of two distinct halves, one part colonised and lush with vegetation, the other still barren.

        <updated>2022-10-24T15:02:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At a launch event in the Stade de France on Thursday, Philips announced a brand new gaming brand, Evnia, with a full lineup of monitors, keyboards, mice and headsets. The name comes from the Greek Εύ and νοια and reportedly translates as 'smart thinking', and plays into an overall wholesome and inclusive vibe with a focus on 'reinventing the rules' of PC peripherals. Ironically, this kind of credo is fairly endemic amongst gaming brands, but Philips has at least made some plays to differentiate themselves, designing products with refreshing off-white/grey colourways, partially built with recycled materials and fronted by Kenyan fighting games pro QueenArrow. 
As well as offering a bit of a different look to your standard black-and-red gaming gear, the keyboards, mice and headsets announced also held up well in the brief testing session we were afforded, particularly the keyboards that offered some interesting features on top of solid fundamentals. These units were still pre-production models, but there's enough of interest here to mention ahead of their planned release date early next year.  
First up, the SPK8708 full-size mechanical keyboard. Like other high-tier Evnia peripherals, the SPK8708 is a fully wireless model that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, with the former offering lower latency and the latter broader compatibility and longer battery life. Like Philips TVs, it comes with Ambilight branded lighting that spills out behind and around the keyboard, complementing the LEDs behind each keycap. A volume wheel in the upper right corner seemed to have an integrated display inside, which could offer some interesting options along the same lines as the DF-favourite SteelSeries Apex Pro - although it didn't seem to be operational in the unit we had access to.

Earlier this month, a number of key members of the development team confirmed they were no longer working at the studio. "The reason for dissolving the cultural organisation is that it no longer represents the ethos it was founded on," wrote founding member of the ZA/UM cultural association Martin Luiga. "People and ideas are meant to be eternal; organisations may well be temporary."


Luiga later alleged that some team members were fired on false premises.

"BUG REPORT: I was playing a game and I noticed that the enemy Lucio was visible through the walls," they wrote in a post that has received two thousand upvotes. "He used the Snow Fox skin and the weapon has smoke coming from it and it seems to be visible through the walls. Don't use this skin because it gives you a positional disadvantage at all times."

Shortly after the remake was unveiled earlier this week, Blaustein retweeted Konami's announcement, saying: "Cool! And they will, once again, use the SH2 English script that I wrote/translated (oh, directed too) completely by myself and I will get zero compensation for it and there will not be tens of thousands of people on Twitter outraged on my behalf. Maybe I should make a video?" The latter sentence refers to a dispute between Konami and Silent Hill 2's voice artists around the time Silent Hill HD Collection was released back in 2012.

Whilst hardly a cast-iron guarantee, it should be welcome news for Resident Evil fans, particularly as Code Veronica was a critical darling at the time and is still considered by some to be the "real" sequel to Resident Evil 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toukana Interactive's sublime landscape-building puzzler Dorfromantik has just been updated on Steam, adding the Japan-inspired Sakura biome, controller support, and more.


Dorfromantik's Sakura biome was previously exclusive to the recently released Switch version of the game, and today's PC update - appropriately known as the Sakura Update - brings over a number of other features formerly only available on Nintendo's platform.


Steam players can now, for instance, enjoy full controller support - which, among other things, helps massively improve what was previously a slightly fiddly experience on Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Tomb Raider animation canonically explains how Lara Croft survived the events between Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and those of the series' sixth instalment, Angel of Darkness. 


 The Myth of El Hawa is written by Angel of Darkness scribe Murti Schofield, directed by veteran Tomb Raider fan Ash Kaprielov, and stars voice actress Jonell Elliott (who voiced Lara in several Tomb Raider games including Angel of Darkness and The Last Revelation). 


As for The Myth of El Hawa itself, this is told through Lara's diary entries. These reveal how, following her fall into the collapsing temple of Horus at The Last Revelation's close, Lara struggled to make her way out alive. However, make her way out she did, and on the brink of death she was found by a shaman named Putai.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is streamlining Discord server voice chat support on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S by ditching the feature's convoluted mobile app requirement - a change currently going through Insider testing ahead of its public release.


Discord server voice chat support launched for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in September, making it possible for users to talk with their friends directly through Discord Voice chats, wherever they may be. Unfortunately, it's a pretty fiddly process in its current guise.


Users first need to link their Xbox and Discord accounts then download the Xbox mobile app to their phone - which must also be linked to a user's console. Discord is then launched on mobile or desktop, and once a user has joined the Voice call they want to transfer to Xbox, they need to select the 'transfer call' option. Next, hit the 'confirm' button back in the mobile app, at which point it's time to don a headset and start chatting via console.

Wright discussed the project with Axios alongside collaborator Lauren Elliot, the co-creator of Carmen Sandiego. Together, the pair have a blockchain-focused startup working on the game alongside engine maker Unity and NFT game platform Gala Games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night brought us our best look yet at Capcom's ambitious Resident Evil 4 remake, which Eurogamer's editor-in-chief Martin has now got hands-on time with.


In a separate round of interviews, Capcom staff have been discussing the project further - including the original's slightly contentious inclusion of button-mashing quick-time events (QTEs).


The good news here is the Resi 4 remake will tone these down - and in-game cut-scenes will no longer force you to quickly pick up the controller and spam a button to avoid death.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has given perhaps the best look yet at its highly anticipated Resident Evil 4 remake - and shared a little more on its various other Resident Evil projects - in its latest video showcase, with the remake getting both new gameplay footage and a new story trailer.


On the gameplay front, Capcom shared an action-packed couple of minutes of its RE4 remake, starting with a sequence from early in the game that sees protagonist Leon skulking through the woods before stumbling across a seemingly abandoned barn. It's a suitably atmospheric sequence, showing off the remake's various visual upgrades, and one that segues into a chaotic outdoor battle as Leon is swarmed by Ganado. Inevitably, things come to an end with our old friend chainsaw guy - but Leon somehow manages to keep his head on this time around.


Following its latest gameplay reveal, Capcom discussed the remake in a little more detail, explaining its goal is to "[pay] respect to original game's world while implementing new ideas and state of the art graphics to strengthen the core concepts of the title". This, it say, "will provide a fresh experience with a sense of familiarity if you played the original, that both newcomers and veterans to Resident Evil 4 will enjoy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends' 15th season, Eclipse, is right around the corner, and the usual promotional blitz is has begun ahead of its 1st November arrival - this time bringing a new cinematic trailer giving a first look at recently revealed new hero Catalyst's goopy abilities.


Catalyst - an "experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer", and the first trans Legend to join the Apex Legends' line-up - made her introductions earlier this week in a new animated episode of Stories from the Outlands. Here, we got a glimpse of her early years on the planet of Boreas - as she becomes unwittingly embroiled in an eco-terrorist plot to save Boreas' moon - but developer Respawn's latest trailer skips ahead to Catalyst's Apex Games debut.


There's a lot for eagle-eyed Apex Legends fans to unpack in the new cinematic trailer - including a fair glimpse at what is almost certainly Season 15's previously teased new moon map - but the focus is very much on Catalyst and her new abilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia - the striking new survival horror from acclaimed studio Santa Ragione - is free on the Epic Games Store next week, alongside Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.


Santa Ragione, if you're unfamiliar, previously released the celebrated likes of MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, but Saturnalia - which is heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - looks to be its most ambitious title yet, trapping players in an ancient village steeped in murky rituals and challenging them to uncover its many secrets.


Although a solo experience, players take control of four different characters as they investigate the village's labyrinthine, and decidedly psychedelic, streets. If one character get captured - horrible things lurk in the shadows - players can switch to another and attempt a rescue, but once all four are dead, the village physically reconfigures itself for another attempt. Thankfully, narrative and puzzle progress is retained across game-overs.

This is the next in the CMA's ongoing investigation into the acquisition, which entered Phase 2 at the start of September when the regulator decided the deal required more in-depth scrutiny.


Last week, as part of Phase 2, the CMA released its Issues Statement, detailing the focus of the inquiry's second stage and setting out the potential areas of concern - known as "theories of harm" - it's investigating. These relate to the acquisition's impact on multi-game subscription services, the future of cloud gaming, and the availability of Activision content on rival platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're chewing over last night's Silent Hill: Transmission broadcast, and Konami's big plans to relaunch its survival horror brand.

Silent Hill has lain dormant ever since Konami cancelled Silent Hills and unreleased Hideo Kojima's PT demo. The question is, will anything announced last night live up to that? There was plenty on offer - a remake, a new game, several spin-offs and a movie - from an array of developers. Still, it often felt like we were seeing little in the way of concrete details - release dates and actual gameplay footage.

Will Konami's sudden onslaught of Silent Hill bring about a fresh start for the series? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

This new Marathon project will take the form of a three-person squad-based extraction shooter, Insider-gaming reports, and is currently in a pre-alpha state.

Update 2.2 reworks Orbital in a similar manner to how September's patch reworked the (appropriately named) Renewal. Here, Battlefield developer DICE says it has "improved gameplay flow" and added more cover and assets, as well as various terrain improvements.


Another big addition to this update is that of persistent servers for Battlefield Portal, so your server will always remain available within the game's server browser - even when there are no active players.

Carter did not elaborate on what the Fallout London team was going to change this all to, instead saying fans would have to hold tight and be patient on this front. He was quite adamant, however, the team would not bring  back its ghoulish Royal Family members in the future.

In an interview with Famitsu (reported by PushSquare), Honma stated that a second season was not in the works.



"I personally would like to continue to work with Japanese studios to produce more anime in the future, partly because we have received very good feedback. However, just to be clear, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was planned as a standalone work, so there's no such thing as 'we are actually working on Season 2 in the background'," he said.

This free update will add the long-awaited campaign network co-op mode, as well as the official launch of the game's Forge beta (in case you missed it, some have already got their hands on it and have been creating some truly impressive reimaginings of games such as Ocarina of Time and PT within). 


In the campaign's upcoming co-op mode, you will be able to have a whirl around Halo Infinite's story with up to three other fellow Spartans. This will also be supported with the Mission Replay feature (finally), and 343 has revealed there will now be another 24 achievements to unlock in the game. As a reminder, this is not the local split-screen co-op, which the developer previously announced it had cancelled altogether.

Development duties are being handled by Neobards Entertainment, which has previously worked with Capcom as a support studio on several its Resident Evil games including Re:Verse.

First up, we got a debut trailer for Bloober Team's much-rumoured Silent Hill 2 remake, which is set for PC via Steam and PlayStation 5. It's listed as a PlayStation console exclusive for 12 months, which suggests it will hit Xbox a year after launch.


Next came the reveal of Silent Hill Townfall, developed by Stories Untold and Observation maker No Code alongside Annapurna Interactive. This one remains something of a mystery. Expect more in the new year.

Return to Silent Hill is the movie project we've heard whispers of previously from the original film's director Christophe Gans. Tonight, Konami assistant producer Rui Naito confirmed this big screen follow-up was very much a thing that was happening - and indeed that it has actually been the "catalyst" for the new wave of Silent Hill games coming to fruition.

Bloober Team - the studio behind the likes of The Medium, Layers of Fear, and Observer - has been rumoured to be involved in a Silent Hill revival as far back as June last year, when it announced a partnership with Konami to create a new game. Rumours that the project would be a Silent Hill 2 remake began to coalesce following a series of leaks earlier this year.


Now, though, Konami and Bloober Team have made things official, revealing the remake during a busy Silent-Hill-focused livestream in a two-and-a-half minute trailer. Here, we were shown some iconic Silent Hill 2 moments given a new-gen visual overhaul - extending to a slightly dubious makeover for protagonist James Sunderland, who now looks a little like Alan Wake's unpopular brother.

Not much has been revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie. "Why are you here?" he asks. "Here to be punished... That's good I like it. I think we've done something so awful that we are stuck here in this place being judged by these... people," he continues. 

The trailer ends with some frames of a man wearing glasses, before cutting to the logo of the game.

So, what do we expect? The rumour mill has certainly been churning, and it seems likely we'll see Konami pull back the curtain on a number of Silent Hill projects set to bring back the survival horror franchise in a big way. There's been word of a Silent Hill remake alongside all-new titles, and even a new Silent Hill movie.
How many games are we getting? Has Sony snaffled them all under some kind of timed exclusivity? Are they actuall all for mobile? We'll find out in just a couple of hours.

The detail comes from Xbox's full response to last week's filing by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, in which the regulator raised its current concerns regarding Microsoft's ongoing $68bn takeover attempt of Activision Blizzard.

Sony's existing marketing deal with Call of Duty sees the PlayStation branding used in conjunction with advertising, while players on Sony platforms get early access to in-game content.

The Crysis Remastered Trilogy, if this all seems a little like déjà vu, first released for PlayStation, Switch, and PC last October, but the PC version was limited to the Epic Games Store - despite the remaster of the original Crysis already having been launched on Steam.


Come November, though, Steam players will also have the opportunity to check out Crytek's remasters of Crysis 2 and 3, with all three games bundled into one package featuring various tweaks and enhancements for their respective single-player campaigns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard's Albany-based band of Diablo testers have won the right to form a union.


Their petition to the US National Labor Relations Board has now been accepted, setting the stage for a vote by employees to formalise the process. Ballots will be sent out as soon as next week, Kotaku reported, with a result due on 18th November.


Activision Blizzard had previously argued against this process going ahead, and claimed it should be a decision made by a larger group of employees at the Albany studio rather than its testing team. Ultimately, the NLRB disagreed.

In addition to these specs, Infinity Ward has also announced those who pre-ordered the game digitally will be able to get their preloads on the go from today (19th October). This will in turn offer up those eight days of early campaign access announced in August, which will go live tomorrow.


Meanwhile, preloading for the full release (which, unlike the early access mentioned above, will include the multiplayer and Special Ops elements) can begin from the 26th October ahead of the game's official launch on the 27th/28th, depending on where you are playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Netflix's gaming strategy grows ever bolder following its first tentative steps into the market, the streaming service has now revealed it's "seriously exploring" its own cloud gaming offering.


That's according to Netflix's vice president of gaming Mike Verdu, who, speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt (thanks TechCrunch), explained the company saw the technology as "a value add" for subscribers. "We're not asking you to subscribe as a console replacement. It's a completely different business model. The hope is over time that it just becomes this very natural way to play games where wherever you are."


Addressing the elephant in the room - the dramatic failure of Google's game streaming service Stadia, which will cease operations in January, a little over three years after its initial launch - Verdu noted that while Stadia was a "technical success" and was "fun to play games on", "it had some issues with the business model."

Taylor - who has been replaced by voice actor Jennifer Hale for Bayonetta 3 - made the claim in a series of emotional videos shared on Twitter this weekend, citing Platinum's "insulting [pay] offer" as the reason for her absence in the third game.


"I didn't want the world, I didn't ask for too much," she said in one video. "I was just asking for a decent, dignified living wage. What they did was legal, but it was immoral." Taylor also called for a boycott of Bayonetta 3, suggesting fans instead donated their money to charity.

It's said to be built on a foundation of "charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories" that will stay true to previous Sims games while also "pushing to evolve how those Sims think and behave, [pushing] tools even further when creating and customising, and [exploring] innovative ways to not only tell stories but to collaborate on those stories or creations with your closest friends across your favourite devices."

What that actually means in practice isn't immediately clear from the trailer's rapid cuts and overbearing stylings, but EA sheds more light on the matter in an accompanying press release.


"In Need for Speed Unbound," it explains, "players have to take risks to get to the top. Choose how and when to put it all on the line, pulling huge drifts on the street, outdriving the cops, or placing side bets with their own earnings against rival racers."

As PCGamesN spotted, one of these traits is called "Hero Worshipped" in which the player has "earned the attention of an annoying 'Adoring Fan' who will show up randomly and jabber at you incessantly. On the plus side, he'll give you gifts..."  See for yourself in the below video at the 3:17 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has updated its Online Service Shutdown page, detailing several of its titles losing online features in the near future. 


On 9th November, both Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars for Xbox 360 (including its Kane's Wrath expansion) will see their online services shut  down. 
Red Alert 3, as I am sure you are all aware, is most famous for Tim Curry's exuberant proclamation that he's headed to space as it is the one place not corrupted by capitalism. That's always a fun clip to replay.

It's announced it'll be hosting a live concert this December that, for those in the US willing to pay for it, will be streamed online.


Elden Ring: A Night in the Lands Between, as the event will be known, is a collaboration between Bandai Namco, award-winning musician Kenny Garrett, and Takuya Kuroda. It promises "recognisable melodies from the game's soundtrack... performed live in Jazz format - with improvisation" by a group of musicians lead by Garrett on alto sax and Kuroda on trumpet.


"While video game soundtracks have seen variations as symphonic music and even Rock n' Roll, our 'A Night in the Lands Between' Jazz event is exploring a wonderfully different treatment of the Elden Ring soundtrack", wrote Bandai Namco's senior director of esports and live entertainment Wataru Nakasuji in a statement accompanying today's announcement.

Switch Sports' servers were taking offline and save data backups were suspended on Friday, while Nintendo investigated a significant bug introduced in last week's 1.2.1 update that caused crashes on the game's pre-match loading screen, during both online and offline play.


Servers and save data backup functionality have remained unavailable since then, but Nintendo Japan has now offered an update on its website (thanks VGC), confirming the crashing was caused by a save writing error under certain conditions and revealing it'll be restoring all functionality across two waves later this week.

Back in August, Coffee Talk developer Toge Productions accused publisher PQube of misusing money gained from a diversity fund. Toge claimed this money was intended to finance its next game A Space For The Unbound.



"The diversity fund was a grant fund intended to help underrepresented game developers, especially during the pandemic," Toge Productions wrote at the time. "However, instead of giving those funds to the developers as the grant was intended, PQube Games intentionally withheld information about the grant and used it as a leverage for their own commercial gain.

Beyond being a test for players with a buffed-up Pokémon team, Elite Raids also seem like Pokémon Go developer Niantic's latest nudge to get users back outside in big numbers, generating the kind of crowds you might see playing pre-pandemic.


The first evidence of Elite Raids began popping up in-game on Friday, with an extended 24-hour countdown clock on some Pokémon gyms and a flashy new raid egg on the game's map. A message stated these raids would require players to take part in-person at the raid site itself, rather than using a Remote Raid Pass to join from the sofa.

For now, Minecraft's 2023 update is being referred to as "Minecraft 1.20", and is confirmed to feature camels, hanging signs, chiseled bookshelves and bamboo crafting - including the ability to build a bamboo raft. Camels look a particularly interesting addition - as they can jump fair distances and fit two players riding on top.

This news was confirmed by Gotham Knights' executive producer Fleur Marty via Discord. Here, Marty explained this was "due to the types of features" included in the game, adding the additional option of a performance mode would not have been "as straightforward as lowering the resolution and getting a higher FPS".


Marty highlighted the game's "highly detailed" open-world setting and its untethered co-op gameplay as two of the reasons the upcoming game does not "have a performance/quality toggle option". She concluded by confirming Gotham Knights will run at 30FPS on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 (the developer previously confirmed it had canned the planned PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game).

"As a longtime member of the voice acting community," Hale wrote on Twitter, "I support every actor's right to be paid well and have advocated consistently for this for years.

This latest journey to the realms of spookidom is the third Halloween event for Dreams, following previous outings that saw Media Molecule collaborating with its community to create explorable haunted houses and then, last year, a creepy old fairground.


Things are getting a little more fantastical this time around, however, with a quest to the far-flung Land of Lost Dreams, where players can embark on a quest full of odd characters and puzzles as they attempt to uncover a "rich and unnerving history".

Switch Sports' version 1.2.1 update launched earlier this week, aiming to further strengthen measures against what Nintendo called "disruptive behaviours" online, as well as pledging to suspend any online players violating its Community Guidelines. Punishable actions included "fraudulent behaviour such as save data manipulation."


Unfortunately, patch 1.2.1 also introduced a significant bug causing crashes - whether playing online or offline - during the pre-match loading screen.

Finding The Flowzone, as the new expansion is known, takes OlliOlli World's acclaimed skating action high above Radlandia, with players roaming the clouds in a fantastical floating boat alongside the infamous Radmospheric Three - "grizzled sea-dog Captain Squid, the prim and proper Professor Planks, and the mystically inclined Christopher Licht". 


Ultimately, the goal is to reach the fabled city of Radlantis, meet the legendary Gail Force, and compete before the Skate Godz to earn the Radlantis Rivals Cup. First, though, players must complete courses set among the clouds, with some familiar Radlandia sights providing the backdrop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it's not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we're pressing the 'unlaunch' button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th," says Nvidia, in a remarkable new blog post that effectively calls a halt to the upcoming launch of its most contentious of RTX 4000 releases, hinting that it'll be renamed when it does eventually re-emerge. RTX 4070 Ti anyone?
Unveiled by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on September 20th, the RTX 4000 line of graphics hardware is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, fabricated on TSMC's 4nm process. The flagship GPU - the GeForce RTX 4090 - released a couple of days ago and was lauded for its massive generational leap over the existing RTX 3000 flagships, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. However, it's fair to say that the same level of acclaim and anticipation was not bestowed upon the RTX 4080, announced in two very different flavours.
The table below reveals that the spec differential wasn't just about the amount of onboard VRAM: each RTX 4080 model was based on an entirely different core processor, with wild variations in the amount of CUDA codes (compute power) and memory bandwidth. In effect, two very different graphics cards were being sold under the same name at very different price-points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Motive has been uncommonly talkative throughout the development of its Dead Space remake, with the studio hosting various livestreams to show off the likes of its improved art, audio, and gameplay changes - but now, with the game's 27th January launch inching ever nearer, we've had our clearest look yet at how all those elements will come together, courtesy of a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough.


Hot on the heels of last week's 2-minute gameplay trailer, EA celebrated Dead Space's 14th anniversary today with an extended sequence from the remake's third chapter, in which protagonist Isaac must explore the infested USG Ishimura in order to reach the ship's engineering deck take and repair its engines.


The sequence began in Ishimura's hanger - an area that's now much bigger than it was in the original (a side-by-side comparison made the differences abundantly clear) - with players now able to zero-g their way around the area. Some of remake's environmental changes have been made to enhance the atmosphere, while other were required to accommodate the fact the Ishimura is now one seamless, interconnected ship, with players no longer needed to rely on the tram to get around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go's annual Halloween event is often one of its best activities and, as expected, this year features a number of new bits and pieces in-game. The event's first half, running from October 20th to 27th, features the arrival of Mega Banette in Mega Raids for the first time, plus the Shiny versions of Noibat and Galarian Yamask. But it also offers some more surprising additions. 


 These include the decision by developer Niantic to sell not one but two cheap event tickets featuring time-limited quests and rewards, with both a $1 and $5 option available. From the sounds of things, these will each offer different rewards, with the former offering encounters with Yamask, while the pricier option gets you an admittedly very cool animated Halloween lantern avatar item/pose.


Niantic is obviously trying something new here with a pair of different ticket options for the same overall event, as well as the fact these rewards will be time-limited - even if you paid. Typically, event questlines from Special Research remain in-game permanently, allowing you to complete them at your leisure.

Some of my earliest memories from Destiny 1 are of looping the Cosmodrome for Spinmetal Leaves, hopping off my Sparrow to gather them, then heading off to the next node. Levelling your gear - which in turn levels your character - required plugging bits of these resources in, and I don't want to think about the number of hours I spent grinding these out.


Now, or rather as of Destiny 2's upcoming Season 19, the materials themselves will no longer be available to acquire - although you can still go zooming around on your Sparrow if you want to.

We were given the following clues: appearance-wise it's squishy, sluggish with an easygoing vibe, and has "two big ol' bumps on its noggin that people always mistake for eyes". And it's "so cute", according to Iono.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Call of Duty players on PC will still need to verify their identity via an SMS message - even though Activision's other half Blizzard rolled back the unpopular requirement for Overwatch 2 following its beleaguered launch.


In a new blog post, Activision confirmed it would require a text-enabled mobile phone number to play the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on PC, and also Warzone 2.0.


This will not apply on console, however, or to anyone on PC who verified their account to play the existing Warzone previously.

ORIGINAL STORY 11.45am UK:
Silent Hill is an unsettling series across the board, there's no denying that - and the silhouette of its fan-favourite Pyramid Head is enough to induce nightmares. 


Now we know more about how this monstrous humanoid came to be, at least in terms of his conception - and it turns out he was inspired by background characters from the 1995 film Braveheart.

Digital copies of the game will unlock at midnight local time next Tuesday, 18th October, but it appears some early physical copies have been sent out early. Eurogamer has spotted some big spoilers doing the rounds - so be careful where you click if you want to go in blind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're back discussing Microsoft's big Activision Blizzard deal and the latest developments in the ongoing saga of the $68bn buyout being finalised.

Yesterday, Microsoft leapt upon the latest concerned update from the UK's deal regulator and repeatedly tried to minimise its own importance in the video games market. Microsoft stated it was far from the leader in terms of console share and PC games sold, and lacked any real presence on mobile devices. In a particularly eye-opening claim, Microsoft even said PlayStation's userbase would be "significantly larger" than Xbox even if every COD player ditched Sony. At the same time, Microsoft also criticised the regulator for appearing to take Sony's own complaints about the deal at face value. 

Is this fighting talk from Microsoft, or squeaky bum time in Redmond over real concerns the UK will block the deal outright? Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan share their thoughts on whether the deal will go through, what changes  Microsoft could make to get it over the finish line, and whether it should go ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Trek: Resurgence, the new narrative adventure from developer Dramatic Labs, will no longer release this year as originally planned and is now expected to arrive on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation in April 2023.


Resurgence, which was announced at last year's Game Awards, takes place after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, telling its story from the alternating perspectives of two different characters - First Officer Jara Rydek and Engineering Crewperson Carter Diaz - with gameplay said to consist of playable cinematic sequences.


Everything shown so far points to an experience very much in the same vein as the interactive narrative adventures pioneered by Telltale Games - which isn't particularly surprising given that Dramatic Labs was founded by controversial former Telltale Games boss Kevin Bruner, and includes around 20 former Telltale employees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you can somehow still look at your gaming backlog without being consumed by existential dread, here's another two additions for your infinitely expanding pile: Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition and Evoland Legendary Edition, both free next week on the Epic Games Store.


Fallout 3 likely needs no introduction, given its lofty place in the gaming pantheon. Released back in 2008, it was Bethesda's first foray into the Fallout universe (1 and 2 were the work of Black Isle Studios), expanding on the open-world RPG freedom of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion to deliver a sprawling, dizzyingly rich post-apocalyptic jaunt through The Capital Wasteland.


An "embarrassment of riches" is what Eurogamer called Fallout 3 in 2008, describing it as a "thrilling, all-consuming experience that will absorb you for weeks... as you fall in love with the relentless excitement, incredible atmosphere, sense of place and sheer choice." The Game of the Year Edition being given away on Epic includes the base game and all its DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Insomniac Games' formerly PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be coming to PC on 18th November - and ahead of its release, Sony has detailed the PC port's system-specific features and requirements.


In case it somehow wasn't immediately obvious, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the Miles-Morales-starring follow-up to Insomniac's original Marvel's Spider-Man, taking the first game's acclaimed web-swinging open-world action and infusing it with a new hero and a bit of snowy, seasonal jollity thanks to its year-end setting.


"Insomniac's second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original," said Eurogamer's Martin Robinson in his Recommended review, "but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It's a game that's full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The growing popularity of digital purchases has had the unintended effect of breaking down regional pricing barriers designed to keep games affordable all over the world. 


This is due to "region-hopping" - a tactic used by those seeking to take advantage of lower prices in other countries, as publishers adjust the price of games in each region based on median incomes. 


The trouble with this is it means customers from richer economies can also loophole themselves into grabbing a game for significantly cheaper than their own local pricing.

The duo can regularily be seen getting into all sorts of exploits that often result in them losing girls, getting wedgies and a myriad of other such fiascos. Remember that time Bart sold his soul to Milhouse? That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. 
However, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as "The Springfield Files."

This episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer's conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out. But that is not what we are here to talk about. Rather, I want to remind you all of the arcade game Milhouse plays in this episode - Kevin Costner's Waterworld.

The Rock, of course, already exists in Fortnite as one of the game's original characters - The Foundation - and has leant his role and likeness to the hero since March last year. 


Now he'll appear in character as Black Adam, to tie in with his appearance in the film of the same name, which is set to launch in cinemas next week.

Now, in light of this news, the developer behind top-down party battle game and Google Stadia exclusive Outcasters has informed its players that, at this point in time, it "does not have plans to bring [the game] to other platforms".


In a statement on Twitter, British developer Splash Damage explained that as Outcasters was both designed and built with Stadia specifically in mind, the game's systems were "heavily reliant on the platform" and the work required to release it on a different platform was simply too complex at this time.

Since launch, the console has been hampered with stock shortage issues and remains in high demand. That's despite a price increase for UK consumers of £30 back in August, which Sony blamed on inflation.

FIFA 23 is, of course, also the last EA Sports FIFA franchise release in history - with the series set to transition to EA Sports FC from next year. 


Signs were good that FIFA 23 had performed well at launch this year. Launched on 30th September, the game's first week of UK boxed game sales slightly beat those of FIFA 22 - despite the overall trend of declining physical game sales in favour of digital.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Starfield's hugely anticipated 2023 release growing ever-closer, Bethesda has launched a new Q&A video series, and episode one sees director Todd Howard responding to a number of community queries - including sharing some thoughts on traits, dialogue, and whether Starfield can be described as a "hard sci-fi" game.


Howard began the chat by detailing a few of Starfield's inspirations - 1984 space sim SunDog: Frozen Legacy and pen-and-paper RPG Traveller, if you're wondering - before moving on to tackle the "hard sci-fi" question. This, he said, was a little tricky to answer insofar as different people will likely have different definitions of "hard sci-fi", but for Bethesda, "It is more hard to us, where you can draw that line from, okay, here's how man explored space, and [then] look at our ships and say, alright that has some visual identity back to that".


However, he also called the question a bit of a trap, "because it's a video game. Like, a hard science-fiction video game would be, you die in space cold."

The original version of Valve's Steam mobile app launched over a decade ago, and it's felt exceedingly outdated for a very long time. As of today, though, iOS and Android users can download a completely refreshed version via their device's respective app stores.


It's most immediately obvious change is a considerably more streamlined interface - which gives quick access to the store, personalised news, Steam Guard, and notifications, as well as unburying the likes of wish lists and other key features - but there's plenty more besides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Torchlight: Infinite - a new free-to-play reimagining of the dungeon-crawling action-RPG series - has just launched its open beta on Android, iOS, and PC.


Torchlight, if you're unfamiliar, was originally the work of now-defunct developer Runic Games, which made two games in the series before its closure in 2017 - the sequel delivering a critically acclaimed chunk of captivating dungeon-crawling and class-based hack-and-slash action. 


Having disbanded Runic, publisher Perfect World then revived the series just nine months later, handing the reins to developer Echtra Games for 2020's Torchlight 3. Interestingly, this third outing was initially planned to be a free-to-play title before Perfect World eventually capitulated after a bit of an outcry - but now, following Torchlight 3's less-than-stellar reception, those free-to-play plans are back for Torchlight: Infinite.

Following the termination of FIFA's partnership with EA earlier this year - which will result in the latter's long-running football series being rebranded as EA Sports FC from 2023 - FIFA president Gianni Infantino insisted, "I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans."


To that end, it said it had already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024, but would first be launching a number of "non-simulation games" toward the end of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have used thermal cameras and ML guessing techniques to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3563693">recover passwords</a> from measuring the residual heat left by fingers on keyboards. From the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Early backdoor attacks against machine learning set off an arms race in attack and defence development. Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Basically, real programmers are having their resumes copied and co-opted by scammers, who apply for jobs (or, I suppose, get recruited from various job sites), then hire other people with Western looks and language skills are  to impersonate those first people on Zoom job interviews. Presumably, sometimes the scammers get hired and&#8230;I suppose&#8230;collect paychecks for a while until they get found out and fired. But that requires a bunch of banking fraud as well, so I don&#8217;t know...</p>]]></summary>
