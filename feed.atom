British developer Double Eleven and publisher Paradox Interactive made the announcement today, and confirmed a £35 pricetag ($40/€40). 


As you can see from the reveal trailer below, Prison Architect 2 (as it's unsurprisingly titled) has been rebuilt from the ground up as a 3D experience, unlocking the ability to build across multiple floors in a sandboxy environment with ease.

Speaking with VGC, Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani said the team had "dabbled" with AI program Midjourney - a known AI tool that converts text into art - but the majority of the game has been crafted by hand.


"All of the core elements in Foamstars - the core gameplay, and the things that make the game enjoyable - those are all made by hand," Okatani said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has revealed a release date for the survival horror sequel of 5th September, 2024.
This marks a further delay to the game, which was intially meant to release in April 2022. Since then, the game has been delayed several times for polishing and due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Most recently, Stalker 2 was rumoured to be releasing in December 2023 before GSC Game World pencilled in a launch window of Q1 2024.
"While there is absolutely no way to make another delay sound less dim," GSC Game World said in a press statement, "we decided to be clear about our reasons to postpone the game for the sake of yet another wave of polishing." GSC stated the game contained "certain technical imperfections" at the beginning of the year, making it clear the game "needed more time in the oven".

Sea Peoples factions have access to new mechanics including War Spoils, in which you can raze settlements to raise resources, and will benefit from the Crisis and Collapse world states which put other factions at a disadvantage.

Notable additions with this wave include Persona 3 Reload and Palworld (aka Pokémon with guns, see picture above). Persona 3 Reload (Cloud, Console, and PC) will arrive early next month, on 2nd February. 


"I can say that Persona 3 Reload's promise is undeniable," wrote Henry Stockdale in Eurogamer's preview of the game. "Remaking an RPG with such a vast legacy would prove daunting for many, yet even with the omissions, Atlus is building on the original game's foundations well. After many years of waiting, I'm excited to dive in properly next month."

Remedy revealed this logo in a blog post back in April last year. "The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old," it wrote at the time. "It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today's Remedy."


The new logo is a stylised R, but as reported by RespawnFirst, this has been opposed by Take-Two as "there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The director of Warner Bros' upcoming Minecraft film adaptation wants to avoid any kind of fan reaction akin to that 'Ugly Sonic' reveal. 


As a reminder, 'Ugly Sonic' was the original design for Sonic from the 2020 film, starring Jim Carrey and James Marsden. On Sonic's initial full reveal in the first trailer, many were left unimpressed (to put it mildly) by the direction the designers had gone. But even before that there was concern, when posters teasing Sonic's cinematic release showed the hedgehog's oddly lithe silhouette and his nightmarish legs.


In fact, the criticism surrounding Sonic's seemingly final look was so loud, the team went back to the drawing board and redesigned the titular blue hedgehog to a less controversial model. If you need a reminder, you can see the Sonic designs in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raven Software was at one time working on a standalone live-service version of Call of Duty's popular Zombies mode, ex-Raven Software lead designer Michael Gummelt has revealed, but it was cancelled after its IP originator - presumably Treyarch - "wanted it back".


That small revelation comes via Gummelt's LinkedIn page (as spotted by MP1ST), which explains he was lead designer on an "ambitious new Call of Duty: Zombies live service project" between 2011 and 2012, but that the whole thing was canceled "when the [Activision] studio that 'owned' that part of the Call of Duty IP wanted it back."


Gummelt doesn't explicitly state the name of the studio, but it seems reasonable to assume he's referring to developer Treyarch, who created the mode for 2008's Call of Duty: World at War.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller caused controversy among players by revealing major gameply changes that'll see tank and damage heroes receive a "modified, tuned-down version of the Support self-healing passive" in Season 9 - and Keller has now admitted it was a "mistake" to make the announcement "out of context".


In his original announcement on the Overwatch blog, Keller explained the changes - part of a wider gameplay overhaul intended to reduce 'frustration' when teams aren't working together - should "give non-Support players more options in terms of sustaining themselves" and "take some of the pressure off Support players to keep everyone alive since individual players now have more control of their own health pool." The idea, he explained, was to shift the balance "between the power of a team and the power of an individual hero or player."


Since that announcement, there've been concerns among the Overwatch community that the changes might fundamental undermine the team-based spirit of Overwatch, while others have worried the shift may risk making Support characters redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Wildcard has announced revised release dates for Ark: Survival Ascended's The Center and Scorched Earth expansion map remasters following a delay for the latter last year, confirming they'll arrival in February and April respectively.


A spruced-up version of Scorched Earth was originally due to launch alongside Ark: Survival Ascended - the controversial full-price remaster of Wildcard's 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved - last year. However, in July, the studio announced that not only was it pushing the launch of the base game back to October, its expansions would be delayed too.


As per its revised plans, Scorched Earth was now targeting a December launch, with Ascended's remastered Ragnarok and Aberration maps due in "Q1 2024". Unfortunately, it became apparent Wildcard's propensity for delays had struck again when a updated roadmap released in December showed Scorched Earth was now due in March 2024, with Aberration aiming for July 2024 and Raganarok not unexpected until September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rebel Wolves - the studio formed by a number of ex-CD Projekt staff, including Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - has confirmed its first project will be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker, after the title was reported online toward the end of last year.


When Rebel Wolves announced its existence in 2022, the studio said its mission was to "evolve the cRPG genre by creating unforgettable stories and stirring deep emotions", confirming its first project would be a then-unnamed "AAA dark fantasy built inside the Unreal 5 engine".


Since then, official word on Rebel Wolves' debut game has been limited, although CEO Tomaszkiewicz - who also served as a secondary director on Cyberpunk 2077 while at CD Projekt - did tease it wouldn't "be as gigantic as The Witcher" but could well have a "greater" number of quests. In the same interview, he also suggested the project would be around the same size as the Witcher 3's Blood and Wine expansion.

The update was shared by Ziostorm on X, after the user noticed Elden Ring's DLC category had been amended on SteamDB. The update in question doesn't have a name, and is merely listed as "SteamDB Unknown App 2778580" for now. However, many have speculated the developer will be making an announcement regarding the expansion's release date in the near future. We will keep you posted. 


Other DLC listed in this section of Elden Ring's Steam page includes the game's digital artbook and soundtrack, as well as its Adventure Guide.

TiavioliGaming on Twitch has already completed all three Dark Souls games using a violin, and is now taking on Elden Ring as his next challenge.

TiavioliGaming caught the eye of the Elden Ring subreddit recently, thanks to a TikTok clip of him defeating Godfrey with his violin - all at a rather calm heart rate of 80bpm.

As is becoming the norm these days, this is your heads up to mute keywords and such on social media, if you want to keep as much of this spruced-up native PS5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 a surprise as possible. 

While the story of The Last of Us Part 2 is already widely known, given it initally released in 2020, several videos making their way around the internet currently include content not in the original, such as the Lost Levels (with potential spoilers), new skins and No Return gameplay.

Speaking on the XboxEra podcast, reliable insider Shpeshal_Nick said the game, codenamed Project Tatanka, had seemingly been cancelled.


While officially unannounced by Microsoft itself, Certain Affinity had discussed the project publicly in broad terms several times, and said in late 2022 that it had been in the works for more than two years, with nearly 100 people then working on it.

However, this news arrived not because T-Pain was announcing his collaboration with Rockstar specifically, but because he was lamenting on an unexpected consequence of his new gig: the fact he can no longer roleplay on NoPixel, a GTA roleplay server.

Last week, James Lambert announced he had taken down the playable build of Portal 64 at Valve's request due to its dependence on "Nintendo's proprietary libraries". 
In an update video uploaded over the weekend, Lambert said he expected Valve would ask him to take Portal 64 down "because it's their IP on a Nintendo console". "Somebody from Valve reached out to me and I was put in contact with their legal team," he revealed.

Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, to give it its full name, is the sequel to Naughty Dog's 85-minute making-of documentary for the original Last of Us, which launched back in 2015 and charted the "dogged development and unique philosophy" of the first game.


Filming of the newly announced follow-up - as per the spoiler-y trailer below - started in 2016 but was abandoned when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020. However, the existing footage has now been revisited and assembled into a making-of documentary that doesn't look like it'll entirely shy away from the more negative aspects of development at Naughty Dog, including crunch - a practice said to be particularly brutal at the studio in a report back in 2020.

Bethesda says it'll share the full update notes when the Steam beta goes live on Wednesday but, ahead of launch, it's teased a number of included improvements in a series of posts on social media. Next week's update will, for instance, introduce improved textures, lighting, and shadows - the accompanying screenshots point to far more natural illumination on character's faces, for instance - as well as additional widescreen support and stability improvements. 


Bethesda is also promising a "multitude of fixes" to quests, remedying the likes of docking and data transfer problems in Eye of the Storm, as well as preventing exploration blockers caused by missing temples in Into the Unknown.

News that development on Missouri is now underway brings the total list of explorable states released or announced for American Truck Simulator since its launch in 2016 all the way up to 16. So far, players can trundle their way across California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma, with Nebraska, Arkansas and Missouri still to come (presumably in that order).


Announcing the Missouri expansion on Steam - which actually happened just before Christmas but I was off and likely in an extended brandy butter stupor at the time, so sorry for the delay - SCS wrote, "Nestled in the heart of the American Midwest, Missouri beckons with a blend of historical significance, natural beauty, and vibrant urban landscapes. Known as the Show-Me State, Missouri invites visitors to explore its diverse offerings."

Yoshida was interviewed by Sony's Shuhei Yoshida on the Game Maker's Notebook podcast (Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences) and candidly discussed development of Final Fantasy 14 and 16, as well as the future of the series.


When jokingly asked if he's directing Final Fantasy 17, Yoshida replied that nothing has been decided yet. "I've had the chance to work on two of these, 14 and 16, so maybe it's time for someone new, instead of having the same old guys handle the next one," he said.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which originally launched last March, serves up a challenging - but surprisingly approachable - action-RPG adventure build around a faster, more aggressive style of combat compared to Team Ninja's previous Nioh games.


"A new setting may suggest a new chapter," Eurogamer contributor Alan Wen wrote in his Recommended review, "but I'd almost prefer to call Wo Long a Nioh-like, or rather the sequel that Nioh 2 should have been, further refining its systems and customisation, cutting back some if not all bloat, and adding an exciting evolution of its foundations that makes its masocore challenge more approachable on its own terms."

Sand Land, for those unaware, is set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply for everyone. Yes, demons and humans. Obviously, something needs to be done about that, and so a rag-tag team sets off in search of the Legendary Spring to bring an end to this thirst.


Sand Land was first announced last year at Summer Games Fest, where we got a look at its arid setting and gorgeous art style. You can see it again now thanks to its new release date trailer, below.

<blockquote><p>Smart Device Manufacturer Liability and Redress for Third-Party Cyberattack Victims</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Smart devices are used to facilitate cyberattacks against both their users and third parties. While users are generally able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and yet un-remediated bug in the smart device&#8217;s code, this lacuna is unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway, which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer of the smart device is proposed...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The DRM was noticed after Steam players began reporting errors when launching Revelations last week, including a reduced and unstable framerate, as well as broken mods.
Steam users review bombed Revelations with complaints about Enigma, which prompted Capcom to roll back the game on 9th January (which can be seen on its history via SteamDB).

Ubisoft has said it plans to add human-recorded dialogue at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that feels a little like being catapulted back in time several decades, Ubisoft has released a free playable Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown demo - for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC - ahead of the game's full launch next week.


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown revives Ubisoft's shamefully long-dormant action-platforming series for a new generation - a new generation that wouldn't even have been born when the last game came out in 2008, thanks to Ubisoft's dallying - this time sending the prince's protector Sargon on a Metroidvania-style quest packed with side-scrolling combat and platform action.


Early word on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - which has been developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the wonderful Rayman Legends and Origins - is reassuringly positive, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman calling it a "supremely polished, ultra smooth game that perfectly leverages every platform it has shipped on."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well here's one way of getting yourself some free publicity: casually announce your product will be releasing alongside Switch 2 this "September" so everyone excitedly thinks you might have just accidentally splurged Nintendo's big secret, then, when you're confronted about it, give a little shrug and admit you were just "guessing".


That's pretty much what happened today when audio company Altec Lansing shared a press release unveiling a partnership with GameShark (now AI Shark) that'll see it release a new AI-powered GameShark successor - an announcement casually tossing in the sentence, "The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024."


Unsurprisingly, Nintendo fans desperate for Switch 2 news following persistent reports the console is launching this year (hello, I am one of these people) immediately began to wonder if Altec Lansing - not a small company by any stretch of the imagination - might have just inadvertently shared some highly confidential information they shouldn't have.

As reported by The Verge, employees at Discord were informed of the job cuts today by CEO Jason Citron in an all-hands meeting and accompanying internal email.


"Today we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to reduce the size of Discord's workforce by 17%," Citron wrote in the email shared by The Verge. "This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one that we have conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our mission over the long term."

However, creator Poncle isn't done yet, and it's now share a revised development roadmap (of sorts) for its perennially vampire-free minimalist survival RPG, which includes an update on cross-saves and a potential online co-op mode.


All this comes in a new goodbye 2023/hello 2024 post shared over on Steam, which begins with a recap of the year just gone and a thanks to players before moving onto matters in Vampires Survivors' near and not-so-near future.


That includes a word on the progress of online co-op support for the game, which Poncle confirmed it was "investigating" back in September last year. A little over three months on and the studio says it's "still investigating" the feature, explaining that to "retro-fit online multiplayer in a game as simple as this, but with so much content, is still a huge challenge."

Created by Retro Games Ltd - the company previously responsible for the C64 Mini and Amiga 500 Mini - the 400 Mini sports a similar design to Atari's 1979 8-bit computer (albeit approximately half the size) but can do a little more beyond its inspiration.


As per Retro Games' announcement, the 400 Mini (styled THE400 Mini) doesn't just emulate the Atari 400 hardware, it's also emulates the entire 8-bit Atari range, including the 400's pricier sibling the Atari 800, plus the XL and XE series, and the 5200 home console.

He said players would be able to make his in-game character "play certain themes" during the then-unannounced remastered's release. 


Now, we have a closer look at just what Santaolalla was talking about, thanks to a new marketing beat for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.


Santaolalla's cameo will actually be part of the game's Guitar Free Play mode. Although, rather than playing the guitar as we have seen Joel doing in promo shots for the upcoming release, he will play the banjo.

It promises a host of improvements across 12 "highly-replayable" missions, including new features such as Instinct Mode, an ever-present minimap, and an array of gameplay improvements inspired by later games in IOI's Hitman series. Of course, outfit changes and using as many different weapons and/or methods as you can is fully encouraged.


Here is a little trailer for it all, showing off some shenanigans across the globe. While I have no interest in becoming an assassin myself, I am rather jealous of Agent 47's travel opportunities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Core Engage and publisher Daedalic Entertainment have shared a gameplay overview of upcoming city builder New Cycle ahead of its release into early access next week.
New Cycle is described as dieselpunk by Core Engage, as the player is tasked with rebuilding society following a "global catastrophe" caused by solar flares. Settlements begin as very basic and players must progress into industrialisation, then capitalism, all whilst tackling the challenges thrown at them by the environment.
The gameplay overview takes us through each of these stages briefly, showing the transformation from a small hunter-gatherer settlement, to a larger industrial town with electricity and factories, before expanding and building a railway to enable trade and tourism.

Pokémon Go Tour: Sinnoh will debut Origin Forme Dialga and Palkia from 2022's Pokémon Legends Arceus - ancient versions of the Legendary creatures from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (the appearance of which is not a surprise, as they were first revealed a little earlier than planned last year). 


Befitting their powerful status and space-time warping properties, the pair will debut a new feature for Pokémon Go named Adventure Effects. These are gameplay-changing abilities unlocked by interacting with the creature itself that can also be boosted further using in-game resources.

The game was announced in September as an 'updated' version of the original Game Boy Advance title. At the time, Nintendo didn't say much else about the re-release, but did say multiplayer will be added.
The new trailer reveals multiplayer will come in the form of local co-op, and it looks like a second player will get to control Toad. Take a look at what's in store for Mario in the trailer below.

Season of Blood - the game's current season - is set to come to a close soon, with the next season then starting up on 23rd January. So, in just under two weeks.


While Blizzard itself has not 'announced' this date at the time of writing, a message has been spotted in Diablo 4 itself proclaiming it to be so. As you can see in the image below, when players boot up the game, they are met with a notice on the character selection screen that reads: "Season 3. Next season begins January 23, 2024".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An unsettling AI-powered hologram of Nintendo mascot Mario at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 event in Las Vegas was unlicensed and unofficial, the company behind the technology has now admitted. 


The odd-looking and robotic-sounding Mario was the work of Proto Hologram, a company that creates holograms held within large box-like structures that you can talk to and interact with. 


More bizarre still, the Mario hologram was supposed to be a collaboration with the AARP, an American advocacy group for people over the age of 50 - apparently to demonstrate how AI holograms could combat loneliness in the elderly. But with Mario? And more to the point - with a poorly-voiced, dead-eyed broken 3D model of Mario?

Now, the internet thinks it has worked out the title of MachineGames' upcoming Indiana Jones game. And it is... Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.


This assumption comes from social media user @Kurakasis, who shared their discovery on X last night. The user revealed that Lucasfilm has been registering a number of domain names that are variations on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle over recent days.

The V2 version of the controller is currently listed on Best Buy Canada at $89.99 and while its features are almost identical to that of the regular DualSense, there are a couple of notable differences. 
The V2 DualSense will have an "exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge" according to the Best Buy listing, and also includes the DualSense charging station (which usually must be bought separately).

That's according to Nikkei Asia (thanks VGC), which reports shares of Nintendo temporarily hit a record 7,902 today on Japan's Nikkei stock index - up 5% from yesterday - pushing its market capitalisation over 10 trillion yen ($69bn) for the first time since November 2007.


The publication notes the reason behind the recent surge in Nintendo's share price is two-fold. Firstly, growth expectations for the company are high in general, thanks to the success of its intellectual property related business, which recently announced a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, alongside the expected launch of Switch 2.

Weird date aside, everything else in the listing looks accurate. Alongside two screenshots featuring the new DLC pack's various building bits in action, we get some blurb explaining the Castle Estate Kit will enable The Sims 4 players to "capture the classic grandeur of a castle".

"While we have been heads down adding cars, tracks, patches, and other improvements," the studio wrote in the first of a series of planned quarterly development updates on its website, "we want to acknowledge the top three areas of feedback we haven't addressed directly".


Those areas, specifically, are driver AI, car progression, and race regulations, and it sounds like fixing AI issues - which, as per Turn 10's update, include "abruptly braking and slowing down; not accelerating out of exits, braking too hard on mild corners, and following racing lines too strictly" - is first on its to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the launch of last year's Forza Motorsport - and an initial flurry of patches and fixes - behind it, developer Turn 10 Studios has confirmed its next steps for the racer will be to address three key community concerns over the "coming months".


"While we have been heads down adding cars, tracks, patches, and other improvements," the studio wrote in the first of a series of planned quarterly development updates on its website, "we want to acknowledge the top three areas of feedback we haven't addressed directly".


Those areas, specifically, are driver AI, car progression, and race regulations, and it sounds like fixing AI issues - which, as per Turn 10's update, include "abruptly braking and slowing down; not accelerating out of exits, braking too hard on mild corners, and following racing lines too strictly" - is first on its to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mojang and developer Blackbird Interactive have officially brought development on Minecraft Legends to a end today with one final content update, wrapping up a little under nine months of post-launch support for the real-time strategy spin-off.


Releasing in May last year, Minecraft Legends unfortunately didn't especially impress, proving to be a decidedly average RTS that failed to do much to justify its use of the Minecraft licence. "It feels too overwhelming and poorly explained for kids," Eurogamer contributor Caelyn Ellis wrote in her review, "too rudimentary for older players and too frustrating for both. Minecraft is, at least for me, about creativity and experimentation, but there's no room for that here."


Still, Mojang and Blackbird Interactive have continued to support Minecraft Legends with a series of post-launch content updates since its arrival, but Mojang has now confirmed today's Snow vs. Snouts update - initially announced during last year's Minecraft Live event and originally planned to launch in December - will be its last.

From 16th January, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands will be available for both PS4 and PS5 (the PS4 version is also streamable), giving PlayStation Plus subscribers the chance to sample Gearbox's well-received tabletop RPG spin on its raucous shooter series. As for Capcom's Resident Evil 2 remake, also available for both PS4 and PS5, it gives the 1998 classic a thorough modernising with splashy new presentation and ample mechanical tweaks, and the results are sublime.


Elsewhere, there's an opportunity to revisit the PS4 version of the utterly wonderful LEGO City Undercover, developer TT Fusion's wildy imaginative and genuinely hilarious open-world take on the familiar Lego game formula, which plays out very much like a family friendly GTA.

Michelle, a woman of Chinese and Native American descent, appeared in the first Tekken game. Michelle was included in the next games until Tekken 3, which introduced her adoptive daughter Julia. Since then, Julia has appeared in the main series instead, with both making appearances in various Tekken spin-offs. 
Since their first appearances, Michelle and Julia have frequently been brought up in discussions of Indigenous representation in video games. Harada took to X (née Twitter) last week to acknowledge the characters' importance within the topic, explain the history of their designs, and ask for the opinions of Native American Tekken fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 to get us up to speed on what has happened in the series so far. It is a fairly standard marketing beat, with others such as Insomniac and Nintendo doing the same thing for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom respectively. But what Insomniac and Nintendo didn't have (or who they didn't have) was Succession's Brian Cox to talk us through the story so far. 


Yes, the man that brought Logan Roy to life is here to tell us all about the Devil gene and more. "Every single fight, no matter how big or small, has a story behind it," the Scottish actor states as dramatic music starts to pound in the background. "There's one hell of a story to tell."


We then get told more about that aforementioned Devil gene, some cliff chucking exploits and the Tekken series' patricidal puzzle. You can have a watch for yourself below. I don't think it is meant to be funny, but it has made me chuckle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 to get us up to speed on what has happened in the series so far. It is a fairly standard marketing beat, with others such as Insomniac and Nintendo doing the same thing for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom respectively. But what Insomniac and Nintendo didn't have (or who they didn't have) was Succession's Brian Cox to talk us through the story so far. 


Yes, the man that brought Logan Roy to life is here to tell us all about the Devil gene and more. "Every single fight, no matter how big or small, has a story behind it," the Scottish actor states as dramatic music starts to pound in the background. "There's one hell of a story to tell."


We then get told more about that aforementioned Devil gene, some cliff chucking exploits and the Tekken series' patricidal puzzle. You can have a watch for yourself below. I don't think it is meant to be funny, but it has made me chuckle.

The faceplates, shown in the header image above and below (thanks, The Verge), are from the Deep Earth Collection and consist of Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue and Sterling Silver. This collection, you may recall, was also announced for the original PS5 model back in September last year. 

"While crafting this new collection of DualSense controller and PS5 console cover colours, we drew inspiration from the beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth. We elevated the colours by adding a metallic finish for a touch of sophistication," designer Satoshi Aoyagi said at the time.

The news was shared in a new blog post from CEO Dan Clancy, including a copy of the internal email sent to staff. "We greatly value the employees we're saying goodbye to today as people and professionals and are grateful for all their efforts to support all of you," he wrote in the post. "Please know that Twitch remains focused on serving our streamers and ensuring that this is the best place to livestream for many years to come."
The included email confirms just over 500 people will lose their jobs. "This will be a very hard day. Our service exists to empower communities to create, together, and every single one of you has played a vital role in fostering our community and furthering that mission," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a day after Unity announced it would be laying off 1,800 employees as part of an ongoing "company reset", it's being reported that live-streaming site Twitch is now poised to cut 35 percent of its workforce - equalling around 500 jobs - later this week.


That's according to Bloomberg's Cecilia D'Anastasio, who, citing "people familiar with the plans", reports the cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday.


While Twitch declined to comment on the story when approached by Bloomberg, the publication claims the job cuts come amid continuing struggles for the live-streaming site. According to Bloomberg's sources, Twitch still remains unprofitable nine years after Amazon acquired the company for $970m.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld, the open-world survival and crafting adventure from developer Pocketpair that looks a lot like Pokémon with guns, is launching into early access on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass next Friday, 19th January.


Pocketpair describes Palworld as a "monster-catching, survival and crafting game" over on its Steam page, but notes it also features "a variety of mechanics from other genres in order to provide a completely new experience for everyone." And while harmonious living alongside the Pals you catch (initially totalling over 100) is certainly possible - with the likes of idyllic farming, land and sea exploration, dungeon crawling, battling, building, and breeding all featured - it also looks to have a darker side too, and not just because of those guns.


Players that choose to take on the game's ruthless poaching syndicate might, for example, find themselves traversing perilous climes where limited resources could mean they're forced to eat their Pals. Meanwhile, Pals can be put to work making fire, generating electricity, or mining ore, or sent to a factory line where they can be made to automate different tasks - until they drop dead, that is. Then, there's poaching, with players able to do crime, sneaking into wildlife sanctuaries to capture rare Pals that can be sold for cash.

Helldivers 2 follows the same basic template as its well-received predecessor (which earned a Eurogamer Recommended badge back in 2015), sending players - either working solo or in teams of up to four - on procedurally generated missions across hostile alien worlds to complete objectives, subjugate the locals, and orchestrate their escape. The likes of customisable loadouts and stratagems return in the sequel, but the major difference is a shift from a top-down perspective to third-person one this time around.


And now, Arrowhead has confirmed players across PlayStation 5 and PC will be able to experience all the above together, courtesy of Helldivers 2's crossplay support. "Community and teamwork are the most important pillars of Helldivers 2," it explained, "and so it is essential to ensure players can work together regardless of the system they choose to use. Together we can celebrate victories, mourn losses, and liberate the galaxy without platform boundaries."

Xbox fans rejoiced when Baldur's Gate 3 surprised-launched at the end of last year following an extended delay related to split-screen co-op, but things got off to a bumpy start, with some players soon reporting their saves were being lost after crashing - a frankly horrifying prospect for a title as lengthy and involved as Baldur's Gate 3.


Unfortunately, the issue has continued to persist in the weeks since; Larian recently offered a workaround to help players avoid the save issue, but noted that a permanent fix would require a firmware update from Microsoft, which was still in the works.

Wolfenstein developer MachineGames will showcase more than "more than 10 minutes of game and developer insights" including the first gameplay trailer. Expect to hear details about when the game will be set, what its story will be about, and "how fans will actually play as Indy". (Using a video game controller? An actual whip?! The mind boggles.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 10/01/24: The Apex Legends crossover event with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is live, meaning the cost of event packs is now confirmed.
As per the official Instagram video shared previously, the cost of event packs is 100 coins - reduced from the standard 1000 coins. 
However, the cost of packs actually increases depending on the number of items owned, as per the screenshot below. If players own 16 to 35 items, the cost of packs increases back to 1000 coins. It means if players want to own all 36 items (including the death box), it won't cost the full £360 but they'll still need to shell out a considerable amount.

The event begins later today in celebration of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth arriving next month, and includes a number of themed items, skins, and events. 


This is the first in-game crossover of its kind in Apex Legends and the potential cost of items is eye-watering for fans. On social media, the high cost has sparked fury in the game's community, although this is based on the current cost of packs that could be reduced once the event launches.

Its vision expands beyond just your regular cars and motorcycles, with talk of the sky, ocean and outer space being shared.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A The Last of Us spin-off TV series focusing on survivors Bill and Frank has been pitched.


The news comes from Nick Offerman, who recently won an Emmy for his portrayal of Bill in HBO's series.


Speaking backstage after the awards, the actor was asked about whether viewers could see more from Bill and Frank in the future. "Oh, great question but I would have to ask somebody with a higher pay grade than myself," he replied (thanks, Deadline).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has announced a further round of layoffs, less than two months after its previous job cuts, that'll see it eliminate roughly 25 percent of its total workforce - around 1,800 employees - as part of the "company reset" it unveiled at the end of last year.


Unity confirmed additional layoffs at the company were "likely" back in November, when it revealed it was assessing its portfolio "to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers". Shortly after, it announced it was ending its agreement with Weta FX, resulting in the loss of 265 jobs - the company's fourth round of layoffs since the start of 2022.


A fresh round of layoffs at Unity - the largest ever at the company - has now been confirmed in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. This time, around 1,800 employees will be affected, with the company saying the cuts come as it "restructures and refocuses on its core business" and seeks to "position itself for long-term and profitable growth."

Word Baldur's Gate 3 players were receiving bans for using an Xbox-approved feature with an Xbox-approved game (albeit in a way potentially violating Microsoft policy) surfaced last week, and developer Larian quickly moved to assure fans it was working with Microsoft to sort out the "annoying and uncool" suspensions. Shortly after it said affected parties should start seeing their bans lifted, and that "Work is ongoing, and the Microsoft team is aware of the issue!".


A week on and Microsoft itself has now acknowledged the situation in a statement on social media. "To provide clarity on Baldur's Gate 3 mature content enforcement actions," it wrote, "Xbox account suspensions are not automatic. Each clip is reviewed by a moderator and, if found in violation of our safety and content policies, actioned accordingly."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following speculation Microsoft may be considering bringing its acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush to Switch, new reports have claimed the company has also been looking into a PlayStation and Switch release for developer Rare's acclaimed multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves.


Journalist and prolific leaker Jeff Grubb initially claimed Microsoft had been eyeing up a potential PlayStation and Switch release for Sea of Thieves on his Game Mess podcast earlier today. That was followed by a similar story from former Axios journalist Stephen Totilo, writing on his newly launched Game File website.


Totilo offered a slightly different spin on Grubb's report, saying he'd heard Microsoft had considered releasing Sea of Thieves on PlayStation, but that his "source familiar with plans for the port" had made no mention of Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 9/1/24: Magic: The Gathering maker Wizards of the Coast has issued a statement saying it will work with external vendors to ensure AI-generated artwork is kept out of promotional material for the game. 
The statement follows the recent departure of an artist at the company, who said he had quit in protest at the promotional material.
"Thanks to our diligent community who pointed out a series of recent marketing images may have included elements of generative AI, we are rethinking our process of how we work with vendors for our marketing creative," Wizards of the Coast wrote in a new statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artist Dave Rapoza has quit working for Wizards of the Coast following claims recent promotional material used for Magic: The Gathering was generated using AI tools.
Although Wizards of the Coast refuted accusations that a recent image was generated via AI, fans and artists alike were quick to point out inconsistencies with the image.
The charge is particularly emotive given Wizards of the Coast confirmed last month that it "require[s] artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the Magic TCG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final Magic products".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A remake of the original Metal Gear Solid game is reportedly still in development at Konami.
According to the Spanish website Areajugones – which previously, and correctly, leaked God of War Regnarök's DLC existence ahead of a formal announcement – "Konami is still working on a remake of the first installment, although right now Metal Gear Solid Delta is a priority in the studio".
The website reports that the claim comes from "multiple sources" and suggests that it will only be playable on PS5, not PS4. Similarly, there's been no mention of a PC or Xbox release, either. Given Metal Gear Solid Delta is coming to multiple platforms, though, it stands to reason that the Metal Gear Solid Remake will, too. But all we can do is wait for official confirmation.

Unfortunately there's still no release date for the expansion beyond 'summer 2024'.

As reported by Law360 and spotted by our sister site, GamesIndustry.biz, the complaint includes allegations against former CEO Bobby Kotick for remarks he made at an unspecified leadership conference in which he reportedly said that the "problem" at ABK was that "there are too many old white guys".
The filing – lodged by a 57-year-old white man who worked at the company from 2014 until he was laid off as part of the company's restructure in late 2023 – says that shortly after hearing these comments, a pair of white executives left "based, at least in part, on Kotick's ageist remarks", adding that "Activision placed profits over people by terminating the older, higher-paid executives".

It appears Netflix would only serve advertisements to ad-supported subscribers, but is also considering offering "sophisticated" games for additional cost on top of the subscription fee.

<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.</p>
<p>And, yes, this is the eighteenth anniversary of Friday Squid Blogging. The <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/friday_squid_bl.html">first squid post</a> is from January 6, 2006, and I have been posting them weekly since then.

To fully appreciate this tribute, we need to go back a few years. When Baldur's Gate 3 was still in early access, forum user Solfalia messaged Larian to thank the studio for releasing Act I, despite the game not being complete. This release allowed Solfalia to play the game - as it was at the time - with their father, who had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Their father had played other Larian games in the past and was a fan, so this opportunity meant a lot to them both.


"This Early Access means that this Xmas I'll be able to go on an adventure with him one last time, and I know he'll enjoy it," Solfalia wrote in their original post from 2020.

In a new video from the developer focused specifically on accessibility, the team shared how they have approached this release, with senior gameplay programmer Christophe De Labrouhe stating "Metroidvania games can be quite hard, and this one can be quite hard too". 


But while The Lost Crown can be challenging, the team doesn't want this to put players off, and so has included a variety of accessibility options as standard. This includes larger text by default, no quick time events and "no colour-based feedback". In addition, there will be options that will allow players to customise the gameplay difficulty to a style that's best for them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 8/1/2024: Baldur's Gate 3 Xbox players whose capture clips have been flagged by Microsoft should start to see their bans lifted. 
Developer Larian shared an update on X (formerly Twitter) over the weekend, to state work is ongoing to sort these bans. The bans in question saw players being penalised for capturing in-game footage containing nudity, which was then uploaded to Xbox servers.
"Microsoft team is aware of the issue," the developer said. "If you're wanting to upload any clips in the meantime, make sure to turn off mature content."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Larian is working alongside Microsoft to sort out "annoying and uncool" account bans, which can happen when Baldur's Gate 3 footage containing nudity gets uploaded to Xbox servers. 


This all stems back to the weekend, when Reddit user Daddy-Vegas warned other Baldur's Gate 3 players about capturing certain footage in Larian's award-winning RPG. The Redditor recorded "some naked camp time fun", which they planned to share with their brother. Xbox then automatically uploaded the footage to its servers. 


However, if Xbox discovers imagery it deems offensive, the content is removed and the player's profile will be "temporarily prohibited from sharing additional imagery (typically for 24 hours)". And, as Daddy-Vegas' clips included that aforementioned nudity, they were met with a ban for each clip, which resulted in their account being suspended for a year. They have since appealed their ban, with the Redditor revealing earlier this week their efforts were successful.

The MIG-Switch flash cart, officially, is a "third party back-up and development device for the Nintendo Switch" according to the device website, that's not endorsed nor licenced by Nintendo of Japan. While the idea behind the device is players can back up games they own legally, it also opens the door for piracy and for people to potentially play roms of games they do not own.
However, Bowser - who was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices back in 2022 - said he was "not involved" in any aspect of the MIG-Switch. Rather, the hacker reportedly said he had been the "subject of DNS poisoning attack on [his] nameservers" (thanks, VGC).

The Monty Mole Collection comprises five games, covering the original Monty Mole saga. This includes the main trilogy of games: Wanted! Monty Mole, Monty on the Run, and Auf Wiedersehen Monty. 


In addition, there are two bonus games to enjoy: Moley Christmas (which was originally given away with a magazine. As the name suggests, it will provide players with a "seasonal adventure") and Sam Stoat: Safebreaker. This is the "solo adventure of Sam Stoat, a supporting character from the main Monty Mole games".

In a world first, 13-year-old Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson - who is a competitive Tetris player - has managed to get the decades old falling block game to reveal its "kill screen". While not your traditional end of game, with credits or even game over message, this screen essentially sees Tetris crash. This is beating Tetris, a once thought impossible feat. 


The delight shown by the young player, who was born over two decades after the game actually released, as the screen freezes is palpable. "Oh my god," Gibson repeats. "I'm going to pass out, I can't feel my fingers."

"We are not interested in integrating ourselves into any larger entity," Kiciński told the publication. "Throughout our entire lives we have worked towards the position we currently hold. We believe that in a few years, we will be even bigger and stronger." The exec said the company has "ambitious plans" for the future, but it values its independence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrainian studio Frogwares is now the sole publisher of Lovecraft-inspired detective adventure The Sinking City. This follows the conclusion of a legal dispute with publisher Nacon, in which Frogwares accused the company of claiming copyright of The Sinking City after its release, withholding milestone payments, and owing the developer unpaid royalties.


The dispute between the two companies saw Frogwares attempting to remove The Sinking City from PC storefront Steam in a bid to sever its ties to Nacon. In February 2021, Frogwares then told people not to buy its game from Steam and the following month it issued The Sinking City with a DMCA takedown. At this time, it claimed Nacon had "illegally" uploaded a hacked version to Valve's platform.


Now, Frogwares is the sole publisher of The Sinking City across all platforms. In a post appropriately shared on Steam, the studio said it was "happy to put this whole thing behind" it, and is now looking forward to "sharing more news about the future of the franchise down the line".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's upcoming open world Star Wars game Outlaws looks to be set for a "late" 2024 release. 


Until today, the Ubisoft game held a much wider ranging 2024 release window. However, a Disney Parks blog post promoting a variety of events and such for the next 12 months has Star Wars Outlaws listed as arriving towards the tail end of the year. 


"Star Wars Outlaws, the open world Star Wars game, is set to release late this year," the post reads (thanks, IGN). "The game lets you explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. You can risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. If you're willing to take the risk, the galaxy is full of opportunity."

The award-winning RPG released on Microsoft's consoles last month, however many have experienced issues getting their games to save. Both Microsoft and developer Larian acknowledged this following the game's Xbox launch, but issues are still persisting weeks later. 


In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), Larian assured players Microsoft is working on an official fix for the game's save issues, which it said are being caused by a firmware issue.

<blockquote><p>To test PIGEON&#8217;s performance, I gave it five personal photos from a trip I took across America years ago, none of which have been published online. Some photos were snapped in cities, but a few were taken in places nowhere near roads or other easily recognizable landmarks.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t seem to matter much.</p>
<p>It guessed a campsite in Yellowstone to within around 35 miles of the actual location. The program placed another photo, taken on a street in San Francisco, to within a few city blocks.</p>
<p>Not every photo was an easy match: The program mistakenly linked one photo taken on the front range of Wyoming to a spot along the front range of Colorado, more than a hundred miles away. And it guessed that a picture of the Snake River Canyon in Idaho was of the Kawarau Gorge in New Zealand (in fairness, the two landscapes look remarkably similar)...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<p>Traditionally, people have been forced to reduce complex choices to a small handful of options that don&#8217;t do justice to their true desires. Artificial intelligence has the potential to remove that limitation. And it has the potential to drastically change how democracy functions.</p>

<blockquote><p>When Stolen Device Protection is turned on, Face ID or Touch ID authentication is required for additional actions, including viewing passwords or passkeys stored in iCloud Keychain, applying for a new Apple Card, turning off Lost Mode, erasing all content and settings, using payment methods saved in Safari, and more. No passcode fallback is available in the event that the user is unable to complete Face ID or Touch ID authentication.</p>
<p>For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple said there will be no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The PlayStation studio had stayed silent until now, something it said was a result of it being "focused inward" to support team members. Personal data was included in the breach, Insomniac confirmed, but the studio is still "working quickly" to examine the impact.


On the spread of stolen material relating to Marvel's Wolverine and other, upcoming game projects, Insomniac said it would share information "when the time was right".

News of the limits wiped a combined ~$80bn from the value of Tencent and NetEase, China's two main games publishers that now support or part-own many of the world's biggest games companies.


Chinese online video games will now no longer be able to offer an extra incentive to spend in a game for the first time, or for spending repeatedly, Reuters reported.

Arion Kurtaj, now 18, was part of the Lapsus$ hacking group behind similar attacks on Nvidia, Uber and BT, among others.


Kurtaj hacked Rockstar in September 2022, while already on bail for hacking charges and staying under police protection at a Travelodge, BBC News reported.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Wolverine is still years from release, but people are currently playing - and uploading footage - of an incomplete early development build found within the files stolen from Insomniac Games by ransomware hackers earlier this month. 


It's remarkable to see an in-development game being played in this way - and I can't think of a similar situation, at least in recent memory. The GTA 6 hack contained a mountain of development assets, yes, but nothing playable in this manner. 


Here, people have been able to access a test build of Wolverine akin to an internal demo meant for Insomniac and Sony, that features multiple sections of the game available to play and explore. Naturally, these sections are still incomplete and unpolished, but key gameplay mechanics and story moments are included.

Known as Tastes of the Seven Tribes, this book will allow you to whip up a batch of spicy Fireclaw stew or even some Bitterbrew Boar (which is described as "mouth-watering"). 


It's coming from Insight Editions, Rick Barba and prolific recipe writer Victoria Rosenthal, whose name you may recognise from a myriad of other video game related cookery books such as God of War's Official Cookbook of the Nine Realms and the Donlan-approved Destiny cookbook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games Store has relaxed its content guidelines for publishers to allow games which have been rated Adults Only by the ESRB, so long as the rating has only been applied due to the presence of blockchain technology.
The subtle changes were noticed two days ago on 19th December, when Epic announced two games, Gods Unchained and Striker Manager 3, have been relisted on its storefront. Both games were removed from the store after they received an Adults Only rating from the ESRB in the USA.
Previously, Epic banned all games with an Adults Only rating from its store but has openly welcomed blockchain games. In order to allow Gods Unchained and Striker Manager 3 back onto its store, Epic has tweaked its policies on prohibited content.

On 11th December, one user posted training material for the Norinco VT-4 tank (as reported by Cyber Daily). On 12th December, a user posted a manual for the M2A2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle (as reported by Task and Purpose).

Kotick's reign lasted 32 years, during which time the company became one of the biggest and most influential video games publishers on the planet. 


His departure this month is not unexpected - Activision Blizzard had previously confirmed Kotick's presence only until the end of this year to "ensure a smooth and seamless integration" following  Microsoft's long-winded but ultimately successful $68.7bn acquisition. Now, we know exactly when Kotick leaves and how the company will be shaped without him.

What is contextual logging?
Contextual logging
is based on the go-logr API.
The key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller
and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layers of Fear and The Medium developer Bloober Team is set to develop a game based on an IP owned by Skybound Entertainment, after a licensing and publishing agreement was signed by the two companies.
The game is currently codenamed R and is planned for an official reveal in 2025, according to Bloober's press release about the partnership (in Polish).

Skybound is most known for the comic series The Walking Dead, which was created by Skybound co-founder Robert Kirkman in 2010. Skybound established its subsidiary Skybound Games in 2018 to publish and license video games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 has now sold over 50m consoles worldwide since its launch in November 2020.


Sony announced the milestone today, and said PS5 had passed the 50m mark earlier this month, on 9th December. 


That means PS5 took 160 weeks and 2 days to reach the 50m milestone - just one week longer than PS4, despite severe sales constraints for much of its early lifecycle.

This page has raised some eyebrows, however, as the game is listed there as "The Suika Game" and not "Suika Game". The game's original developer is also not mentioned.


The original Suika Game was developed by Aladdin X and, so far, it has only been released on the Nintendo eShop, though many browser versions and clones on other platforms have since popped up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioWare and Mass Effect veteran Mac Walters has discussed his reasons for departing the studio after 19 years to begin work with a fresh team on a new sci-fi franchise.


In an interview with MinnMax, Walters detailed the various factors involved in his departure, from the desire to work on something brand new and not feeling able to within BioWare or EA, to the positive experience of working on the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition trilogy remaster with a small and "scrappy" team acting as a reminder of his early days at the studio and serving as a positive moment to make his exit.


Discussing the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition project, Walters described its approval by EA as something relatively "unplanned", compared to the careful assignment of teams long in advance to work on the studio's typical fare: mammoth big budget RPGs. This led to a different way of working which brought back fond memories, he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA is rebranding its in-house engine Frostbite to reflect its "renewed focus on partnership" with its studios, but also says its teams are "free to develop on any engine they choose".
Frostbite was originally developed by DICE for use in its Battlefield series, and has since been adopted internally at other studios also owned by its parent company EA.
Historically, the engine was used by BioWare to develop Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem to mixed reception on technical performance. Recently, it was used in this year's Dead Space remake and EA's numerous annual sports franchises.

Threats identified by Sony include Microsoft using Call of Duty to "disrupt and threaten console gaming and game subscription markets", with a potential "massive threat to PlayStation Plus".


Sony has frequently expressed its concerns about Microsoft's Activision Blizzard takeover in public and in private.

Community lead Dusty Gustaffson shared an update with players on Discord yesterday, revealing Embark has "had a technical issue that prevented us from banning cheaters efficiently", but is now in the process of "re-upping" anti-cheat measures as it implements a solution to the bug.

This blog discusses a new feature in Kubernetes 1.29 to improve the handling of taint-based pod eviction.
Background
In Kubernetes 1.29, an improvement has been introduced to enhance the taint-based pod eviction handling on nodes.
This blog discusses the changes made to node-lifecycle-controller
to separate its responsibilities and improve overall code maintainability.
Summary of changes
node-lifecycle-controller previously combined two independent functions:
Adding a pre-defined set of NoExecute taints to Node based on Node's condition.
Performing pod eviction on NoExecute taint.
With the Kubernetes 1.29 release, the taint-based eviction implementation has been
moved out of node-lifecycle-controller into a separate and independent compone…]]></summary>

With the recent release of Kubernetes 1.29, the PodReadyToStartContainers
condition is
available by default.
The kubelet manages the value for that condition throughout a Pod's lifecycle,
in the status field of a Pod. The kubelet will use the PodReadyToStartContainers
condition to accurately surface the initialization state of a Pod,
from the perspective of Pod sandbox creation and network configuration by a container runtime.
What's the motivation for this feature?
Cluster administrators did not have a clear and easily accessible way to view the completion of Pod's sandbox creation
and initialization. As of 1.28, the Initialized condition in Pods tracks the execution of init containers.
However, it has limitations in accurately re…]]></summary>

The leak has been dubbed the "teraleak" due to its sheer size and seemingly as a nod to the Nintendo "gigaleak" from 2020 which included prototypes of Star Fox 2 and Yoshi's Island, cut content from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, and more.
TestFlight is a service for developers to release iOS apps for testing. Files on Apple's servers were found archived via Wayback Machine and then shared anonymously to X (née Twitter). Links to the archives can be found quite easily by entering "TestFlight leak" into your chosen search engine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced a range of offers across a selection of Xbox games, as well as its Series X/S consoles and Elite controllers.


If you head over to the Microsoft Store now, you will be able to save £100 on an Xbox Series X (although, while this is the official line from Microsoft, I am currently seeing a deal saving £110). This deal will run until 7th January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has filed a patent which could see difficulty levels adapt and adjust as users play. 


The patent features algorithms that would be able to finely tune difficulty settings based on an individual's performance. It is interesting to see Sony patent such an idea, when similar processes are used in other games already. 


Regardless, this patent (which can be viewed via World Intellectual Property Organization), shows PlayStation has its eye on the future of this sort of technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabotage Studio, developer of indie RPG Sea of Stars, has removed the appearance of YouTuber Jirard "The Completionist" Khalil as a cameo in the game. The move follows the ongoing investigations into The Open Hand Foundation, a fundraising body created by Khalil's family.
Sabotage and Khalil had a close working relationship, with Khalil consistently giving the studio a spot in IndieLand, an annual charity stream to support The Open Hand Foundation, and supporting Sea of Stars on Kickstarter. Sabotage created specific content for use in IndieLand, and eventually added Khalil as an NPC called Jirard the Constructionist in the release version of Sea of Stars. 
But now there are allegations Khalil committed charity fraud through The Open Hand Foundation, via YouTubers Mutahar "SomeOrdinaryGamers" Anas and Karl Jobst. Following further investigations, and responses from Khalil, Anas, and Jobst, Sabotage has now replaced Jirard the Constructionist in a new Sea of Stars patch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new TimeSplitters project recently in development at Free Radical Design was originally pitched as a battle royale game to rival Fortnite, a developer on the project has claimed. 


This year, however, the project then took a "massive 180" to become something else - something the studio reportedly much preferred: an expanded remake of TimeSplitters 2 with extra content and a few plot changes.


"Originally it was a Fortnite clone. Nobody wanted that really, not even us, but we didn't have much of a choice for a long time," the developer told fan wiki The Free Radical Archive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios James Gunn has said Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League won't be the last we see of the Arkham Universe.


In a brief back and forth on social media platform Threads, Gunn was asked outright if Rocksteady's upcoming release would be the last game set in this universe. In response, Gunn replied: "No plans of it being the last." This post has since been removed from the platform, although it remains thanks to screenshots of the exchange. 


In another post - which remains live at the time of writing - Gunn said he was looking forward to the release of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and "hopefully more". He added he was a "fan".
