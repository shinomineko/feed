Routes are Pokémon Go's first major dabble with user-generated content, and are designed to be short paths for players to follow, suggested by members of local communities.

The emulator was first announced to be coming to Steam earlier this year, with the team behind it calling this a "product of many months of work".

However, a few months down the line, the team has dropped plans to launch Dolphin on Valve's platform. In a blog update detailing this decision, the Dolphin team addressed the recently-reported DMCA takedown, stating Nintendo "did not send Valve or Dolphin a Digital Millennium Copyright Act", nor has it "taken any legal action against Dolphin Emulator or Valve".

Described by Strange Scaffold as a "third-person love letter to classic shooters", the game tasks players, as protagonist James Savage, with battling various supernatural enemies whilst descending through 50 floors of a motel to hunt down Draculae, the lord of vampires and Savage's former lover. The Max Payne era of shooters is cited as the main inspiration for the game.

The release date was announced with an animated music video for Stay Awake, a song from the game's hip-hop soundtrack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Sleep players with access to the game's £50 Pokémon Go Plus+ peripheral are pretending to sleep in order to quickly speed towards Pokémon Go rewards. 


The new nap-tracking app requires you record at least 90 minutes of sleep per day - and it's this minimum which users are now recording, before manually changing the date on their phones to then record another 90 minutes, and so forth. 


Repeating this method allows you to rack up rewards for recording a week's worth of sleep (albeit no less than 90 minutes at a time) in just a few hours, users writing on Pokémon fan reddit TheSilphRoad say. And doing so seems fairly straightforward, with the app's sleep sensor simply turned off and on without you actually having to be asleep.

Despite scooping the prize for Excellence in Design at the Independent Games Festival in 2020, the game made a relatively small splash when it first released last year for PC.
Patrick's Parabox is a sokoban mixed with recursion, filled with boxes inside of boxes. You play as Patrick, a small box, and you push around boxes to where they need to go. Sometimes, you push around boxes which contain the puzzle you're actually in, and then you can enter that box. The trailer below probably sums it up better than I could in words.

<blockquote><p>So far, at least three trends emerge:</p>
<p>First, the plan contains a (somewhat) more concrete list of actions than its parent strategy, with useful delineation of lead and supporting agencies, as well as timelines aplenty. By assigning each action a designated lead and timeline, and by including a new nominal section (6) focused entirely on assessing effectiveness and continued iteration, the ONCD suggests that this is not so much a standalone text as the framework for an annual, crucially iterative policy process. That many of the milestones are still hazy might be less important than the commitment. the administration has made to revisit this plan annually, allowing the ONCD team to leverage their unique combination of topical depth and budgetary review authority...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 recently made headlines when it was reported the game would have 17,000 ending variations. It's a claim that comes from an interview with one of the game's lead writers by YouTuber Fextralife, and related specifically to the differences which might flavour the more general core paths to the game's ending.


Lead writer Adam Smith has now shed further light on these variations, and further confirmed they don't  equate to endgame states. Rather, Baldur's Gate 3's narrative should be thought of as a "big spider web", he said, with the endgame in the centre. 


"It's not that you start at point A, and then you keep branching and branching and branching," Smith explained to GamesRadar. "That's often how people think of it, but the problem with that would be that if I make a choice, then I branch over here, and suddenly I'm over here and I can't get back [to the trunk]."

In a statement, Netflix said it had seen a "healthy conversion of borrower households" into paid accounts, and that the number of account cancellations in protest at the changes had been low.

In the world of Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at

SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving the Kubernetes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard's latest financial earnings report has arrived, and while it's good news for the company as a whole, Blizzard in particular has had a stellar quarter, surpassing $1bn USD in net bookings for the first time ever thanks to the launch of Diablo 4.


In its second quarter earnings report for the latest financial year, Activision Blizzard announced 50% year-over-year growth in net bookings, with the company amassing $2.46bn compared to the $1.64bn it reported in the second quarter of 2022.


That's down to a mix of increased "player investment in live operations content" across games such as Call of Duty, which rose by 17%, and "another quarterly net bookings record at King". The big applause, though, is reserved for Diablo 4, which, as of the end of Blizzard's record-breaking second quarter - which saw the studio's segment revenue grow by 160% year-over-year and its operating revenue more than triple - has "sold-through more units than any other Blizzard title at an equivalent stage of release."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard is taking its first tentative steps away from Battle.net exclusivity, starting with the launch of Overwatch 2 on Steam this August and the promise of more games on the way.


Battle.net has been at the core of Blizzard's games since its release back in 1996, and the studio's PC titles have remained exclusively available through the platform in the years since, making it one of the few companies to have entirely snubbed Steam.


That will change on 10th August when Blizzard's free-to-play shooter sequel Overwatch 2 arrives on Valve's storefront, where it'll incorporate native features including Steam Achievements and Steam friends list integration. And perhaps we might even see official Steam Deck support on the way? Blizzard does note, however, that players will still be required to connect the game to a Battle.net account to enable features including cross-platform play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of Sonic Boom. I know, that might be controversial. Sonic fans have long debated which Sonic CD soundtrack is best between the Japanese and American releases. 


For the opening at least, I've always loved the American version: Sonic Boom. The chugging electric guitars! The earworm vocal harmonies! The key shift from verse to chorus! Japan's You Can Do Anything is a funky 90s bop that just sounds inherently Sonic, while Sonic Boom set the tone for the later rock-heavy Sonic Adventure games. I prefer that classic 90s sound overall but something about "Sonic boooom Sonic boooom" gets me so excited for another high-speed adventure - what can I say, I like the cheese.


All of which is to say, I love the Sonic animation intros. And the just-released intro for Sega's forthcoming Sonic Superstars is hitting all the right notes.

In December last year, a group of 10 gamers teamed up to file a federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. The case aimed to argue that Microsoft's acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision would "foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition".

Scrolling through the hefty patch notes there are a number of buffs and debuffs across all classes, but the biggest impact is on the Sorcerer that's been nerfed.


That's due to a reduction in bonus damage for the Devouring Blaze skill, a popular choice for many playing as that class.

It's been something of a long road to Pokémon Sleep's release - the app was first announced back in 2019, when it was expected to launch the following year - but it's now finally here, giving users tools to track the length and quality of their sleep, and - crucially, given it's the whole hook of the thing - gather in-game Pokémon based on the success of their slumber.


Depending on the categories of sleep players manage to achieve during their downtime - "dozing", "snoozing" or "slumbering", for instance - they're able to attract different sets of Pokémon, and the whole process is overseen by new Pokémon professor, Neroli.

In the latest instalment of Nintendo's Ask The Developer series of interviews, Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto spoke alongside former series directors Shigefumi Hino and Masamichi Abe, as well as programmer Yuji Kando and designer Junji Morii on the origins of the series. 
Hino revealed initially the team had planned to feature creatures with AI chips in their heads in the first Pikmin game, and players would be able to control them by assigning different chips. The concept art for this prototype was shown, and the early Pikmin would have looked like round creatures with limbs, a nose, eyes, and an antenna.

<blockquote><p>The group got the idea for the conings by chance. The person claims a few of them walking together one night saw a cone on the hood of an AV, which appeared disabled. They weren&#8217;t sure at the time which came first; perhaps someone had placed the cone on the AV&#8217;s hood to signify it was disabled rather than the other way around. But, it gave them an idea, and when they tested it, they found that a cone on a hood renders the vehicles little more than a multi-ton hunk of useless metal. The group suspects the cone partially blocks the LIDAR detectors on the roof of the car, in much the same way that a human driver wouldn&#8217;t be able to safely drive with a cone on the hood. But there is no human inside to get out and simply remove the cone, so the car is stuck...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft fans have spotted an intriguing addition to the veteran MMO that's distinctly themed around Fortnite. 


Datamined details of an upcoming boss encounter scooped up by Wowhead reveal the abilities of a new "Renegade Looter" enemy to include "Cranking 90s", "One Pump", "Slurp Drink" and "Disco Bomb". For the uninitiated, all of these are references to Epic Games' ever-popular battle royale. 


Cranking 90s, for example, refers to the player ability to build a vertical tower at speed. In World of Warcraft, it will allow the Renegade Looter boss to "rapidly construct a tower to gain the high ground".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has shared a little more information on what players can expect from the game's 1.6 update.

Barone confirmed the update was in development back in June 2022, though at the time described it as largely a "modding-focused update". While suggesting update 1.6 will have some new content, Barone was clear it would not have as much as 1.5, added back in December 2020.

Now, Barone has shared a fresh update on what's coming to Stardew Valley in 1.6 that sounds more promising - prompting excitment from fans at what's in store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority have been formally granted two months to reach a new agreement following a joint request to the Competition Appeal Tribunal.


The CMA officially blocked Microsoft's proposed $69BN acquisition of Activision Blizzard back in April, highlighting concerns relating to the fledgling cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk "stifling competition in this growing market".


However, following the US Federal Trade Commission's failure to secure a temporarily halt on the deal in court last week, the CMA indicated it would be open to a "new merger investigation" if Microsoft was willing to restructure its Activision Blizzard deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 developer Starbreeze Studios has released a new trailer showcasing its upcoming heist shooter's stealth gameplay. Unfortunately, it released it so sneakily, it went undiscovered for five days and the studio ended up having to tell everyone where it'd hidden it.


In a moment of perhaps misguided whimsy, someone at Starbreeze (thanks PC Gamer) thought it would be a fun idea to hide its new trailer in appropriately stealthy fashion by squirrelling it behind the existing trailer on the Payday 3 website - so that it only popped into view when the volume slider was turned all the way down or when the site was visited in Incognito mode.


Starbreeze began to realise it might have been a bit too sneaky when, some five days later, the trailer still lay undiscovered. And so - after an initial, ultimately failed prompt on Twitter - the studio turned, somewhat inexplicably, to the medium of exceptionally bad poetry in a desperate bid to nudge fans in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Codename Jade, the Ancient China-set free-to-play mobile game from Tencent's  Level Infinite, will start its first closed beta on 3rd August, Ubisoft has confirmed.


Announced last September, Codename Jade is a fully fledged open-world Assassin's Creed game set in second century BC China (placing it chronologically between Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Origins) and featuring the Qin dynasty.


Players create their own character - the adopted child of master Wei Yu - in Codename Jade, eventually embarking on a quest for revenge after their close friend is betrayed. "But as they delve deeper into their mission," Ubisoft teases, "they will uncover secrets about the past and a powerful force that threatens to destroy everything they hold dear."

It features exactly the kind of gear you'd want if you had plans to march through rain capable of instantly withering you into an aged husk, complete with Odradek Terrain Scanner, and your very own Bridge-Baby-in-a-jar which is also bean shaped, naturally.

In the case of Venba, it's both. If you've played the demo, the care and attention to detail of the game's opening level is clear. Now I've seen more, courtesy of a preview presentation and roundtable interview with game designer and creative director Abhi. I came away appreciating how Venba wears its heart on its sleeve, regardless of whether or not you pick up on every single reference.

Venba takes place across three decades, and follows the story of a couple - Venba and her husband Paavalan - after they've emigrated from South India to Canada. Venba touches on themes of immigration, family, culture and assimilation, and food is the language it uses to navigate these conversations.

This comes as part of new regulation laid out by the Council of the European Union which aims to "regulate the entire life cycle of batteries" to ensure they are "safe, sustainable and competitive". 


The idea is batteries are easier to replace and recycle, with a guarantee that "portable batteries incorporated into appliances should be removable and replaceable by the end-user" within new devices from 2027 onwards.

Whilst that may not sound impressive given the PUBG: Battlegrounds' record-breaking peak currently sits at a hefty 3.2m players, it's important to note that even though TF2 is widely considered one of the greatest shooters of all time, it's just about to turn 16 years old.

According to SteamDB, the game has never been more popular, not even when it switched from a premium to a free-to-play model in 2011. And the most recent record of 253,997 concurrent players more than doubles the prior record of 167,591, which was set back in December 2022.

Just hours after US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, who presided over the main case, rejected the FTC's initial motion to appeal against this week's Microsoft and Activision Blizzard ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had similarly shut down a request for emergency relief.

"The motion for injunctive relief is denied," the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals filing states. "The existing briefing schedule remains in effect."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Nichiporchik, CEO of Hello Neighbor publisher TinyBuild, has raised eyebrows during a keynote in which he outlined potential uses of AI tools in the workplace, including the monitoring of employee Slack messages and meeting transcriptions to help identify "potential problematic players" - a discussion he has since insisted was "hypothetical".


Nichiporchik (as reported by WhyNowGaming) was speaking at this week's Develop: Brighton conference, in a talk titled 'AI in Gamedev: Is My Job Safe?' which promised an "in-depth [look] into how [TinyBuild] adopted AI in daily practices to exponentially increase efficiency".


One part of the presentation in particular, focusing on "AI for HR", has proved especially contentious since news of its contents began to spread around the internet. Here, Nichiporchik discussed how AI could be used by HR to spot burnout (later described as being synonymous with "toxicity") among employees by first identifying "potential problematic team members" then collating and running their Slack messages and automatic transcriptions from the likes of Google Meet and Zoom through Chat GPT, in a process he terms "I, Me Analysis".

Haptics firm Owo's Mirage-themed tie-in has been created in partnership with Ubisoft and looks something like an extremely snug short-sleeved shirt, albeit packaged alongside various bits of hardware. While wearing one, players can experience "multiple different sensations" that reflect those of Assasson's Creed Mirage's protagonist Basim.


Owo says these "sensations" will include the likes of "impacts and parkour", with the standard version of the haptic suit able to mimic 30 different sensations, including "axe", "insect bites", "severe abdominal wound", and "ball".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larry "Major Nelson" Hryb, long one of the most recognisable presences on the Xbox team, has announced his departure from Microsoft after 22 years.


Hryb has been with Microsoft since early 2001, initially serving as editor-in-chief for MSN Music before joining the company's Xbox division two years later. As a senior product manager for Xbox, Hryb was focused on helping shape the Xbox Live community experience - he credits himself as being a key contributor in features such as Xbox's Achievement system and party chat - and would go on to become senior director of corporate communications in 2012.


Over the years, Major Nelson - a name derived form Hryb's Gamertag - has been something of a figurehead for Xbox, relaying Xbox-Live-related information to the community and having a prominent presence in its various community focused blogs, livestreams, podcasts, and shows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari's 1979 arcade classic Lunar Lander is being reimagined by Dreams Uncorporated, the studio behind last year's striking Cris Tales, for release in early 2024.


The original Lunar Lander (perhaps the most famous entry in a sub-genre that can be traced back as far as 1969) was exquisite in its compelling simplicity, requiring players to do nothing more than carefully park their lunar landing module at a fixed point on the Moon's rugged terrain - by manipulating their craft's thrusters and controlling its orientation.


Dream Uncorporated's reimagining, though, which will be known as Lunar Lander: Beyond, is looking to do something a little bit different, taking the moon landing premise of the arcade original and infusing it with a "rich back story" and "deep narrative". There's also talk of "simulation" and "precision gravity flier mechanics" in the studio's announcement.

miHoYo's statement to Eurogamer suggests it is only learning of the situation now, and that the missing payments were the fault of a local recording studio which it has now "immediately urged" to sort the situation. 

Indeed, miHoYo says it is now "also seeking alternative solutions" to resolve the matter - and presumably make sure it never happens again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Simogo's Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is a game about "unravelling a big secret".


A new trailer for the game was shown at the recent Annapurna Showcase, but with its abstract aesthetic it's difficult to ascertain exactly how the game will play.



That was intentional, however. "We aim to try to raise questions, instead of answering them," said game director Simon Flesser. "We want to make viewers wonder, and think."

There were a few questionable faces in there, admittedly, with Brazilian Womens' legend Miranda looking quietly terrifying up in the top left, and Ronaldino not quite at his best, but the biggest standout was Andrea Pirlo, the iconic now-retired Italian holding midfielder. 


Pirlo looks especially out of place because unlike everyone else in the group shot, he's just wearing a plain, unbranded blue t-shirt amongst a sea of official kits. He's also staring blankly into space, leading to plenty of comments joking he looked a little lost.

Ahead of the game's release on PlayStation 5, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart was touted as a showcase for the  capabilities of Sony's new console, and in particular the fast loading of its SSD. Indeed, creative director Marcus Smith stated in an official PlayStation video that the game's dimensional rift hopping "would not have been possible without the Solid State Drive of the PlayStation 5".

In court documents shared as part of the ongoing saga between the US Federal Trade Commission and Microsoft, the FTC said Microsoft had forecasted 10m sales on PlayStation for "both Starfield and Indiana Jones".


Xbox's Tim Stuart said Microsoft had forecasted PlayStation sales in order to evaluate the impact of making ZeniMax games exclusive. Ultimately, the company believed it could "offset losses incurred from making ZeniMax games exclusive through Game Pass and increased console sales".

The regulator was expected to formally block the deal - as previously announced - on 18th July, but Microsoft has since submitted a "detailed and complex" proposal with changes in circumstances (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz).



As such, the CMA will take another six weeks to consider the new submission, with this revised period ending 29th August.

US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, who presided over the main case, rejected the FTC's call for an appeal late last night. 


With this avenue now closed, the FTC has subsequently launched a new push for a "temporary pause" on Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, Reuters has reported, this time with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

He'll be hanging up his sword and locks of white in the show's upcoming Season 3 Volume 2, which Netlix is now teasing in a newly released trailer.


Season 3 of Netflix's wonky The Witcher adaptation kicked off with five new episodes at the end of June, and it'll come to a close with the release of three more episodes on 27th July.


And as for what's in store, lots of special effects, overwrought emotion, and a whole heap of action judging by Netflix's new Volume 2 trailer, which also manages to chuck in a unicorn and far too much of Jaskier's terrible Season 3 haircut for my liking.

Stray Gods (subtitled The Roleplaying Musical for the benefit of those with leaky genre brain) was originally due to launch on 3rd August, but Summerfall Studios - where Gaider is co-founder and creative director - has now revised its release date to 10th August, explaining, "We want everyone to have ample space to check out Stray Gods when it launches. Baldur’s Gate 3 is hotly anticipated (by us, too!) and we want to give our fans room to celebrate Stray Gods."


However, it seems Larian's fantasy epic isn't the only reason for Stray Gods' short delay; Summerfall calls releasing the game across Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC simultaneously a "huge undertaking for any team, let alone an indie shipping its first title" and says the extra week "allows us to have performance parity as close as possible - across every platform."

As spotted by Insider Gaming, actor and singer Luke Charles Stafford recently shared a post on Facebook claiming Activision would be using his likeness for "their next main character" in a Call of Duty apparently set to release "next year".


"Activision decided to adapt their next main character, 'Ratcliffe' for Call of Duty off my face/likeness, and I am elated," Stafford wrote. "To all of my college roommate back at Anderson University and those years in Smith Hall Playing Black Ops 2... Next year, we can beat the snot out of each other again, but I want to play as me."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has finally whipped back the veil of secrecy around its FIFA replacement EA Sports FC in cash-splashing style, revealing a whole heap of new league licensing deals, new gameplay details, and (as widely expected) a release date of 29th September this year.


EA Sports FC24 is, of course, EA's first major football outing without the FIFA brand, which the publisher announced it was ditching last May. Since then, we've been introduced to EA Sports FC's official logo (it's a triangle made of letters with a triangle in it), and, more recently, had a reveal for the game's premium-priced Ultimate Edition cover. Which was a tad unsettling.


Today, though, it's all go on the EA Sports FC24 news front, as EA aimed to convince of its continuing place in football with a flashy, no-expenses-spared showcase featuring the likes Alex Scott, Didier Drogba, Luís Figo, Ronaldinho, Leah Williams, and Erling Haaland - who'll feature on the cover of EA Sports FC24's Standard Edition.

The latest line of Pikmin merch on the UK and Ireland website for My Nintendo Store comes in the form of bud vases, a vase for a single flower, in the shape of Pikmin.
It's an adorable idea, as you can put a leaf, bud, or open flower in to make the Pikmin look how they do in-game. You can even branch out and put different varieties of flowers in, taking some inspiration from the mobile Pokémon Go-like game Pikmin Bloom.

Banishers was unveiled in December last year, and is a supernatural action RPG which follows the story of ghost-hunters (and lovers) Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith. The pair go to New Eden, a community being haunted by spirits, where Antea becomes a spirit herself. 
Today, Dont Nod has announced a release date along with a new trailer which gives a few more hints about the game's plot. The video below shows the perspective of Charles Davenport, a friend of the protagonists who seems to blame himself for what has happened to them.

The programme was announced last month for launch in October, and is set to offer a 70/30 revenue split - higher than the usual 50/50 between streamers and Twitch. However, the criteria for this higher revenue split is very specific, meaning few streamers will likely reach the necessary requirements.



Speaking to Eurogamer at TwitchCon Paris, many Twitch Partners criticised the programme and stated its threshold was unattainable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown, the latest instalment in the open-world racing series, has been delayed again, and is now due to arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Switch in "early 2024". In better news, its long-promised closed beta begins later this month.


Solar Crown - which ambitiously promises a full digital recreation of Hong Kong Island and its 550km of roads to recklessly careern around - got its official unveiling back in 2020, and was originally expected to launch across all platforms in September last year.


However, as May 2022 rolled around, publisher Nacon announced it was shifting Solar Crown's release back to some undisclosed point in 2023, and confirmed it was ceasing development of the previously announced PS4 and Xbox One versions "with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles and maximising the overall quality of the game".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Controversial game platform Roblox is adding support for Meta Quest VR headsets.


Reports that Roblox was coming to Meta Quest first surfaced earlier this year, when sources told The Verge the move would likely happen toward the end of 2023. It now seems those estimates were a little off; today's confirmation of incoming Meta Quest support doesn't provide an exact launch date, but it does reveal an open beta will be added to Meta Quest's App Lab "soon".


In an official announcement on the Roblox developer forum, the company explained, "Traditionally, developing a VR experience required a team that had VR-specific experience and skills. With Roblox, developers will soon be able to publish their existing experiences to support VR with little to no additional coding effort required. This is because Roblox is designed to be universal, allowing the same experiences to run everywhere."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed its next batch of Game Catalogue additions for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, which, as of 18th July, will include the likes of It Takes Two, Undertale, World War Z, The Ascent, and - for Premium retro fans - Twisted Metal 1 and 2.


It Takes Two (PS4, PS5) is one of July's big draws, serving up some acclaimed co-op platform action as Cody and May, two parents-turned-toys on the edge of a divorce, must battle against the odds to return to the real-world. The Game Catalogue version includes a Friend's Pass, meaning someone who has the game can invite a friend who doesn't to play for free.


It's joined by Neon Giant's absolutely gorgeous top-down cyberpunk action-shooter RPG The Ascent (PS4, PS5); Saber Interactive's well-received four-play co-op zombie slayer World War Z (PS4, PS5); Toby Fox's cult favourite RPG Undertale (PS4); extreme off-road action in SnowRunner (PS4, PS5), and long-distance tactical blasting in Sniper Elite 5 (PS4, PS5).

Word of a remake for Need for Speed: Most Wanted comes via <a href="https://twitter.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1679059692981747712
">now-deleted Instagram and Twitter posts (as spotted over on the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit) from actor Simone Bailly who - alongside various television appearances over the years in the likes of Stargate SG-1 and The L Word - played Officer Turf in the original 2005 game.


According to Bailly, a "Need for Speed: Most Wanted Remake is being release in 2024", and we can surmise it's a new version of EA Vancouver's 2005 original rather than developer Criterion Games' 2012 racer of the same name, as Bailly says she'll once again be starring as the "partner" of protagonist Sergeant Jonathan Cross.

Chatting at Develop:Brighton earlier today, studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said Guerrilla faced technical challenges when developing the Zero Dawn sequel, as it was releasing across two generations of consoles. 


"It was almost up until the last moment that we didn't know whether we could support the flying on PlayStation 4," the developer said (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). "We were like, 'Do we need to cut the whole feature of the game? That's going to make such a mess'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to this week's milestone court decision which clears the way for Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal in the US, and potentially in the UK as well.

We discuss why the court sided with Microsoft and what is likely to happen next, including what remedies Microsoft may be considering to get the deal over the line with the UK as well. Could we see a future where the UK lacks Call of Duty streaming on Game Pass? Or any form of streaming via Game Pass altogether?
Finally, we ponder the games industry's next steps in general. Will the sale of Activision Blizzard further open the floodgates to yet more acquisitions? And how will Sony counter? Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has suggested a "new merger investigation" into Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard is not out of the question, following Microsoft's court case win against the US Federal Trade Commission yesterday. 


The CMA has remained an outlier in Microsoft's ongoing bid to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard, being one of the only bodies to oppose the deal. 


In April, the CMA cited concerns over the deal's proposed impact on the cloud gaming sector as its reason for blocking the acquisition, stating Microsoft's ownership of Activision Blizzard risked "stifling competition in this growing market".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's currently a question mark hanging over the Xbox versions of Baldur's Gate 3. They are happening but they're held up by Xbox Series S, which is struggling to run split-screen co-op at an acceptable performance standard.
An added complication is that Microsoft wants feature parity across the Series X and S versions of the games - so much so there's a suggestion Larian would not be able to release one Xbox version of Baldur's Gate 3 with split-screen co-op, and the other without it.
The last we heard from Larian was that it was working on it, and that it was weighing up some "compromises" - the suggestion being that split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S could, potentially, be removed. So when I spoke to Larian boss Swen Vincke about this last week, I asked whether a decision had yet been made.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly "leaning toward" an appeal of yesterday's decisive court verdict that cleared the way for Microsoft to complete its Activision Blizzard acquisition in the US.


A Bloomberg report states that the FTC currently favours launching an appeal, but has just days to do so.


Microsoft cannot close the deal in the US before Friday this week, while the deal itself is set to expire next Tuesday, 18th July. It's therefore expected Microsoft will act swiftly, and seek to complete the acquisition once and for all this coming Monday.

That's according to reliable Assassin's Creed fan resource Access The Animus, which spotted the post. Tellingly, said post has subsequently been edited to remove "for 2024" - and now simply describes the game as "the biggest blockbuster".

A Borderlands movie was first announced back in 2015, but it wasn't until five years later, when Gearbox announced Hostel director Eli Roth would be directing from a script by Mazin, that the project finally appeared to be moving forward in earnest.


Things progressed quickly after Roth and Mazin's involvement was confirmed, with a succession of major acting talent - including the likes Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jack Black - all signing up to join the star-studded cast prior to the start of shooting in 2021.

Things kick off with The Making of Karateka, a historical delve into Mechner's noted martial arts game that'll combine interviews, video, design documents, audio, and photos to create what the studio is calling the "deepest, most exhaustive exploration of the making of a single video game that's ever been attempted in a video game itself."


"In The Making of Karateka," the studio explains on Xbox Wire, "you'll meet Jordan Mechner - not the legendary veteran game designer we know today, but the unknown teenage college student who was desperate to break into the video game business. Through excerpts from his college journals, galleries of his design documents, and all-new video interviews, you'll share Jordan’s struggles and triumphs as he creates a video game like no one had ever seen before."

Axiom Verge 2 builds on its 2015 predecessor's exploratory action with a quest to "discover the origins of the Axiom Verge universe", beginning as new protagonist (and billionaire owner of the Globe 3 conglomerate) Indra heads to Antarctica in search of her daughter.


Here, Indra discovers a portal to an entirely different reality - a ruined Earth-like world infected by parasitic machines - that she'll need to explore and overcome, battling deadly monsters along the way with her melee-focused abilities if she wants to survive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[West of Dead studio Upstream Arcade and publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment have given a first proper taste of Hellboy Web of Wyrd's gameplay in a brisk new trailer as the "roguelite action brawler" continues its journey toward a release on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.


Hellboy Web of Wyrd was formally announced last December, teasing an original storyline crafted in collaboration with series creator Mike Mignola, as well as a striking aesthetic designed to evoke the visuals and atmosphere of the comics.


While specifics still remain relatively sparse some six months on, we do known it'll take place in The Butterfly House, a strange residence built upon "occult ley-energies" whose many doorways lead to a "terrible and fascinating" dimension known as The Wyrd.

Last week's courtroom battle hinged on whether the FTC could be allowed an injunction to temporarily block the deal while it investigated further. But in reality the case was viewed as a referendum on the deal's overall ability to still be successful.
Defeat in court would have left Microsoft's effort to buy the publisher behind World of Warcraft, Diablo 4 and Candy Crush dead in the water, Microsoft had previously admitted.

Twitch created a team of LGBT+ streamers from the UK and Ireland who were added to a specific Pride Month "shelf" on the front page during the month of June, though this was located beneath other recommendation feeds and lacked promotion on social media.


Speaking to Eurogamer at TwitchCon Paris, members of this team stated it wasn't beneficial and would like to see Twitch improve its support for LGBT+ streamers not just during Pride Month but throughout the year.

The remaining 13 percent can be easily accessed - whether that's through a re-release on modern platforms or through an officially provided emulation service, but the majority of older games remain unavailable through easy means.

The study was produced in order to substantiate the amount of video game history in danger of being lost, the Video Game History Foundation said, and provide evidence on why libraries and archives should be allowed to preserve games in a similar way to other media forms such as books and films.

A "supermajority" of 144 employees spread across marketing, localisation, product development, and quality assurance at Sega of America revealed its intention to unionise back in April, with the aim of securing higher base pay, improving benefits, and more.


At the time, the group confirmed it had contacted the National Labor Relations Board in order to file for an election, to which Sega management were said to be "investigating and considering the options available". That election has now taken place, with 91 employees voting yes and 26 voting no out of 200+ eligible employees.

Call of Duty's The Boys collaboration was first teased via a telltale bit of graffiti during a Summer Game Fest trailer for Modern Warfare 2's new 6v6 Vondel Waterfront map - also arriving as part of Season 4 Reloaded - but it's now been made official, with Activision confirming three The Boys characters will join the action via new Operator bundles.


Starlight, Homelander (who's also rumoured to be making the jump to NetherRealm's Mortal Kombat 1), and Black Noir are all set to recieve Operator bundles as part of Season 4 Reloaded - arriving on 12th, 16th, and 20th July respectively - each costing 2,400 COD Points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're just a couple of weeks away from the launch of Peacock's Twisted Metal television show, and, with the publicity machine now in full swing, we've been given our best look yet at the vehicular combat series' live-action adaptation, courtesy of a new two-minute trailer.


This isn't our first glimpse at the Twisted Metal TV series, of course; April offered a brisk introduction to Anthony Mackie's "motor-mouthed outsider" protagonist and the tiniest tease of iconic villain Sweet Tooth (voiced by Will Arnett and played by Samoa Joe), while June showed the pair exchanging quips and violence in a follow-up clip.


And now, with launch day in sight, Peacock has released a considerably more wide-ranging looking at the action fans can expect. There are cars! Guns! Cars being shot at with guns in a shopping mall! We get a peek at post-apocalyptic San Francisco, and the rather more gnarly post-apocalypse beyond the city's walls, plus a look at Neve Campbell as Raven and Thomas Haden Church in the role of Agent Stone.

But much more importantly than that, the publisher also unveiled its first bit of cover art for the game - this one being for the premium-priced Ultimate Edition, with the standard one still to come - and it is... quite odd?
Player faces have always occupied a strangely prominent spot in FIFA fans' minds, often being one of the first things referred to when comparing differences between the latest version from EA and Konami's rival series eFootball (formerly PES).

Moore said he has "always" described Clockwork Revolution as a mix of the two, due to its "deep world building, compelling narrative, crunchy RPG systems, engaging gameplay, and massive reactivity," on Twitter.

Moore's credits include both Arcanum and Bloodlines, as he was a lead artist and designer at developer Troika Games from 1999 to 2004. On his website, Moore states he was involved in narrative, content, and character design for both games.

BBC NI reported "an image of a partially undressed woman appeared on screen for several seconds before being removed". The BBC also reported that parents of the children who attended were informed of the incident by organisers.

Eiding, who also voices characters in the Fallout series and Shin Megami Tensei 5, to name but a few, said that if someone does not have written permission to use his voice, then they "DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION". This, the actor stated, included any AI voice lines generated using his voice data.

That's according to Larian's Nick Pechenin, who confirmed in a recent livestream that as well as bumping into a character who "will allow you to reset your class, and reinvest all of your levels", players can also explore some "really cool" multiclass combinations.

"We wanted to avoid players having to restart the whole game, because it's a very heavy narrative experience," Pechenin said (thanks, PC Gamer). "There's a character you might meet – you will most likely meet – that will allow you reset your class, and reinvest all of the levels."

In an all-new developer diary posted to YouTube (see below), Bokeh revealed new details about its inaugural title, including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities, and – surprise! – the ability to play as a dog.

Given "early development footage" is stamped across all snippets of gameplay and most of the action comes from early tests, it's safe to presume that development has moved on since this footage was captured, but nonetheless, it provides a tantalising glimpse at what's in store.

<blockquote><p>A mysterious squid-like cosmic cloud, this nebula is very faint, but also very large in planet Earth&#8217;s sky. In the image, composed with 30 hours of narrowband image data, it spans nearly three full moons toward the royal constellation Cepheus. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula&#8217;s bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue-green emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, a more recent investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Larian confirmed this to me at an event I went to this week, where I played the launch version of the game.


Orin the Red, as the character is known, is a magical, shape-shifting menace. A sexy but sadistic presence who will appear time and time again through the game - towards the latter parts of it - to test your resolve.

The video is a short primer on what the titular Pikmin are and how they can be used in-game. The overview follows a new traveller as they meet the Pikmin and learn how to work with them.

The traveller looks on in confusion at various points, before a Pikmin confidently approaches them and instructs them to blow their whistle, or launch it towards a task to do, which got a chuckle out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yuji Naka, Sonic's co-creator and the man behind ill-fated platformer Balan Wonderworld, has been found guilty of insider trading, but will avoid prison for now.


Naka was first arrested back in November 2022 following reports of alleged insider trading at Square Enix. He pleaded guilty in March, and then, in June, the developer was sentenced to serve two and a half years in jail, with a final judgement in July.


At this time, Naka was additionally fined twice for ¥2.5m and ¥170m (just under £1m total), with his defence seeking a suspended sentence and to lower the fines. They claimed Naka "accidentally saw information that was extremely unrelated to [his] work". However, prosecutors said Naka "showed no signs of remorse" for his actions.

Known as Season of the Malignant, this season will introduce the fittingly named Malignant Monsters. These monsters are described by Blizzard as "decaying abominations" that roam through Sanctuary in a frenzy. They will not hesitate to attack anyone or anything that gets in their way. 


A new questline will focus on sorting these new foes out, with Cormond, a former priest of the Cathedral of Light, helping you on your way. He will train you to "capture the Malignant hearts" that are the source of the monsters' power, and "convert them into build-altering powers".

Not including today's announcements, NetherRealm has so-far confirmed a total of 10 playable characters for Mortal Kombat 1: Johnny Cage, Kenshi, Kitana, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Mileena, Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung (available via pre-order), and Sub-Zero.


Two more additions have now been revealed as part of NetherRealm's latest Kombat Kast livestream. Assassin-turned-cyborg Smoke is in, marking his first playable appearance in the main series since 2011's Mortal Kombat reboot. He's joined by moody demi-god Rain, who hasn't been benched quite so long, having appeared in Mortal Kombat 11 as a DLC character.

Speaking to GameReactor at the recent Gamelab conference in Barcelona, Molyneux was reluctant to give many firm details of the game or this idea to avoid - in his words - people subsequently getting "very annoyed and angry" when their expectations of Molyneux's words are met with reality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashback, the classic 16-bit sci-fi platformer from Delphine Software, is, as you probably already know, getting a sequel before the end of 2023, some 31 years after its original release. And new developer Microids has now offered a fresh look at Flashback 2's action - specifically the jungle-y bits - in a new trailer as it prepares for a November release.


The original Flashback, which arrived to much acclaim back in 1992 - when everything was still in black and white, and computers were powered by magic - followed the far-flung future adventures of agent Conrad B. Hart on the trail of shapeshifting aliens attempting to infiltrate human society. It was an investigation that, much like Delphine's earlier Another World, took the form of a strikingly rotoscoped platform-puzzler.


Flashback 2 (which, somewhat confusingly, isn't technically the game's first sequel, given the existence of 1995's 3D follow-up Fade to Black) sees Conrad B. Hart return for more sci-fi adventure - somewhere in the 22nd century - as he goes in search of his friend Ian. Again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friday the 13th: The Game's days are regrettably numbered, but developer Gun Interactive is bidding it farewell in something like celebratory style, bestowing maximum power on all players for their maximum enjoyment (but also to alleviate some pressure on servers) as the game's doomsday clock ticks down toward its closure at the end of next year.


Gun announced an end for Friday the 13th: The Game back in June, confirming the asymmetrical multiplayer horror would be pulled from stores on 31st December this year, the same day its Friday the 13th licence officially expires. There's some small solace for owners, however, in that the studio has promised the game will remain playable through "at least" 31st December 2024.


And now, it's announced some new measures that, while primarily designed to "reduce the dependence on database servers", will also allow players to go about their merry slaughtering and killer-evading survival in chaotically maxed-out fashion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's all change this year in the world of video game football, as EA - after some seriously big-money tussling - readies what will be its first major football game not to carry the FIFA branding in nearly 30 years. And now, thanks to a new leak, we've got a good idea of when EA Sports FC will likley be showing up - which, unsurprisingly, is pretty much slap bang in the same late-September slot FIFA has occupied for the last few years.


According to data miner billbil-kun - who has a amassed a pretty compelling back catalogue of accurate calls when it comes to video game leaks (Sony's monthly PlayStation Plus line-up being a particular specialty) - EA Sports FC will release on 29th September this year.


Given that FIFA 2023 and the series entry before it both launched on 27th September in their respective release years, it's hardly a huge surprise to learn EA's new FIFA-in-all-but-name game will follow suit, but it does give us an intriguing window to watch as we prepare to see how EA Sports FC will fair without its familiar branding.

This option appears to be an alternative to the more involved Discovery Tour mode that popped up some time post-launch in Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. Perhaps befitting Mirage's more condensed nature, this option too sounds less involved.


Appropriately titled the "History of Baghdad", the option is described as being similar to the series' traditional Codex, and has been built in partnership with a series of museums and international historical institutions.

Speaking out just a couple of weeks after the origins of Destiny's space golf ball The Traveller were finally revealed - to a somewhat mixed response - Bungie staff have defended Destiny's storytelling techniques, and said players should not expect to make allies with the game's villainous Hive.


"The Hive has still committed a lot of, you know, genocide," senior narrative designer Robert Brookes told Dexerto, pouring cold water on the Guardians and the Hive suddenly becoming besties.

Yes, that's right. If you head over to the eShop right now, you can get your hands on The Last Hope - Dead Zone Survival, an "intense storyline game set in an apocalyptic world overrun by hordes of ravenous zombies". Launched on 30th June, it normally costs £8.99 but is currently on sale for just 99p. 


Having played The Last Hope myself, I would advise saving your pennies for something more worthwhile. Toothpicks, perhaps. You can see a trailer for The Last Hope below (and if you were still interested in playing the game afterwards, please note there are spoilers for The Last Hope below).

The methods previously reported on Eurogamer, one using thrown weapons and another using frozen meat, now do not work in version 1.2.0 of the game. I've tested this myself, and am grateful I already cashed in 40k before I updated my version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Diablo 4 player has found what appeared to be - initially at least - a giant version of the game's terrifying Butcher enemy.


The Butcher, an infamous enemy from the first game, can randomly spawn in any dungeon, at any level, and is a particularly nasty foe to defeat.


Reddit user IronHeart_777 discovered a giant "beast of a Butcher" while running nightmare dungeons with friends, but don't worry - it's not actually a new version of the enemy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Wildcard's less-than-elegant rollout of Ark: Survival Ascended, a full-price remaster of its 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved, continues with the news of a delay from August to October this year, and word it'll now launch without its first bit of remastered DLC.


Ark: Survival Ascended has already had a bumpy start to life; the remaster first surfaced when Studio Wildcard announced it'd be taking Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers offline later this year, and that the only way to continue using official servers would be to purchase its new Unreal Engine 5 remaster - only available as part of a bundle with the now-delayed Ark 2. Following an outcry from players, Studio Wildcard eventually announced it would scrap the bundle, instead replacing it with a standalone version of Ark: Survival Ascended that was - amazingly - exactly the same price, despite featuring one less game.


It's in this context that Studio Wildcard has now announced a delay for Ascended, saying it has "found it challenging working with Unreal Engine 5.2".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a court filing submitted as part of its legal battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed Activision Blizzard aquisition, Microsoft has claimed Sony is "expected to release" both a PlayStation 5 Slim and a "handheld version of the PS5" before the end of this year.


Both machines were referenced during a paragraph (as spotted by IGN) intended to demonstrate that Nintendo's Switch should not - as the FTC is arguing - be considered in a separate market to Xbox and PlayStation based on price. It's a point Microsoft is determined to prove so it can more effectively assert its stated position as the underdog in the console market.


As part of its argument, Microsoft notes the Xbox Series S is $50 cheaper than Switch's OLED model in the US, with the $399.99 PS5 Digital Edition being just $50 more. It's here the company first makes reference to an unannounced Sony machine, claiming the latter is "expected to release a PlayStation 5 Slim later this year at the same reduced price point."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games, Apple has submitted a filing requesting the Supreme Court overthrows a 2021 ruling made by the US district court of California, which upheld a complaint against Apple's anti-steering practices.


Epic launched its lawsuit against Apple in August 2020, following the iPhone maker's decision to revoke Epic's Fortnite developer account, preventing the battle royale game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees.


As that case reached its conclusion, California's Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in all but one of its 10 claims. However, the one ruling made in Epic's favour - that Apple cannot block developers from linking out to alternative payment methods from within their apps (a practice known as "anti-steering") - has remained a sticking point for the company.

The tech giant had previously set a target of 1m units sold in 2024, but there are now concerns it won't be able to produce enough devices.


What's more, as reported by the FT (thanks IGN), current production issues have pushed back plans for a cheaper version of the $3499 headset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Have you ever been on a crowded train with one of your best gay friends and, inside, a tiny part of you is cringing because he is being so gay?"
That's a question posed by my favourite drag queen and Ireland's self-proclaimed gender discombobulator, Panti Bliss, in a biting speech about "checking" herself. What she's "checking" is something most queer people "check" for in public, whether they realise it or not: their own queerness. Am I standing too gay? What about these colourful socks? Are they too much? Will holding a partner's arm in public turn into a problem? Something private and intimate altered into something shameful or political, all through other people's reactions. 


That feeling's best thought of as the tension between who people expect us to be and who we really are... or who we're trying to become. Imagined futures are projected onto our bodies like film reels, blurring the skin that lies beneath. That tension feels a lot like shame. But, while video games usually have all the subtlety of a sledgehammer busting through a wall, they're occasionally a great place to explore queer topics, letting us role-play as whoever we want to be or explore those unique experiences in unique ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has cancelled development of its long-in-the-works Just Cause mobile game, which had been available in regional early access - but never fully launched - since November 2021.


Just Cause: Mobile was unveiled in December 2020, during The Game Awards, where it was billed as a free-to-play action shooter set in the Just Cause universe, featuring single-player, four-player co-op, and 30-person competitive multiplayer modes.


It was originally set to launch in 2021, and, did, eventually get a release in Singapore - albeit only as regional early access title - before the year was through. Since then, Just Cause: Mobile's early access has spread to a number of other countries but development has been repeatedly hit by delays, culminating in an indefinite delay toward the end of last year and, in February, the termination of all regional early access programmes.

The developer was given a second chance to resubmit their game but said, via Reddit, that this was also rejected - due to them not owning the necessary rights. 


Now, in a statement provided to Eurogamer, Valve has clarified a few points on this post, and provided further insight into how it will police AI-generated content on Steam in general.

A fresh rating for Red Dead Redemption via the leaky Korean Ratings Board popped up last week, setting tongues wagging that Rockstar had quietly submitted a fresh version of its cowboy classic to be approved for release.

Entitled "Far Cry 1.34 Complete", the game's entire source code was uploaded to the internet archive site Archive.org at the end of June by a user called Llaetha.ro, and has since been shared across Reddit and social media.

It's unclear if the code includes any subsequent patches – although the .34 part of the 1.34 title certainly suggests so – and some commenters who've presumably downloaded and run the code believe the code is "not complete, but close".

As spotted by Dexerto (via PC Gamer), the bans come after gambling site CSGOEmpire published a spreadsheet of CS:GO traders it believed were part of a cryptocurrency money laundering scheme allegedly operating through a rival gambling site called CSGORoll. 

Whilst Valve has yet to comment on whether or not the bans were connected to the details revealed in the spreadsheet, it seems as though all but one of the accounts leaked on the spreadsheet have now been banned.

Last week, Diablo 4's lead class designer, Adam Jackson, jumped online to "clear up" the confusion around some of Diable 4's rarest unique items, and it's from Jackson that we learned the names of the six rarest ones: Andariel's Visage, Doombringer, Harlequin Crest, Melted Heart of Selig, Ring of Starless Skies, and The Grandfather.

Up until that point, some extraordinarily lucky players had discovered five of the six items, but the most elusive one, Melted Heart of Selig, was still the stuff of legend… until yesterday, it seems, when the item finally dropped for a Chinese necromancer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new "stylish, story-driven" adventure-stroke-dating game Thirsty Suitors has a release date: 2nd November.

Described as a "game about culture, relationships, family pressures, and expressing oneself", Thirsty Suitors sees you help Jala "handle her demanding parents, reconcile with her exes, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister’s wedding".

"Can Jala learn to love herself and heal the wounds of her past?" the video description teases, before giving us a two-minute peek at Jala's hectic world and family life, reminding some in the comments of Edgar Wright's film adaptation of Scott Pilgrim vs The World.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the second instalment of Toby Fox's reportedly seven-part "nonviolent" RPG Deltarune steadily approaching its second anniversary, fans are understandably eager to hear when more will be on the way, and while Fox mightn't be ready to divulge that particularly bit of information yet, he has now offered a development update.


Deltarune - which charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World - launched its first chapter toward the end of 2018 as a free download. A second instalment - also free - arrived in September 2021, followed by the news a third, fourth and fifth chapter will all launch simultaneously at a later date.


The big question for Deltarune fans, though, is when, and the answer, if Fox's latest progress report is anything to go by, still sounds very much like 'not any time soon'. Fox does reveal, however, the team is currently working on Chapter 3's last overworld area - and once that's done, "the chapter will finally be playable all the way through".

News that Ubisoft has finally decided to give everyone what they more or less wanted in the first place comes via Kotaku, which claims, citing two sources familiar with the publisher's plans, that the remake is "still in its earliest stages".


Ubisoft Singapore - the same studio still trying to finish the embattled Skull and Bones - is "heavily involved" with the project, which isn't expected to complete "for at least a few years".

        <updated>2023-06-30T18:19:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment, the company behind this year's critically lambasted The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, is reportedly set to exit game development and has laid off around 25 employees as part of the move. Additionally, a second Lord of the Rings game in development at the studio is said to have been cancelled.


Daedalic's The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was announced in 2019 for release in 2021, finally arrived last month, following numerous setbacks and delays. Its reception was less-than-positive, however, with Eurogamer's Christian Donlan calling it a "well-intentioned mess" in his 1 out of 5 review. It was something of a surprise, then, when reports surfaced soon after that Daedalic was currently working on a second Lord of the Rings game.


According to German website Games Wirtschaft, however, that game - which has reportedly been in the works since mid-2022 - is no more, with development now cancelled as part of Daedalic's sudden decision to shift away from development and solely into publishing following Gollum's poor reception.

The court case between Microsoft and the FTC came to a close yesterday, after several days of testimonies, revelations and Sharpie-related blunders. 


During the proceedings, Microsoft's lawyer took to the floor in a bid to clear up a bit of a misunderstanding surrounding Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. However, in doing so, they perhaps made things a touch more confusing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has once again addressed the Xbox version of its upcoming RPG Baldur's Gate 3, confirming that while it's still in the work, the developer may ultimately be forced to make "compromises" in order to release on the platform.


Larian's struggles with Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox first surfaced in February, when - amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive - the studio confirmed it was working on an Xbox version but that it had "run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op."


In a statement provided to Digital Foundry shortly after, Larian explained its decision not to formally announced an Xbox release was more specifically down to issues it was having getting "split-screen co-op to work to the same standard on both Xbox Series X and S". And now, in an interview with IGN, studio founder and creative director Swen Vincke has shared more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were first introduced to Pioneers of Pagonia, a new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich, earlier this year, there wasn't much to go on beyond a brief description and a teaser video. Now, though, with its early access release steadily drawing nearer, we've been given a first proper look at the thing via a new in-game trailer.


Pioneers of Pagonia, to get the fundamentals out the way, sets players loose on the titular (and procedurally generated) islands of Pagonia with the goal of establishing a presence through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover - and the alliances they forge with Pagonia's not always friendly inhabitants - along the way.


40 different building types have also been promised for Pioneers of Pagonia's Steam early access launch, along with more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. A co-op mode is also planned, meaning you'll be able to be a ruinous blight on the land (or otherwise, I suppose) with a friend in tow.

RoboCop: Rogue City - which is build around an "original story" set between RoboCop 2 and 3 - looks to land somewhere between a first-person shooter and cybernetically enhanced detective adventure, whisking players to the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit to solve crimes, slay baddies, and perhaps even turn a few wrong 'uns into goo.


"Explore open areas and complete your objectives according to your own sense of justice," explains Teyon. "Finding evidence, interrogation and maintaining public order are just some of your daily tasks as a police officer. But don't take decisions lightly: your choices can determine the fate of citizens and the result of your mission."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when it looked like we might be done with the showcases for the summer, here comes another one, this time from the ever-reliable Annapurna Interactive. And it was a typically strong showing for the publisher, offering a fresh look at some already announced titles - including the new one from Sayonara Wild Hearts' studio Simogo and the fascinating Cocoon - as well as some big reveals. From stunning photographic adventures to an honest-to-goodness new Blade Runner game, there's a lot to look forward to in the months and year ahead, and a full round-up of the showcase can be found below.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes

Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo's latest is a baroque blend of surreal mystery thriller and puzzle adenture, faintly bringing to mind the studio's iOS classic Device 6. It focuses on a woman's search for answers, deep in a strange manor house, as players attempt to solve the enigma at its heart. There's no release date yet, but we do it's coming to Switch and Steam - and while we await further details, there's a tantilising new trailer above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Microsoft argues with the Federal Trade Commission in the US over its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Canada moved to refute the Xbox maker's claims that, the FTC excluded, "all but one" regulator around the world is onboard with its deal - noting that Canada is still 'monitoring the transaction'.


As reported by The Verge, Canada's Competition Bureau has written to Judge Corley, who is currently presiding over the FTC's Activision Blizzard case in the US, to correct certain "factual inaccuracies" in Microsoft's court filings.


Microsoft had told the court that "every single worldwide regulator that has examined the deal other than the FTC has rejected" the theory it would remove Call of Duty from PlayStation should the acquisition go through, and that all regulators agreed "withholding COD from Sony would be unprofitable and is thus not a serious concern." It also claimed "all but one foreign regulator" (namely the UK's CMA) had cleared the transaction.

The company will close its recently-released NBA All-World game, end development of its upcoming Marvel World of Heroes project, and shut down its Los Angeles development studio. The news was communicated to staff via an email from company founder John Hanke, which has now been made public.


Pokémon Go, which remains lucrative, is safe. Indeed, Hanke calls it the company's "top priority" as it slims down and refocuses on the future.

A big draw this month is Darkwood, the nightmarish survival horror game from Acid Wizard Studio, which will be available between 1st July until 31st July.

Darkwood, which originally released on PC in 2017, is a frightening horror experience that combines exploration, combat, scavenging, crafting and survival into an extremely unusual whole. Our Donlan called it "a masterclass in how to undermine the audience in tiny, gnat-bite ways" when he played it back in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we look back at a week of headlines from Microsoft's time in court arguing its case to buy Activision Blizzard with the FTC.

In the video game industry, courtroom drama does not get much bigger than this. Microsoft's Phil Spencer and Satya Nadella, Sony's Jim Ryan and Activision boss Bobby Kotick have all given evidence as the US weighs up whether to allow Xbox's enormous Call of Duty buyout to procede.
The week has brought us some eye-opening opinions from these top industry execs, as well as a treasure trove of emails to pore through - and some badly-redacted documentation. Today, we recap the biggest stories of the week, including who else was on Microsoft's studio shopping list, and why Bethesda is upset at Call of Duty not being platform exclusive. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4's time rewind feature is a big addition to the series, though I admit being apprehensive at first around how it might be deployed. After a week with the game - and you can read some of my early thoughts here - I've come to use it sparingly, but appreciate its existence.


As its name suggests, the feature allows you to skip backwards and undo any sudden calamity. Though in doing so, my initial fear was it risked devaluing the Pikmin series' usual high stakes.


After all, the frequent likelihood of imminent Pikmin death - their agonising squeals, the sad sight of their soul floating slowly upwards - acts to ensure you approach each situation with care.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, many claims and discoveries flying around in the wake of Microsoft's ongoing FTC lawsuit over the attempted purchase of Activision Blizzard, one particular quote stands out: PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's accusation that Xbox Game Pass and other subscription-based services are "value destructive" to video games.
Ryan, speaking in pre-recorded video testimony, also claimed other publishers "unanimously do not like Game Pass" for that reason. When pressed by Microsoft's lawyer, he added: "I talk to publishers all the time, and this is a very commonly-held view over many years by the publishers."
Talking to Eurogamer yesterday, Miles Jacobson, studio head of Sports Interactive, the Sega-owned developer of the ever-popular Football Manager series, disagreed with that quite directly.

Meanwhile, the game's PlayStation 5 version will launch slightly later - directly up against Starfield on 6th September. 


Discussing this release reshuffle, Larian Studios exec Michael Douse explained that while the PC version was ready to go, the PS5 edition needed slightly more time, and it did not make sense to delay the former just to release at he same time as the latter.

As part of the ongoing Microsoft vs FTC court case, Sony provided documentation detailing confidential information about its PlayStation business. As is custom, key details in this documentation were redacted. At least, they were meant to be. 


Thanks to the retrospectively poor choice of using a Sharpie marker to redact the key information, it's easy to see the contents of these redactions now the document has been scanned.

The Kubernetes community has been signing their container image-based artifacts
since release v1.24. While the graduation of the corresponding enhancement
from alpha to beta in v1.26 introduced signatures for the binary artifacts,
other projects followed the approach by providing image signatures for their
releases, too. This means that they either create the signatures within their
own CI/CD pipelines, for example by using GitHub actions, or rely on the
Kubernetes image promotion process to automatically sign the images by
proposing pull requests to the k/k8s.io repository. A requirement for
using this process is that the project is part of the kubernetes or
kubernetes-sigs GitHub organization, so that they can utilize the community
infrastructure for pushing images…]]></summary>

The Cycle: Frontier, which arrived on PC last June, sees teams of players - in the role of Prospectors - airdropping onto a hostile alien planet in order to gather resources, fend off predators and competing teams with a steadily expanding arsenal, then whizz back into space at the end with all their hard-earned spoils.


The game has seen three seasons of updates since its launch last summer, but Yager has now announced development is coming to an end, with its most recent patch being its last.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of Microsoft's court battle with US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission, emails between Xbox boss Phil Spencer and PlayStation head Jim Ryan have been revealed, outlining Microsoft's initial proposal to Sony - regarding the Activision Blizzard games it would be willing to keep on the PlayStation platform should its $69bn acquisition be approved - and Ryan's lengthy counter-proposal.


As confirmed by Phil Spencer last September, Microsoft contacted Sony shortly after the January announcement of its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, providing a signed agreement to Sony guaranteeing Call of Duty would remain on PlayStation - with feature and content parity - for "at least several more years beyond" Sony current contract.


During his FTC deposition this week, Ryan admitted he "wasn't particularly" happy with Microsoft's original proposal, but "hoped it was an opening salvo" - and we now have a more precise picture of his initial response, thanks to newly revealed emails, as spotted by The Verge's Tom Warren. In a reply dated 26th May, Ryan informed Spencer that Microsoft's proposal "did not fulfil" the objective of "ensuring Activision Blizzard games are available on PlayStation", and that the company had "serious concerns" which an enclosed counter-proposal from Sony was intended to address.

The change went live earlier this week and was praised by players. But, last night, Niantic announced via Twitter that the buff would be removed. 


Adding to the confusion is the fact that the game's community leaders - who are regularly fed information by Niantic - were allegedly told the game was working "as intended" with the spawn change applied.

Writing on the BioWare website, McKay explained that "most of the current team will be invited to accompany" Star Wars: The Old Republic as its development switches over to Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot studio Broadsword Online Games - a move EA previously said was necessary so BioWare could focus on its new Mass Effect and Dragon Age titles.


"Unfortunately," McKay continued, "not every role will make the move. This is the hardest part of this transition, and these decisions were not made lightly."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 5 - or Project Rene, as EA is currently calling - is still some considerable way from release, but that isn't stopping developer Maxis from showing off its early experiments exploring what this "next generation" Sims game could be - and the studio has now shared a little more as part of its latest Sims stream.


When Project Rene was officially unveiled in October last year, EA teased a game built on a foundation of "charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories" that would be designed with real-time collaboration in mind (solo play is still supported) and be simultaneously playable across a range of devices, including mobile and PC.


At the time, footage was limited to some expanded creativity tools inspired by The Sims 3's Create a Style options, but Project Rene's latest airing in EA's new Behind the Sims showcase (which also had a lot to say about horses) has gone into a little more detail about what The Sims 5 might look like if Maxis' current experiments prove fruitful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has announced a new batch of titles heading to its Apple Arcade subscription service in July, including two particularly notable oldies-but-goodies: Stardew Valley and Slay the Spire, which both arrive in '+' form, denoting they were previously available on the iOS App Store.


Stardew Valley+, as if it needs an introduction, is developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's wildly popular spin on the farm life sim genre, having now sold over 20m copies since its launch in 2016. Apple Arcade subscribers will have the opportunity to succumb to its endearing blend of agricultural wealth accumulation and pixel wooing from 28th July.


As for Slay the Spire+, it's also a bit of a modern classic. Developer Mega Crit Games' roguelike deck-building dungeon-crawler - which sees players attempting to fend off monsters and scale the titular spire with nothing but a fist of battle-ready cards - is a wonderfully refined, richly rewarding experience, and well worth seeking out.

As reported by Variety, the new series - which is being handled by Big Mouth and Star: Trek Lower Decks animation studio Titmouse - looks to be adhering closely to the core murder-and-deduction premise of its video game source material.


The show's official longline reads, "Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone. Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Air Twister, the on-rails 3D shooter and Space Harrier spiritual successor from legendary Sega designer Yu Suzuki is heading to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 10th November this year.


Air Twister, which launched for Apple's Apple Arcade subscription service last June, sees players battling alien invaders through 12 stages - and across various modes including  Arcade, Turbo, and Boss Rush - to save a planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


The ensuing action is a bit Space Harrier and a bit Panzer Dragoon - at certain points players take to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and Yu Suzuki has previously said Air Twister was inspired by a fantasy shooting game he envisaged in the 80s, before pivoting toward Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

Much of developer Remedy's original pitch for the sequel eventually worked its way into Alan Wake's American Nightmare, the action-heavy 2012 standalone spinoff which, while not unanimously loved by critics, went on to be one of the cult hits of the old Xbox Live Arcade days.


Remedy has continued to work on ideas for a full sequel ever since, through the period where it released Quantum Break - the Xbox One exclusive that mixed time-bending action and shooting with live-action TV episodes - and then the fellow "Remedy connected universe" entry Control.

In particular, the game will include The Eye of the Wanderer, which will allow players to pin screenshots to the map to help with exploration.


"The genre is quite dependent on being able to 'take mental notes'; remembering and visualising things like blocked paths, or situations that need tools or powers that you don't have," said senior game designer Rémi Boutin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Hitman developer IO Interactive's upcoming online fantasy RPG will be an Xbox console exclusive.


Earlier this year, the Hitman developer announced it was working on a "bold" new franchise. Very little else was shared, other than a tease it would feel both familiar and "unlike anything" the studio had done before. No platforms, or even a project name, were announced at this time.


However, evidence submitted in the ongoing FTC vs Microsoft trial suggests this upcoming release - known (for now) as Project Dragon - will seemingly be an Xbox console exclusive.

Previously available on iPhone via Apple Arcade subscription (though now discontinued), this beefed-up version of Q-Games' side-scrolling beat 'em-up sees you playing as a team of robotic rubbish collectors.


You'll need to use a selection of smart robo-abilities to eliminate anyone in your way as you clean up the streets of Junktown - which, judging by its name, sounds like a big job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft had intended to "spend Sony out of business", Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty wrote in an email dated from 2019.


The email, sent to Xbox exec Tim Stuart, has publicly surfaced now during Microsoft's ongoing courtroom battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout. In it, Booty encourages Xbox to make further acquisitions to bolster Game Pass and compete with Sony.


"We (Microsoft) are in a very unique position to be able to go spend Sony out of business," Booty wrote, in reference to planned spending of spending $2-3bn in 2020 to avoid competitors getting ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's promise it would keep Call of Duty on rival console platforms after buying Activision Blizzard prompted concern within Bethesda at its highest levels, a newly-published email now shows. 


Bethesda marketing exec Pete Hines emailed bosses, including Todd Howard, to highlight the approach Microsoft was taking with Activision in order to court regulatory approval and note that it was "the opposite" of what Bethesda itself had just been "asked (told) to do" with its own games. 


The email, dated 2nd October last year, expresses concern that Bethesda would be publicly questioned on why games like Starfield are Xbox-only following Microsoft's acquisition, as opposed to future incarnations of Call of Duty after Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Microsoft's court battle with US antitrust agency the FTC rumbles on, more and more juicy snippets of behind-closed-doors business doings are beginning to surface via released internal documents, and today's minor revelation comes via the news that Microsoft reportedly gave serious consideration to buying Sega - and other companies including Bungie and IO Interactive - to help it accelerate Xbox Game Pass.


This little bit of what-might-have-been comes via internal Microsoft documents spotted by The Verge, beginning with an email from Xbox boss Phil Spencer to CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, requesting strategy approval to approach Sega Sammy about a potential acquisition of its Sega games division.


Spencer suggested Sega's "well-balanced portfolio of games across segments with global geographic appeal" would help Microsoft "accelerate Xbox Game Pass both on and off-console", and that Sega's "beloved IP" would be particularly effective in helping Games Pass reach new audiences in Asia, "where localised content is critical to success".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a VR fan and desperate for yet another subscription service to sign up to, you're in luck! Meta has announced - and launched - Meta Quest+, a new subscription package promising access to "the best titles" on its virtual reality platforms.


Meta Quest+ isn't quite the Game Pass or PlayStation Plus Extra-style smorgasbord you might be envisaging, however; instead, it'll give subscribers access to two "handpicked VR titles" each month from a selection of Quest's "biggest hits, hidden gems, and back-catalog classics".


Meta Quest+ is available to Quest 2 and Quest Pro users, and costs £7.99/$7.99 USD a month or £59.99/$59.99 annually - a savings of over 37%, Meta notes. Curious sorts can get their first month's subscription for £1/$1 as long as they sign up before 31st July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Closing in on four year since its announcement, Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot is still nowhere to be seen, and a new report claims a succession of unfortunate setbacks has lead to "little meaningful progress" on the project since its 2020 unveiling.


When Microsoft revealed its Perfect Dark reboot for Xbox during The Game Awards in December 2020, it confirmed the project was being developed by The Initiative, the Santa Monica-based studio founded by Crystal Dynamics veteran Darrell Gallagher.


Since then, sporadic reports have suggested something of a tumultuous journey for the project; Crystal Dynamics was brought in to assist The Initiative in September 2021, game director Dan Neuburger departed the studio in March last year, and an exodus of over 30 key staff was reported shortly after - causing head of Microsoft Studios Matt Booty to insist the game wasn't in trouble during a panel talk in September 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in May, from an FAQ provided by developer Remedy, Alan Wake 2 will only have a digital release when it launches on October 17th later this year, with "no plans" for a physical release on disc at the time.
This has naturally sparked some concern among certain fans, with digital-only downloads posing issues for both game preservation, as shown by the closure of the Nintendo 3DS eShop in March this year, as well as ownership rights, exemplified by the infamously de-listed survival horror spinoff PT.
Speaking to Eurogamer at Summer Games Fest earlier this month, Alan Wake 2's creative director Sam Lake and game director Kyle Rowley gave us a little more detail on the reasoning behind going digital-only, explaining that, actually, it was to allow Remedy more time to polish the game to an acceptable level - something publisher Epic Games had also been on board with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Yakuza Complete Series - which comprises of seven games from Yakuza 0 through to Yakuza 6: The Song of Life -  recently released on GOG. However, along with this release, changes have been made to the games' credits, with several former Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio staff members and entire support studios not being acknowledged for their work on the series.


As spotted by Timo653 over on Reddit, developers such as series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and producer Daisuke Sato - who both left Sega several years ago to form Nagoshi Studio, a subsidiary of NetEase Games - are no longer credited for their work on the games. 


Meanwhile, the entirety of Lab42 (which worked on 0 and Kiwami 1, helping to bring these games to PC) and QLOC (which worked on Kiwami 2 to 6) have also seen their credits removed.

"This patch adds a new boss battle along with a new cutscene to the end of the game, as well as drivable golf carts, a rifle which can be found in one of the caves, frogs that sit on lily pads and chirp, the ability to chop heads off dead animals and use them as wall decorations, a bunch of stone building improvements and lots more," the development team explains.

Born by way of an internet urban legend in 2009, Slender Man has popped up in many fan-made and indie horror games, but his most notable in-game appearances include Slender: The Eight Pages in 2012 and 2013's Slender: The Arrival before a highly-publicised stabbing incident and moral panic saw the fictional entity go dark for several years.

In a statement, the studio defined what it believed datamining to be – the practice of "extracting information from massive datasets" and "illegal infiltration of in-game code and databases in order to extract information that is intentionally hidden from users" – and said that "in-game accounts involved in datamining and/or sharing data originating from datamining" will be banned, and "further actions taken afterwards".

"Throughout the past few years, there was an increase of datamined information circling around various websites as well as accounts on social media," the team explains. "While some players believe that the developers of Escape from Tarkov are not sharing information about hidden changes of the game, we also would like to remind that any data retrieval without official permission is a direct breach of [...] the license agreement."

That's according to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who recently confirmed that the latest instalment of the highly-anticipated RPG series was still "five-plus years away".

As reported by Axios' Stephen Totilo – who had been live-tweeting the outcomes from day two of the US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)/Microsoft court case all yesterday – Spencer was "asked a lot" about how Microsoft decides platform exclusivity, with much of the questioning framed around Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax.

Oklahoma will be American Truck Simulator's 13th explorable state when it makes its eventual debut - it joins California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas - and promises a tour of "wonderful state parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends."


You can get a brief taste of the expansion's highways, byways, and sweeping vistas in SCS Software's newly released Oklahoma gameplay preview trailer below - which, as ever, is basically video game ASMR, so dim the lights, grab a pillow, and let your cares drift away amid the gentle murmur of digital wheels on digital tarmac.

Alan Wake memorably begins with a voiceover from the game's main character quoting King in a description of what nightmares really mean.


Speaking to Eurogamer, Remedy boss Sam Lake revealed he had "really, really, desperately wanted" to be able to open the game with a quote from King himself - whose style matches much of the spooky supernatural horror that follows.

A special birthday update for Sonic Frontiers has been on the cards for some time now, having been announced as part of an expansive post-launch support roadmap at the end of last year. Now, however, with Sonic's big day finally here, we've got a clearer idea of what it'll bring.


For starters, the ordinarily rather drab world of Sonic Frontiers gets a splash of birthday cheer, festooned with the likes of balloons, wrapping paper, and other decor. Additionally, there's a jaunty party hat outfit for Sonic so everyone can properly get in the mood.

Destiny 1, which launched almost nine years ago, introduced The Traveller as a mysterious dormant entity that previously held magical powers, as well as the ability to hold back the ominous-sounding Darkness. 


Where had it come from? What were the nature of its powers? Was the Traveller actually a bad guy? I remember wondering all of these things as I looked up at the orb from Destiny's first Tower hub.

Fans have since been concerned about the future of The Old Republic, but a new forum post from executive producer Keith Kanneg lays out the future of the game, and notes BioWare is currently helping with "planning for 2024 and 2025".

ORIGINAL STORY 10.11pm: Following the shock cancellation of this year's E3 back in March, new details shared by the Los Angeles City Tourism Department suggest the games industry trade show won't be making a comeback anytime soon, with shows scheduled for 2024 and 2025 now also seemingly cancelled.


As spotted by Restera, the Entertainment Software Association, which owns E3, had initially booked the Los Angeles Convention Centre for the weeks beginning 11th June 2024 and 3rd June 2025 - dates shared as part of a Los Angeles City Tourism Department report last October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why, it's horse, of course! As widely expected thanks to a few cheeky leaks earlier this week, The Sims 4 is ushering in a new age of the equine for its next paid expansion; Horse Ranch, as the release is known, arrives on 20th July for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


Horse Ranch's primary focus is Chestnut Ridge, a new rustic prairie world inspired by the American West. Here, players can live out an idyllic life - either in a traditional country cabin or in something with a few more mod cons - caring for mini goats, mini sheep, and, of course, horses, which can be rescued, bred, purchased, customised, and raised from foals.


Sims not afraid to get their hands dirty have plenty of options on the ranch, from mucking out horse beds to harvesting prairie grass for the animal feeder, and it's even possible to brew moonsh... sorry, Nectar, by smashing up fruit and veg then ageing the results on Nectar racks ready for sale. There's also sheep shearing, goat milking, and other animal interactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking during today's FTC hearing, Bethesda's Pete Hines has confirmed the company's upcoming Indiana Jones game will be exclusive to Xbox and PC, with the court being told a multi-console contract was amended following the company's acquisition by Microsoft.


Bethesda announced its Indiana Jones game back in January 2021, confirming it was being developed by Wolfenstein studio MachineGames. However, it failed to make mention of the platforms it would target, a notable omission at the time given Microsoft's then-impending $7.5bn USD acquisition of Bethesda and Zenimax.


Little has been heard of the game since that initial reveal, but it's now burst back into the spotlight in something of an unexpected way - during a witness testimony from Bethesda's head of global publishing Pete Hines, as part of US antitrust agency the FTC's court proceedings to secure an injunction to block Microsoft's $69bn Activision Blizzard deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just three years after its much-heralded arrival, Activision is pulling the plug on the original Call of Duty: Warzone. The free-to-play battle royale shooter set to go offline on 21st September.


Call of Duty: Warzone launched along Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2020, but was renamed Warzone Caldera after the arrival of its similarly styled successor, Warzone 2.0, last November.


Warzone Caldera has remained available in the months since then - meaning players have been able to continue using real-money purchases including skins and weapons unavailable in 2.0 - but now Activision has signalled the end is in sight for the original experience, warning that all progression, inventories, and online services will "expire" in September.

The Xbox maker is currently in court to defend its $69bn USD Activision Blizzard acquisition, which the FTC is fighting to block through an injunction ahead of its own internal deliberations.


As part of a (heavily redacted) court filing intended to supplement the five-day case, Microsoft has once again attempted to portray itself the underdog in the console market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss yesterday's Mario-packed Nintendo Direct and Microsoft's surprise price rises.

For Nintendo, yesterday's online extravaganza acted like a shot of adrenaline to Switch's aging heart. There had been questions around how much Nintendo might still have for Switch, post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Now we have answers - and a release schedule busier than either Microsoft or Sony's for the remainder of 2023. Switch 2 certainly now feels even longer away.
Microsoft, meanwhile, took advantage of the Elephant Mario in the room to announce it's long-suspected price rises for Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Series X. It was an oppurtune moment for Microsoft to deliver the bad news, with the value of Game Pass demonstrated last week at its well-receieved Xbox Game Showcase. Still, was it really necessary? Or could it just get away with it because PlayStation blinked first? Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

Like its predecessors, The Past Within delivers a deliciously surreal mix of casual point-and-click puzzling and room escape action, albeit this time given a devious co-operative twist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Action roguelike Midautumn is named after the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the most important events of the calendar for many countries in Asia. It's a celebration of the full moon, usually falling in September or October, though traditions vary between countries. For me, it's a time of year I'll always associate with the mooncakes my grandma shares with us. For Midautumn developer Sherveen Uduwana, it brings back memories of attending these festivals as a child, and the comfort of lanterns and fireworks floating in the dark night sky.


Available in demo form during LudoNarraCon last month, Midautumn's blend of thematic storytelling and action mechanics immediately caught my eye - as well as its name. Still, Uduwana is aware Midautumn's title - and the experiences within Asian diaspora communities that inspired him - won't immediately feel familiar to many others. "I think a lot of folks I was pitching it to were like, why is it called Midautumn?" Uduwana tells me, adding that he settled on the name very early on. "There's a specific type of person who, when they find out the game is called Midautumn, gets very excited."


Uduwana tried pitching the game in a traditional way to secure funding, but the culture gap - and then, more significantly, the pandemic and the wave of anti-Asian sentiment surrounding it - caused him to opt for a more indie development approach instead. "That galvanised me to just be like, I'm just gonna message people and we'll try and make it," he says. "I was tired of having to explain why people would relate to it, or why it would be something that would be exciting for folks. A lot of people in those positions of power are just not really tuned into those specific communities."

Current categories exist for All Ages, 9+ and 13+, and Roblox has traditionally been seen as a place popular for children to play. 


But Roblox's audience is growing older - a natural step as the game matures in age and retains players as it does so - and 38 percent of Roblox's most active users were 17 and older in 2022, Roblox has said, making it the game's fastest-growing age group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has said that Sony would no longer be able to share details of its upcoming console hardware with Call of Duty maker Activision, if Microsoft's proposed $68.7bn buyout was approved by regulators.


Speaking to the US Federal Trade Commission, which is currently involved in legal proceedings to block the deal, Ryan said Sony "simply could not run the risk of a company that was owned by a direct competitor having access to that information".


Ryan's comments date from April this year, when the FTC questioned the PlayStation CEO on statements submitted by Sony designed to give its perspective on the deal. Chief among those is the worry by Sony that its game development processes would be interrupted as it "could no longer share confidential details about its next console in development".

This Friday more specifically marks 32 years since Sonic's western debut on Sega Mega Drive, which technically (if I have my hedgehog lore right) means he'll be celebrating his 47th birthday given his age in the first game. So before his back gives out completely, Sega will presumably be keen to shove as many announcement out as possible.


Friday's Sonic Central, then, is promising a "sneak peek of some of our upcoming projects, partnerships, and events happening in 2023".

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The computer security research community regularly tackles ethical questions. The field of ethics / moral philosophy has for centuries considered what it means to be &#8220;morally good&#8221; or at least &#8220;morally allowed / acceptable.&#8221; Among philosophy&#8217;s contributions are (1) frameworks for evaluating the morality of actions&#8212;including the well-established consequentialist and deontological frameworks&#8212;and (2) scenarios (like trolley problems) featuring moral dilemmas that can facilitate discussion about and intellectual inquiry into different perspectives on moral reasoning and decision-making. In a classic trolley problem, consequentialist and deontological analyses may render different opinions. In this research, we explicitly make and explore connections between moral questions in computer security research and ethics / moral philosophy through the creation and analysis of trolley problem-like computer security-themed moral dilemmas and, in doing so, we seek to contribute to conversations among security researchers about the morality of security research-related decisions. We explicitly do not seek to define what is morally right or wrong, nor do we argue for one framework over another. Indeed, the consequentialist and deontological frameworks that we center, in addition to coming to different conclusions for our scenarios, have significant limitations. Instead, by offering our scenarios and by comparing two different approaches to ethics, we strive to contribute to how the computer security research field considers and converses about ethical questions, especially when there are different perspectives on what is morally right or acceptable. Our vision is for this work to be broadly useful to the computer security community, including to researchers as they embark on (or choose not to embark on), conduct, and write about their research, to program committees as they evaluate submissions, and to educators as they teach about computer security and ethics...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

But after today's Nintendo Direct we have a much clearer picture of what's still to come, with a look at Pikmin 4 headlining the showcase, plus reveals of a Super Mario RPG remake and a brand new 2D Mario game.


First, though, Nintendo showed a fresh look at the forthcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC heading to Switch later this year.

Wave five will arrive this summer, complete with a new course known as Squeaky Clean Sprint. 


From what we can see in the trailer, this course looks to be taking us around a sud-filled bathroom, with plenty of bubbles and bottles to negotiate. It will be joined by another seven courses, which are yet to be announced.

At first glance, Super Mario Bros. Wonder's presentation is all very New Super Mario, with its crisp, clean lines - albeit this time slightly stylised - and familiar Mario motifs. But then, midway through its announcement trailer, Mario encounters a new power-up and things get weird.


Warp pipes come alive in wiggly choreography, heaving and bending all over the place; spherical cows come tumbling in; Mario - and the world around him - gets a new stretchy, silhouetted look, and here come mega-herds of adorable sheep!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI is a hot topic of discussion across the video game industry right now. Several developers have flirted with this new technology, with the likes of Ubisoft announcing its Ghostwriter AI tool earlier this year. Meanwhile, the High on Life team used AI to create video game voice dialogue.


Last week, I had the opportunity to chat with voice actors Jennifer Hale and David Hayter about their upcoming release, Synapse, and during this conversation, the topic of AI came up.

The first Pikmin introduced the world to Captain Olimar and his titular half-plant, half-animal pals back on GameCube in 2001. A sequel followed in 2004, expanding on the original's real-time strategy style puzzling with new Pikmin, cave exploration, and more.


Since then, both titles have received gentle updates for Wii, introducing a pointer-style control system. However, it's not entirely clear which editions of Pikmin 1 & 2 are coming to Switch, with Nintendo only referring to them as "HD versions".

Details are still incredibly sparse. The short teaser showed the platform's Princess Toadstool making her way along a rather fairytale-looking street set on a theatre stage. Then she made a tree burst into bloom to open a door, all thanks to a nifty use of magic. 


She then magically changed from her standard pink dress into something a little more dazzling, and the trailer ends.

A sequel to Detective Pikachu's original 2019 3DS adventure was announced that same year, but The Pokémon Company has shared little about the project in the years since.


Now, though, Detective Pikachu has resurfaced during Nintendo's latest Direct showcase. It'll once again see the titular sleuthing fuzzball team up with human pal Tim Goodman for some crime-fighting adventure, but beyond that details are limited.

Earlier this month, the FTC succeeded in getting a temporary ban placed on Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout bid. Now, ahead of an upcoming hearing regarding the agency's request for a preliminary injunction, the FTC has submitted further documentation on the matter.


In a new and heavily redacted filing, the FTC has refered back to Microsoft's acquisition of ZeniMax and Bethesda. The company stated Microsoft's decision to make ZeniMax games exclusive is "powerful evidence of incentive to foreclosure".
