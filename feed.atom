Announcing graduation to General Availability (GA) - Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment in Kubernetes v1.28!
Kubernetes SIG Storage team is thrilled to announce that the "Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment" feature,
introduced as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.25, has now graduated to GA and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.28 release.
This enhancement brings a significant improvement to how default
StorageClasses are assigned to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
With this feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and then a PVC to assign the class.
Instead, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned will now be retroactively updated to include the default StorageClass.
This enhancement ensures that PVCs no longer get stuck in an unbound state, and storage provisioning works seamlessly,
even when a default StorageClass is not defined at the time of PVC creation.
What changed?
The PersistentVolume (PV) controller has been modified to automatically assign a default StorageClass to any unbound
PersistentVolumeClaim with the storageClassName not set. Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim
admission validation mechanism within
the API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.
How to use it?
As this feature has graduated to GA, there's no need to enable a feature gate anymore.
Simply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.
For more details, read about
default StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Making of Karateka, a new "interactive documentary" telling the story of Prince of Persia and The Last Express creator Jordan Mechner's classic 1984 martial arts game, is launching for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation on 29th August, with a Switch version to follow in September.


It's the work of Digital Eclipse, the studio behind last year's acclaimed Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, and promises a similarly styled delve into video gaming's past, combining interviews, new video features, design documents, audio, and photos to create what the developer is calling the "deepest, most exhaustive exploration of the making of a single video game that's ever been attempted in a video game itself."


"Jordan Mechner," the studio explains, "was an 18-year-old college student when he started making the martial arts adventure that would become one of the most influential games of the Apple II era. The Making of Karateka presents the story behind Mechner's first published game through an exhaustive archive...that can be explored at your own pace."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dimension Shellshock, the first paid DLC expansion for Tribute Games' acclaimed brawler Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, launches for all platforms on 31st August.


Previously, Tribute revealed Dimension Shellshock would add a new playable character in the form of the Ninja Turtles' occasional ally Miyamoto Usagi - who originally made the jump from his own Usagi Yojimbo comic series into the turtles' world back in 1987 - and the developer has now unveiled a second playable character: the former Foot Clan member, Karai.


"Karai's signature snark brings a bite to the fight alongside her deadly skills with her swift ninjutsu strikes," publisher Dotemu explains in its release date annoucement. "With Karai at your side there's no stopping the Turtles as they kick, punch and party their way across the various new worlds in Dimension Shellshock's rift-jumping battles."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian has said it's "changing the way we deploy patches" after it was forced to rollback yesterday's Hotfix #4 due to crashing issues - a move that temporarily prevented players from accessing any saves made during the time the update was deployed.


Understandably, the rollback caused consternation among affected players, and now, in a message accompanying today's redeployment of Hotfix #4 on PC, Larian says, "We recognise the frustration caused by this and want to apologise. That's why we're changing things up."


First, though, it offered context for yesterday's bungled release, explaining, "Hotfix #4 went through a rigorous QA pipeline and was confirmed as a candidate for release yesterday. However, we triggered a rebuild of the version relatively last minute to change the version number. The version that was cooked was unfortunately plagued by compiler corruption, which was causing certain exceptions that normally wouldn't cause crashes to - you guessed it - cause crashes." Larian calls these kinds of compiler issues "extremely rare", adding, "We weren't prepared for it. We should've been. We messed up."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its odd little pre-amble last night, Activision and developer Sledgehammer have given Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 the full reveal treatment, sharing first details on its campaign, multiplayer, and zombies mode, alongside a brief look at the game in action.


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which launches this November, is a direct sequel to last year's Infinity Ward developed Modern Warfare 2, pitting Captain Price and Task Force 141 against recurring antagonist Vladimir Makarov, who continues to extend his grasp across the world.


Starting with its campaign, Call of Duty's familiar cinematic missions will be joined by what Activision is calling Open Combat Missions, which are intended as more open-ended objectives, featuring multiple paths and approaches, that emphasise player choice. These will take place "across the sizeable landscape of a mission's AO " and "adapt to different playstyles", from stealth to run-and-gun action, so "players can truly play how they want."

Of course, Jesus is an AI. At one point, he even admits he's "not the physical Jesus", so at least he sounds self aware. The channel states it was made possible due to contributions from The Singularity Group - not a Christian organisation - and tech from PlayHT, an AI-powered voice generation platform that replicates celebrity voices.


Whose face and voice is used for AI Jesus? It's unclear. Is it entertaining? Sort of. Is this really the sort of content Twitch should be used for? Debatable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creator of a GTA AI mod has had their mod shutdown entirely by Take-Two.


Earlier this week we reported on the Sentient Streets mods for GTA 5 created by Bloc, which uses AI to generate free conversations with NPCs.



Now, the mod's NexusMods listing and a YouTube video showcasing its gameplay have both been made unavailable due to copyright claims by publisher Take-Two. Sentient Streets is no longer available to download.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA says it will not contest a €10.8k (£9.2k) fine laid down by an Austrian court that decided FIFA Ultimate Team packs constituted a breach of the country's gambling laws. 


Naturally, EA says it still disagrees with the verdict.


This decision will likely have no wider impact, GamesIndustry.biz reports, as Austrian courts rule on individual cases without a need for their impact to be felt in subsequent cases.

The Bethesda game will therefore leave the service a year after it joined, and two years after it was first released. The game also launched on Game Pass last year, where it will remain across both Xbox Series X/S and PC.


PlayStation owners have until 19th September to break the loop.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Mazin was asked how many seasons the show would likely need to tell all of its story. In response, Mazin stated that "four seems like a good number". 


"You never know," he said. "It can end up being three or five. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we're telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."

"We have dedicated the past year to reviewing our business model alongside months of extremely valuable player testing of the gameplay experience," a Sega spokesperson told me. 

"We're very excited with this progress and the reaction to yesterday's gameplay reveal. We'll build on that foundation with our Closed Beta test beginning 31st August and use this insight to finalise our plans for launch."

Subjects tackled are inevitably rather chaotically broad (and, alas, disappointingly sandwich-free), guided as they were by fans with radically differing concerns, but the end is still a fascinating peek into a game that remains a little enigmatic so close to launch.


We now, for instance, know (thanks Games8) that Starfield will feature various possible punishments for those caught doing naughty things like smuggling contraband. Illegal goods are frowned upon across the galaxy (which is said to operates within a fixed economy, although buy and sell prices can be influenced with certain skills), and must be smuggled past security ships orbiting major settlements by stuffing them inside special purchasable ship modules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't worry PS5 owners, you too get some preload news today! Developer Larian has revealed that Baldur's Gate 3 preloads will begin for the console on 31st August. Additionally, the studio has now release Hotfix #4 for PC players, meaning everybody'll soon be able to enjoy the stupendous CRPG a little more bug-free.


Starting with preloads, the exact date when PlayStation 5 users can start cramming Baldur's Gate 3 onto their SSDs depends on the version they've pre-purchased. Those who've opted for the Digital Deluxe Edition can start clogging their internet pipe from 5pm BST on 31st August, ahead of the game's early access launch on 2nd September.


Owners of the standard edition, meanwhile, can begin preloading Baldur's Gate 3 (which weighs in at around 122GB on PC, so it's not an insignificant download) from 4th September at 5pm BST, 48 hours before its 6th September general release.

As its name implies, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a direct sequel to last year's Modern Warfare 2 (and not a direct sequel to 2009's Modern Warfare 2, which would just be odd), promising the return of "iconic heroes and villains alike".


We already know that players will be able to bring their Modern Warfare 2 inventory and weapons progression into this year's Sledgehammer-developer sequel, but now Activision has teased a few additional details, including the return of Modern Warfare Zombies mode, which is described as the "largest Zombies offering to date."

The Kubernetes Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature is now GA in Kubernetes v1.28.
It was introduced as
alpha
in Kubernetes v1.24, and promoted to
beta
in Kubernetes v1.26.
This feature allows stateful workloads to restart on a different node if the
original node is shutdown unexpectedly or ends up in a non-recoverable state
such as the hardware failure or unresponsive OS.
What is a Non-Graceful Node Shutdown
In a Kubernetes cluster, a node can be shutdown in a planned graceful way or
unexpectedly because of reasons such as power outage or something else external.
A node shutdown could lead to workload failure if the node is not drained
before the shutdown. A node shutdown can be either graceful or non-graceful.

The hugely anticipated Starfield - an ambitious mash-up of Garfield and Stars in Their Eyes - is still a little way off, of course, launching for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 6th September. Impatient sorts with languorous internet connects can, however, begin the potentially lengthy process of downloading its 125GB of space-fun well in advance as per today's announcement.


Those looking to play Starfield on Xbox Series X/S or on PC via the Windows Store can get their pre-load going starting tomorrow, 17th August, while Steam users will need to wait a little longer; Bethesda says preloads via Valve's store will begin on Wednesday, 30th August.

It's been a little while since we've heard something on Hyenas' development, and it feels a long time since the project was first publicly confirmed a year ago, back in August 2022, following an early alpha test footage leak.


Now, you'll soon be able to play it for yourself - via a PC closed beta test running from 31st August to 11th September. Interested? You can register now via Steam.

Nebraska will arrive sometime after the launch of American Truck Simulator's upcoming Kansas expansion, which was announced as the sim's next DLC, and its 14th explorable state, earlier this year. So far, since American Truck Simulator's arrival back in 2016, SCS has released digital reimaginings of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and the recently launched Oklahoma.


Kansas is next, and, as detailed in a blog shared shortly after Oklahoma arrival, Nebraska - which continues American Truck Simulator's by now fairly predictable west to east, south to north expansion across the US - will eventually bring the number of playable states up to 15.

However, those anticipating an evening of explosive video game megaton reveals should probably keep their expectations in check. Keighley added, "This year's Opening Night Live is less about announcing brand-new projects, and more about giving fans updates on some of the biggest games due out over the next year."

Right now, its innards remains mysterious, but that'll change next week when Bungie shares first details in a newly announced livestream.


Things get underway next Tuesday, 22nd August, at 4pm BST/8am PT via Twich, YouTube, and TikTok, with a one-hour pre-show. The show proper begins an hour later, bringing details of The Final Shape expansion, Destiny 2's Season 22, its next reprised raid, and more.


Bungie says the main show will then be followed by a live post-show, featuring a roundtable developer discussion focusing on what players can expect to see over the coming year for Destiny 2. Those viewing via Twitch, incidentally, can get an exclusive emblem by watching for any 30 minutes between the start of the showcase and the end of the post-show.

I've spotted two Lone Wolf mods on NexusMods, both inspired by the perk of the same name in Divinity: Original Sin 2 to boost solo play.


The first, from fenix aka sp8cemonkey83, adds one additional Action charge, 30 percent more hit points, 50 percent more carrying capacity, 1d4 bonus to all d20 rolls, and more frequent use of weapon actions (per battle, rather than per short rest).

Bethesda's timeline begins in 2050, when humans first arrive on Mars. Such a date is relatively consistent with NASA's own estimates of when humanity will touch down on the Red Planet, after returning to the Moon later this decade.


After that, Bethesda jumps forward 56 years to humanity's 2156 arrival in Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the Sun. And it's here we really start to enter science fiction.

Imagine you've spent two hours in the character creator sculpting a face for your character, only to watch the first cutscene and realise that actually, you regret those design choices. It's a modern horror story.

If this is your experience in Baldur's Gate 3 at the moment then you're stuck with your character - unless you decide to restart the game - because there's no way to customise their appearance past the character creation stage. Hopefully, that won't be the case for much longer, now Larian is working on bringing an editing feature to the game.

Writing to acknowledge the game's 8th August anniversary, producer Akitoshi Kawazu seemed eager to work on a fresh title in the series.


"Personally, I feel regret for not being able to satisfy the fans who have been holding out hope for an all-new FFCC game," Kawazu said. "While there's so much I'd like to do, I just can't find the time to do it all. I know that the characters deserve to shine again, yet I've been unable to provide them with another adventure."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report from Axios has shed fresh light on Embracer Group's mysterious $2bn "major strategic partnership" which collapsed spectacularly back in May, causing its shares to drop by 40 percent and sending the company into cost-cutting mode.


At the time, Embracer - the enormous umbrella corporation which owns more than 100 studios including Borderlands developer Gearbox, publishing groups such as THQ Nordic, Koch Media and Saber Interactive, and franchises such as Tomb Raider and Deus Ex - explained it had reached a verbal commitment in October 2022 that would have resulted in more than $2bn "in contracted development revenue over a period of six years." However, at the 11th hour, Embracer said it "received a negative outcome from the counterparty".


While Embracer declined to confirm who its proposed partner was at the time of its announcement, a new report from Axios, citing "four sources familiar with the deal", claims it was the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group, the gaming-focused arm of the Saudi investment fund set up by the hugely controversial Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Axios says the proposed deal would have seen $2bn being invested in the development and publishing of games from Embracer, but adds its sources were "less certain about why Savvy walked away".

Microsoft's Xbox Brazil account on X, formerly Twitter, yesterday posted a Father's Day message featuring celebrated dads in gaming from various Xbox titles - and also one other: Barrett from Final Fantasy 7 Remake.


The post was then swiftly deleted, causing fans to speculate that perhaps the game may have been included as a tease for it appearing on Xbox consoles (thanks, The Gamer).

That's a week sooner than its previous launch date, which was set for 12th October. 


The move means Mirage will now have more of a gap between its October launch and some of the many other games due in the same month: Lords of the Fallen, Alan Wake 2, Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Wonder.

Using hacked Pokémon is technically against the rules, but players haven't always been caught. However, at this year's tournament in Yokohama, Japan, the rules were seemingly tightened and many players who travelled across the world were disqualified.


As a result, the community has been debating whether using hacked teams is an acceptable method of saving time, or if it's against the spirit of the monster training games.

The Pokémon series' breakneck launch rate has recently seen at least one major game or pair of expansions released per calendar year, and it's something fans say is having a detrimental effect on the games themselves, particularly as the series has morphed to become fully open-world. 


Last year, Nintendo was forced to apologise for the state Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived in at launch, and acknowledged the technical issues affecting each games' performance. Now, The Pokémon Company has also addressed the issue.

In honour of the movie's 30th anniversary – and no doubt buoyed by the animated movie's recent success – on 15th September 2023, Japanese audiences will be treated to a 4K re-release of the cult classic, which was called Super Mario: Goddess of the Demon Empire locally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of our reporting on PlayStation 5's new Dolby Atmos support in last week's DF Direct Weekly, Sony's marketing team got in touch with a response from PS5 lead system architect, Mark Cerny, on how the new surround sound set-up actually works. In the Direct, we speculated that the PS5's existing, very impressive Tempest 3D audio data was most likely being recalculated and injected into the Dolby Atmos 'container'.
If you think about it, this is an innovative solution but it's also the only way that the PS5's existing library of titles can actually work with Atmos set-ups as until now, developers would not have mastered audio to support the 7.1.4 speaker system. 
In his statement, Mark Cerny takes us through the entire audio pipeline in PlayStation 5 and how support has been extended to accommodate the extra speakers that an Atmos set-up supplies. The nature of Sony's solution means that the Atmos support is entirely lag-free, in contrast to some issues we've had with Xbox and Windows PCs. Is this solution actually an Atmos mix though? It's 'as good as' from a mathematical perspective, but with full support now added, sound engineers can master their audio mixes on full Atmos-spec equipment, meaning there's scope for further improvement.

In a post on the official subreddit that has racked up hundreds of up-votes, u/Neville_Lynwood has identified that although lots of players prefer to avoid Long Rests, failure to do so can impede progress, as Larian has "a lot of events, companion quests, romances, side characters, and even main story events to you having a Long Rest".

Neville_Lynwood points out that whilst "thematically [it] makes sense" to Long Rest in order to "reflect on stuff that has happened", we're all essentially "de-incentivised" from doing so because you lose your temporary buffs and elixirs… which is a problem, given some think that a lack of rest results in "breaking the narrative progression which leads to event flags and triggers getting jumbled", leading to "all kinds of bugs".

In a lengthy tweet earlier this week, Harada expressed his frustration at some of the messages he receives, appending an image of one which threatened to "hit [him] with a burning hammer" if Eddy isn't in Tekken 8.

"When people make these silly threats, I and everyone at FGC suffer the following losses," Harada said, and then detailed the impact "silly" threats have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar has hired the team behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and RDR2 RedM multiplayer mods, Cfx.re – the same team that been banned from playing the game back in 2015.

The studio announced the news on the company's website and social media channels, stating that it was "proud" to welcome the team to Rockstar Games.

The news is particularly surprising given the modders were banned from the game back in 2015. Despite attempting to comply with Rockstar's rules - which stated that modding of the developer's official GTA Online mode will face the banhammer - and making their own multiplayer service away from GTA Online, Rockstar banned them anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FC Barcelona has renewed its partnership with Konami, making the Japanese developer the "official football video game partner of the Catalan club".

The renewal means that the Spanish champions remain as one of the "core clubs" featured in Konami's free-to-play football series, eFootball, which, of course, started life a long time ago as the premium football game, Pro Evolution Soccer (PES).

The formal partnership means Konami retains "multiple rights" with the football team, including "player access, media opportunities, and event exposure". For players, this means you'll be able to power up your Dream Team with three new Epic cards for the FC Barcelona legends Rivaldo, Patrick Kluivert, and Javier Saviola – you have until 17th August to claim them – and be able to play on the hallowed turf of the Camp Nou (even if the real players can't right now).

That's according to distributor Plaion (formerly known as Koch Media), which is listing a firm release date of 1st December on its website, even though a release date has not yet been confirmed by development studio GSC Game World, which is also self-publishing the first-person shooter survival horror game.

As noted by Andrew Marmo (thanks, wccftech), who spotted the listing, it seems unlikely that this is a placeholder, as the website is listing other games with no firm release window with the placeholder date of 31st December, 2023.

As spotted and translated by Call of Duty specialist CharlieIntel - and as is usually the case these days - you'll only be able to participate in the first beta if you've pre-ordered the game first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was only released on Steam two days ago, but Overwatch 2 is already breaking records, albeit probably not the ones Blizzard was hoping for. In just 48 hours, the free-to-play hero shooter has become Steam's "worst game of all time".

Despite peaking at around 75K players and amassing thousands of reviews, the shooter has leapt to the top of Steam's chart of the worst-received games after review bombers awarded it an aggregate user score of around 1.09, making it the "worst reviewed" game on Steam, according to Steam250's Hall of Shame.

Whilst the game's delayed arrival on Steam was a celebration for some, players have come en masse to leave scathing user reviews, complaining about all manner of things, from the lack of content, pricey cosmetic skins, and balance issues. Others are just annoyed it's not Team Fortress 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mediterranea Inferno, the "mature and treacherous" summer adventure from Lorenzo Redaelli, the creator of The Milky Way Prince - Vampire star, is coming to Steam on 24th August.


Mediterranea Inferno, which is being published by the ever-wonderful Santa Ragione (Saturnalia, MirrorMoon EP), tells the story of three young men in their early 20s who reunite for a sensual summer retreat in southern Italy after some time apart during the isolation of the COVID pandemic, hoping to rekindle their friendship.


"A lazy afternoon by the pool, a lustful night at the club, or even a morbid visit to the local cemetery," explains Mediterranea Inferno's Steam page, "you'll decide how to spend this summer vacation, but wherever you go, something or someone will be waiting, offering an additional, forbidden trip through the arcane inner spaces of conscience."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THQ Nordic's annual digital showcase has been and gone for another year, and while there were plenty of familiar faces returning from 2022's outing, it did bring a couple of new reveals. The publisher's South Park game finally got a proper unveiling in the form of Snow Day, for instance, and was followed by announcements for the likes of Titan Quest 2 and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin. For a full recap of everything shown, do read on.

South Park: Snow Day!

Eschewing the cartoon's classic construction paper looks in favour of boring old 3D, South Park: Snow Day is a co-op adventure that sees up to four players - in the roles of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, naturally - enjoying their day away from school by battling through the snow-blanketed South Park streets on a quest to save the world. There's no release date for this one yet (expect to read this a lot as the recap presses on), but it's coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch some time next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Substantiating a Bloomberg report from earlier this year, Netflix has quietly released a new "game controller" app for iOS intended to make it possible for subscribers to play its games on their TV. The major wrinkle in all this, however, is that it currently doesn't actually do anything.


As spotted by TechCrunch, the Netflix Game Controller app (as it's official known) slipped onto the iOS App Store with zero fanfare, and zero official word from Netflix, earlier this week. Thankfully, there's little mystery surrounding its purpose; the app comes with a full description explaining, "Play games on your TV with the Netflix Game Controller. This Game Controller app pairs with your TV and allows you to play games on Netflix using your phone or mobile device."


Netflix's description also clearly notes the feature is "coming soon", and indeed, downloading the app and firing it up doesn't do much at all. It does offer up a message informing users, "To begin, choose a game on your TV and follow the directions to connect", but with no matching functionally currently built into the main Netflix app, that's as far as things go.

It all begins with character creation, of course, which is what most of these stats consider.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a week since Baldur's Gate 3 released in full on PC and already there are a whole host of mods available, aimed at both aiding combat and character development - or potentially breaking the game.


As a newbie to both Baldur's Gate 3 and D&D, I've found the game a little impenetrable so far (but still enjoyable!) and combat is certainly tricky. So, I won't lie, I've been eyeing up some mods to help out.


So, here are ten mods to help out in Baldur's Gate 3 - available now on NexusMods. Just beware, they may end up ruining the balance.

<blockquote><p>&#8220;SoK: The Ghost Trilemma&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Trolls, bots, and sybils distort online discourse and compromise the security of networked platforms. User identity is central to the vectors of attack and manipulation employed in these contexts. However it has long seemed that, try as it might, the security community has been unable to stem the rising tide of such problems. We posit the Ghost Trilemma, that there are three key properties of identity&#8212;sentience, location, and uniqueness&#8212;that cannot be simultaneously verified in a fully-decentralized setting. Many fully-decentralized systems&#8212;whether for communication or social coordination&#8212;grapple with this trilemma in some way, perhaps unknowingly. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we examine the design space, use cases, problems with prior approaches, and possible paths forward. We sketch a proof of this trilemma and outline options for practical, incrementally deployable schemes to achieve an acceptable tradeoff of trust in centralized trust anchors, decentralized operation, and an ability to withstand a range of attacks, while protecting user privacy...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

For now, the experience is designed for candidates in junior roles, with the idea that it will appeal to those who played Roblox as they were growing up.

But perhaps the most underrated character is the narrator, acting as the DM and narrating the story with typical second-person phrasing. Far from a blank narration, there's plenty of personality in the delivery.


That's thanks to voice actor Amelia Tyler, who's been sharing hilarious outtakes over on her YouTube channel.

The hit RPG is playable in four-player co-op, which fills out the party and leaves no room for companions like Lae'zel, Astarion, and Gale and means players could miss out on their unique stories.


Vincke, however, has suggested not interacting with companions and saving them instead for solo play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acid Wizard Studios - the developer behind 2017's stupendous top-down survival horror Darkwood - has announced an indefinite, years-long hiatus, just months after unveiling its first new game in half a decade, Soccer Kids.


Darkwood initially released into Steam early access back in 2014, quickly becoming a horror favourite with its strange, oppressive atmosphere and strikingly effective presentation, but following its full release in 2017 and a period of patching, Acid Wizard all but vanished.


The Polish studio finally resurfaced earlier this year, explaining in a blog post shared in June that its absence was a result of Darkwood's intense five-year development which, it said, "took a toll on us, both mentally and physically." That necessitated an extended break, after which the studio was ready to think about its next game, and while a Darkwood sequel was considered, "the memory of the inhuman amount of work put into Darkwood was still there".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's Build a Zoo, the cheerful tycoon game with a thing for DNA splicing, is almost ready to swim with the fishes; its previously announced Aquarium Odyssey DLC finally has a release date and will be making a splash on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch next Thursday, 17th August.


Let's Build a Zoo, for the uninitiated, combines familiar zoo management - where the goal is to build and maintain an appealing, lucrative park by importing and breeding animals, managing staff, and so on - with some unusual twists. There's a morality system - meaning you can either strive for ethical excellence or just go all-in on, you know, handbag manufacturing - as well as the kind of science-run-amok that would make the Jurassic Park boffins blush.


Essentially, any of the many animals available in-game can be DNA spliced with a second to create a dependably bizarre hybrid, which, helpfully, tends to be quite popular with the visitors. You could science-up a crocoduck, for instance, or a giraffephant, or a chickow.

As with 2021's similarly styled Quake 1 remaster, this enhanced version of the sequel has been handled by retro specialists Nightdive Studios. Its list of additions is extensive too, including enhanced models and cinematics, dynamic and coloured lighting, improved enemy animations and gore, "improved and restored" AI behaviour, new accessibility features, plus anti-aliasing, depth of field, and support for widescreen resolutions up to 4K. And, of course, Sonic Mayhem's original soundtrack returns in all its furious glory.


And as with 2021's Quake 1 remaster, id has put together an impressively generous package, incorporating Quake 2's base game, as well as its two expansions - The Reckoning and Ground Zero - which, between then, bring 33 additional campaign levels and 21 new multiplayer deathmatch maps. Furthermore, it includes a brand-new expansion, Call of the Machine, from Wolfenstein: The New Order developer Machine Games, introducing a further 28 campaign levels and one new deathmatch map.

In a blog post published today, Bungie said that Zavala was "central" to Destiny's story, and that the character will continue to remain prominent for years to come.


Henceforth, Zavala's English voice lines will be provided by veteran actor Keith David, starting with next year's climactic expansion The Final Shape - "and beyond".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Altagram, the translation company which was found to have not credited staff who worked for years on Baldur's Gate 3, has issued a lengthy public apology and a list of commitments to change.


In a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, Altagram said that it had "come to our attention that the omission of translator credits from our contribution to Baldur's Gate 3 has generated frustration and disappointment among the freelance translator community". 


Disappointment in the lack of creditation was initially directed at Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. But in an exclusive statement given to Eurogamer yesterday, Larian said Altagram had failed to provide a full list of names, and that it was now working to ensure these were all added to the game in a forthcoming patch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new Lords of the Fallen is shaping up pretty nicely, and it's certainly a looker in terms of pure detail. Some followers of the upcoming Soulslike, however, have been curious about how it'll run on their hardware, ever since developer Hexworks revealed some relatively high PC spec requirements without much of an idea for target performance.


Speaking to Eurogamer at a recent preview event, executive prodcer Saul Gascon and creative director Cezar Virtosu gave us some more detail, and confirmed console versions will have a quality and performance mode to choose between.


"What is important for us is that whenever we put [out] minimum specs, like [Nvidia] 10 series, basically, the game runs well and looks good," Gascon said. "So we play of course with that, we do 720p and then upscale."

The bug in question only affected a fraction of players, but this small number included Eurogamer's own reviewer - something which has impacted our efforts to get a Baldur's Gate 3 review to you.



So why did the bug happen? It turns out there was simply too much to do in the game for player save files to cope.

This year's Tetris film, starring Taron Egerton, retells the same story - which is of course based closely on real-life events. Still, Ackerman has now launched legal proceedings over the movie being "similar in almost all material aspects".

Wiglett debuted in last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and quickly became something of a favourite.


The Pokémon Company releases plush toys of most Pokémon species, though the product photos for Wiglett's design have caught the eye of fans, and are being rapidly shared around social media.

Flavourworks, meanwhile, remains best known as the developer of Erica, which first launched for PlayStation 4 back in 2019. In the years since it has refocused around mobile, and released the similarly movie-like Hush - Crane, based around the company's smart TouchVideo tech.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 10 years since acclaimed "dystopian document thriller" Papers, Please first released, and to celebrate that milestone, developer Lucas Pope has released an official Game & Watch inspired demake, as well as discounting the original by 80% on all platforms.


Papers, Please made its debut on 8th August 2013, casting players as an immigration officer on the border of fictional Eastern Bloc country, Arstotzka. On the face of it, the task it sets is simple, requiring players - via a gloriously tactile interface - to crosscheck paperwork with the information provided by each visitor in order to decide whether to approve or deny their entry.


As time goes on, though, complications arise, and as individual stories begin to unfold, a challenging sense of morality weighs on proceedings. You've a family to support at home and a pitiful salary in which to do so; bribes are offered; threats of terrorism loom, and what seem like simple decisions can mean the difference between life and death.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its 20th anniversary celebrations, Obsidian Entertainment has been airing a documentary series digging into the studio's history, and the newly aired final episode has a little to say about its future too, sharing a few details on the upcoming Avowed, including the revelation it started life as a co-op experience before pivoting to a single-player RPG.


"When I look back at 20 years, there's decisions of mine that I feel really good about, there's decisions that I feel not so good about", studio head Feargus Urquhart admits at one point in the documentary. "One of the things where I really pushed was that Avowed was going to be multiplayer, and I kept on that for a long time."


Urquhart says his insistence on multiplayer came from the belief it would make Avowed more interesting to publishers. At the time, the studio was independent - its since been acquired by Microsoft - and Urquhart reasoned, "When you're asking for 50, 60, 70, 80 million, you've got to have something interesting to talk about and multiplayer made it interesting."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the official unveiling of Modern Warfare 3 earlier this week, Activision has confirmed players will be able to transfer a "vast amount" of previously acquired Modern Warfare 2 content over to this year's sequel when it launches in November.


Activision shared the news in a blog on the Call of Duty website, explaining that transferable content will include the likes of "weapons and cosmetic content, including Bundles, Operators, and other rewards" previously unlocked by players or currently available in Modern Warfare 2. 


While most previously accrued Modern Warfare 2 content will be available in Modern Warfare 3, there are some exceptions, primarily where gameplay differences exist between the two games. "For example, if MW3 doesn't have the Tactical Amphibious Vehicle, or a specific piece of Tactical or Lethal Equipment in any game modes," Activision explains, "any Skins you’ve unlocked for these items in MW2 won't be in MW3." Wartracks music will also not transfer.

Earlier today, a post on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted the fact that the game's credits currently only list a fraction of the localisation team who worked on the game's mammoth script for more than three years.


Now, in a statement to Eurogamer, Larian has said the issue lay with the list of staff it was given by localisation firm Altagram - and that it has now demanded a full list of staff for inclusion in an immediate update.

The additions include two games that will be joining day one: Sea of Stars and Moving Out 2. Of course, Sony's first party games still won't join the service at launch but these two follow Stray and Tchia as day one third-party releases.


Sea of Stars (29th August) is developer Sabotage's take on a classic RPG, while Moving Out 2 (15th August) is a wild furniture-packing game ideal for multiplayer - this sequel introduces online co-op with cross-play enabled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashback 2, the sequel to Delphine Software's classic 16-bit sci-fi puzzle-platformer, now has a release date and is launching for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 16th November. And to celebrate the news, developer Microids has shared a fresh look at the game in action, this time showcasing its sprawling city of New Washington.


The original Flashback, for those unfamiliar, launched in 1992, charting the 22nd century adventures of agent Conrad B. Hart on the trail of shapeshifting aliens attempting to infiltrate human society. Flashback 2 - which was previously only confirmed for a slightly more vague "November" release before today's announcement - sees the return of Conrad B. Hart as he once again goes in search of his friend Ian.


Flashback 2's most obvious departure from its predecessor is its shift to new-fangled 3D characters and environments - the first game utilised striking rotoscoped animation for its staunchly side-scrolling action - which in turn has allowed Microids to introduce greater freedom of movement, with Hart now able to move not only left and right but forward and back.

This isn't the first time we've seen Take-Two effectively pencil in the launch of GTA6 for the coming financial year - which runs from April 2024 to March 2025. But it is, again, a clear sign that Rockstar's still under-wraps behemoth is actually not that far off.


Speaking last night in an investor call, Take-Two's chief financial officer Lainie Goldstein spoke of a "significant inflection point" and "record levels of operating performance" on the horizon - which is all corporate speak for  giant wads of cash.

This is when the differences in Goldeneye 007 were noticed, though dataminer LuigiBlood has also suggested they could have been made during an earlier update to the N64 emulator.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> With recent developments in deep learning, the ubiquity of microphones and the rise in online services via personal devices, acoustic side channel attacks present a greater threat to keyboards than ever. This paper presents a practical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning model in order to classify laptop keystrokes, using a smartphone integrated microphone. When trained on keystrokes recorded by a nearby phone, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%, the highest accuracy seen without the use of a language model. When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video-conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium. Our results prove the practicality of these side channel attacks via off-the-shelf equipment and algorithms. We discuss a series of mitigation methods to protect users against these series of attacks...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reactions to Rockstar's recently announced PS4 and Switch port of open-world cowboy classic Red Dead Redemption have been mixed to say the least, with its £40/$50 USD price point coming in for particular criticism. However, Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, has now insisted that price is "commercially accurate".


Those unhappy with the Red Dead Redemption port's price tag have noted this re-release is missing the multiplayer mode included in the original now-13-year-old game, and fails to take advantage of the modern technology it's running on. It doesn't help, either, that the Xbox 360 version, which is playable on Xbox One and Series X/S via backward compatibility, can currently be purchased digitally for £30.


Speaking to IGN, however, Take-Two CEO Zelnick has brushed off complaints, insisting, "That's just what we believe is the commercially accurate price for it". He also noted the inclusion of Undead Nightmare in the Switch and PS4 port, calling the zombie-themed DLC a "great standalone game in its own right when it was originally released, so we feel like it's a great bundle for the first time, and certainly a great value for consumers."

"Each Certified Refurbished Steam Deck has been thoroughly tested to the same high standards as our retail units," Valve's explains over on its newly launched store page. "Every device goes through a complete factory reset, software update, and an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve's facilities."


Refurbished units come with a one year warranty, a refurbished power supply, and a carrying case, and while Valve notes some might sport "minor cosmetic blemishes" - specifically, small blemishes or scratches on the plastic casing rather than screen - it says all units "provide a reliable, high-quality gaming experience at a lower cost".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been furiously refreshing your storefront of choice ready for WrestleQuest's arrival today, you might want to calm your finger; developer Mega Cat Studios has announced a very-last-minute delay, pushing the exuberant wrestling RPG's launch back to 22nd August.


WrestleQuest, which Mega Cat describes as a collision between pro wrestling and RPG fantasy, was originally due to launch for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC today, 8th August. However, the studio has now opted to postpone its release for a couple of weeks after discovering a save-deleting bug during last-minute testing.


"When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms," the developer explained in a recently shared tweet, "we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following last week's official reveal of Dead by Daylight's Alien collaboration, developer Behaviour Interactive has shared further details, including an August release date and the entirely unsurprising confirmation that Sigourney Weaver's iconic action hero Ellen Ripley will feature as a Survivor, battling against a Xenomorph killer.


The Xenomorph, described as the "embodiment of the stealth Killer", comes with a new power called Runner Mode, enabling it to walk on all four legs, reducing its Terror Radius considerably. It'll also be the first Killer to get its own exclusive sub-level, in this case a series of tunnels only accessible via seven Control Stations dotted around the collaboration's new map.


Control Stations also house the new Survivor-only Remote Flame Turrets, which can stagger the Xenomorph when successfully deployed, causing its unique Power to end. Survivors will need to be careful, however; the turret can overheat, necessitating a repair, and the Xenomorph can destroy it if it isn't adequately protected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you - and your other 800,000 chums - have successfully managed to drag yourself away from the stupendously entertaining Baldur's Gate 3 to read this, congratulations! You'll be thrilled to learn your penis is finally safe from prying eye thanks to developer Larian's second major hotfix release, which, along with winging its wangs away, comes with 300+ other fixes.


Baldur's Gate 3's wang clipping issue does, admittedly, appear to be something of an edge case, only affecting penises C and D, and only for characters wearing certain githyanki clothing. Even so, penises should now be safely tucked away after today's update, doubly so given Larian says hotfix #2 also restores underpants that had unfortunately gone astray, unintentionally vacating the nether regions of male gnome sorcerers. 


The vast majority of other fixes included in today's update are perhaps not quite so exciting - although the removal of the game's version number from beneath the minimap is certainly welcome, as is the addition of more multiplayer servers and server scaling support.

Now, just a month later - and after a price increase for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - Xbox fans have spotted that the trial has been altered to last just 14 days - less than half the time it used to (thanks XGP).

The news has some positives, in that it'll bring the game to more platforms and make it easier to play for people who don't have a PlayStation 3 or play on Xbox. With the game now on all modern platforms, it also guarantees access to it for at least another couple of years which is good for games preservation.
Unfortunately, that's where praise for the re-releases ends, as Red Dead Redemption fans have taken to social channels to voice their disappointment and frustrations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian has explained why the rules of Dungeons and Dragons make any potential expansion to its hit PC role-player "very hard" to make. 


Indeed, Larian currently has no Baldur's Gate 3 expansion in the works.


Speaking to PC Gamer, Larian boss Swen Vincke said the rules of D&D - which Baldur's Gate 3 follows closely - mean any continuation of the game would enter potentially tricky territory, with characters at higher levels able to wield game-breaking godlike powers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devolver Digital has delayed a bunch of its games, and, Devolver being Devolver, it announced those delays in a special three-minute showcase - complete with inane Nindies-style banter - that also (presumably in the name of balance and order) featured a couple of games still on track to release this year. Want to know what landed in which pile? Then here we go.


First up on Devolver's 'now coming in 2024' list is The Plucky Squire, an eye-catching adventure from former Pokémon artist James Turner, that wonderfully blends 2D and 3D as illustrations from a living picturebook escape and begin to cause chaos in the real world.

Equally eye-catching and equally delayed is Sam Eng's Skate Story, in which a skateboarding demon navigates an Underworld made of "glass and pain" in order to swallow the moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark and Darker, the mediaeval extraction looter from Ironmace Games, has - after a turbulent few months and amid ongoing legal troubles - launched into early access, but not on Steam.


Dark and Darker, you might recall, received a hugely positive reception when it featured as part of Valve's Steam Next Fest earlier this year. Soon after, though, Korean game publisher Nexon accused Ironmace of copyright infringement, claiming members of the development team had used "materials and assets they worked on during their time" at Nexon to create Dark and Darker - an accusation Ironmace has repeatedly denied.


Ironmace's woes continued when a cease and desist demand from Nexon forced the game off Steam, and, despite successfully getting Dark and Darker's recent playtests into players' hands through some creative problem solving, the game's early access launch - which was originally planned for late April to early May this year - has seen several delayed.

That's according to Remnant 2 director and Gunfire Games president David Adams, who shared the news during a recent AMA (Ask Me Anything) Q&A session on Reddit.


"Yes, we are looking at it", Adams explained when asked if crossplay was something Remnant 2 might get in the future. "There are issues with the different platforms and what they require in order to allow crossplay," he continued, "but it is being actively worked on".

Today's official reveal comes courtesy of a brisk teaser trailer which, alongside a whole lot of hyperactive whizzing between abstract pointy things, includes glimpses of a few familiar faces from the Call of Duty series - namely Captain Price and Vladimir Makarov - and a voice over warning, "Never bury your enemies alive."


This year's Call of Duty instalment has, of course, been rumoured to be Modern Warfare 3 for quite some time. The name first surfaced back in May, and Activision effectively confirmed it in July when the name appeared during a spate of DMCA takedowns aimed at leakers online.

Originally released in 2010 for the PS3 and Xbox 360, rumours of a remaster have been bubbling for a while, following reports of its development. Last month, a new rating for Red Dead Redemption was spotted, which kept hopes alive.
The release on PS4 and Switch isn't a remaster unfortunately - Rockstar has called it a  "conversion" produced by Double Eleven Studios, which has quite a bit of experience in porting games to modern consoles.

Debate around the term recently resurfaced following comments from Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida in an interview with Skill-Up. Yoshida stated the term "wasn't a compliment to a lot of developers in Japan" and was seen as "discriminatory".


Kamiya, however, is more positive about the term, believing it reflects the "unique sensitivity" of Japanese creators in the games they make.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sales of Final Fantasy 16 did not meet Square Enix's high expectations, said president Takashi Kiryu.


Last week the company's latest earnings report was released and while net sales increased, operating profit dropped 79 percent from ¥14.4bn to just ¥3.0bn.


During a post-earnings call to analysts, Kiryu said the high end of the company's expectations were not met and the slow adoption of the PlayStation 5 was a limiting factor, Bloomberg reports.

After tweeting his progress thus far, confirming that he had fully completed Season 1, Ybarra received a reply from a Diablo 4 fan who said: "Unfortunately some of us cannot do this due [to] a bug".

The issue sees players stuck at Slayer level because the game won't accept that they've completed the A Boon in the Tide quest no matter how many times they attempt to open the Tortured Gift Helltide chest.

According to SteamDB, as of this morning (Sunday 6th August) Baldur's Gate 3 has broken into Steam's top ten most played games. It has amassed a staggering 712,281 concurrent players, becoming Steam's ninth biggest game ever in terms of concurrent player counts.

That means Baldur's Gate 3 has now eclipsed the concurrent Steam player peaks for games like Valheim, Goose Goose Duck, and Respawn's Apex Legends.

Yesterday, the official EU website was seemingly updated to add two news stories to its Tekken 8 mini-site revealing the new additions. Shortly thereafter they were taken down again, but not before eagle-eyed players were able to grab a screenshot. 

Yes, this could be an elaborate hoax – there's no way to be sure, as the Wayback Machine hasn't indexed the site since the end of July – but if true, it does add credence to the incomplete roster that leaked shortly after the closed network test as the new additions see the welcome return of Raven and usher in newcomer Azucena.

Right now, it's unclear if Bandai Namco is issuing strikes to suppress inaccurate data or because the details are correct, but whatever the reason, the publisher is seemingly issuing copyright strikes against YouTubers discussing the leaked roster.

Tekken 8's now closed network test allowed players to sample five stages and 16 playable characters, including Asuka Kazama, Bryan Fury, Claudio Serafino, Hwoarang, Jin Kazama, Jun Kazama, Leroy Smith, Nina Williams, and Paul Phoenix, amongst others.

Talking to Sky News, Harbour – who plays Jack Salter in the movie – said that whilst it may be tempting and "cynical" to believe that most viewers wouldn't know the difference between CGI and real racing scenes, by having real cars racing at 150mph, it "heightened his performance because the stakes are real".

"This movie could've shot in green screen boxes – we could have done all this stuff – but there was something about putting together this team of people who are able to organise all these cars going at the same moment, stopping at the same moment, warming up the tires, all the technical elements," Harbour said, as transcribed by Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is already off to a spectacular start, having now sailed passed the half a million concurrent players mark on Steam after a huge first day, but developer Larian isn't resting on its laurians; the studio has just released its first hotfix for the wildly ambitious RPG which, among other things, takes aim at that nasty save-preventing bug.


Larian acknowledged the save issue and offered some preliminary solutions earlier today, but its first hot fix update aims to tackle things head on. As the developer explains in its accompanying patch notes, after some investigation, it's now found that cross-saves are to blame.


"Bearing in mind this will only be a useful feature come 6th September when the PlayStation 5 version launches (and beyond)," Larian explains, "we've decided to disable it for now to allow us to solve the issue in the interim. You shouldn't notice anything in-game and Steam Cloud saves are unaffected by this change."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Gunfire Games' procedurally generated fantasy shooter Remnant 2 has been a hit, garnering positive reviews and selling over 1m copies in the space of the week. And amid all that excitement (not to mention some cheeky sneakery) Gunfire has been preparing its first major patch for Remnant 2, targeting performance, stability, and various quality of life improvements. It's out now on PC and the developer says a console release should follow "very soon", once the update has cleared Sony and Microsoft's approval process. 


Introducing Remnant 2's new update on its website, Gunfire explains, "We've made our initial pass on stability, and performance on all platforms, focused on progression blockers, bugs, and addressed some Quality of Life requests from the community."


As per Gunfire's Remnant 2 patch notes, today's update features "initial optimisations to improve overall performance", as well as updates to improve hitching and potential crashes, plus fixes to various reported crash bugs. The developer also notes it's now moved high detail shadows to a separate option on PC, which can be activated if required.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed martial arts adventure Sifu is nearing the end of its journey; developer Sloclap has announced the game will be getting its last-ever content update on 7th September.


Sifu has, of course, been around for a while at this point, having launched for PS5 and PC via the Epic Games Store back in February last year. It made the jump to Xbox and Steam this March, bringing its acclaimed third-person, single-player action -  which Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called an "elegant martial arts meditation on temporality and self-possession" in his Recommended review last year - to a whole new audience.


Throughout that time developer Sloclap has steadily expanded and improved on the original experience - which charts a young Kung Fu student's vaguely magical quest for revenge following the murder of his family - releasing a wealth of free content updates, most recently in the form of its Arenas expansion, which added around 10-hours of fresh gameplay nine new locations and "45 merciless challenges spread over five game modes".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're not one of the many PC players already Baldur's deep in a certain RPG spectacular and you're looking for some amusement this weekend, the Epic Games Store has unveiled a fresh batch of freebies to download and keep, which this week take the form of developer Four Quarters' RPG oddity Loop Hero and Ninja Kiwi's vibrant tower defence adventure Bloons TD 6.


Starting with Loop Hero, it's a fantasy RPG with a twist; the twist being your heroes are stuck automatically navigating the procedurally generated world, battling monsters, and so on, in an endless, literal loop. You don't have a whole lot of control over what they do, but as they down enemies you accumulate loot to boost their stats and - more importantly - collect cards to place in the world that introduce new encounters and perhaps new bonuses to be exploited on successive loops. Reach a certain point and you fight a boss, then on it goes.


That's the very basics of it, at least, and Eurogamer's Christian Donlan quite liked its peculiar, grindy progression when he reviewed it back in 2021, slapping it with ye olde Recommended badge, and calling it a "deeply knowing game whose designers pluck at your obsessions as if they're idly reaching into a piano case to twang the strings".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a bit of a ratings board leak earlier this year, a new report has claimed a Quake 2 remaster will - in a move that wouldn't exactly be surprising - be getting an official unveiling during this year's QuakeCon festivities, which take place next week.


A Quake 2 remaster first reared in head in June this year, when a listing appeared on the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea's website. And now, reliable leaker billbil-kun has piped up (thanks VGC) with some fresh information, claiming both an imminent QuakeCon unveiling and a release for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch.


As astute readers may have already spotted, those are the very same platforms that received a Nightdive-Studios-developed 25th anniversary remaster of the original Quake back in 2021. Billbil-kun says the remaster of its sequel will simply be referred to as Quake 2, ditching the 'Remastered' suffix that appeared in the South Korean ratings board listing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eyes might currently be on THQ Nordic's remake of cult-classic action-RPG Gothic, but the company has unexpectedly announced it'll be bringing the two-decade-old original version to Switch on 28th September, with a huge number of fixes.


The original Gothic, which was created by developer Piranha Bytes and released in 2001, follows the story of a convicted prisoner who finds himself on a quest across a dangerous medieval fantasy realm. Its mix of action-orientated open-world exploration and RPG-style customisation has garnered something of a cult following over the years, leading THQ Nordic to start canvassing interest in a remake back in 2019.


It's the 2001 release that's coming to Switch, however, with THQ Nordic promising "great performance and a well adapted user interface and controls" across the 50+ hour adventure. And while the company is clear the Switch port is "the original game code, no remastering, and no remaking", it also shared an absolutely enormous list of fixes it's made for the release.

Microsoft's watchlist for potential studio acquisitions first surfaced back in June during its court battle with US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commision over its planned Activision Blizzard deal, with the likes of Sega, Bungie, CD Projekt Red, No Man's Sky studio Hello Games, Hitman developer IO Interactive, Pokémon Go creator Niantic, and Hades studio Supergiant Games all appearing on its 2021 "consideration set".


Also on there was Larian Studios - which has made the acclaimed likes of Divinity: Original Sin prior to today's eagerly awaited Baldur's Gate 3 - and, now, founder and CEO Swen Vincke has shared more of his thoughts on such acquisitions in an interview with Bloomberg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends: Resurrection, the 18th season of the popular battle royale, will land on Tuesday 8th August. The biggest change coming to the game is the total re-work of the Synthetic Nightmare Revenant. Also, Broken Moon is being added to Mix Tape, the Charge Rifle gets some changes, and early Apex fans may be pleased to hear that Season 2's Disruptor Rounds are coming back!
First thing's first, let's get the big one out of the way - the revamp of Revenant. If you've been playing this deadly Legend throughout season 17 you may have noticed that he's beginning to act strangely, glitching and other out-of-character actions starting to come through. This is the start of the revamp of Apex's Synthetic Nightmare.
It's not a secret that the popularity of Revenant has dropped off in past seasons with their previous abilities not really keeping up with the fast paced combat laid out by the newer Legends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Treasure's classic shoot-em-up Radiant Silvergun is coming soon to Steam, the first time it's been available on PC.



Originally released in 1998 on the Sega Saturn and in arcades in Japan, it was later released on the Xbox 360 in 2011 and last year the Nintendo Switch with local co-op play and online leaderboards, as well as updated graphics.


Judging by the trailer on Steam (the same as the below Switch trailer), it's this version that will soon be released - though the exact release date is unknown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next patch for Diablo 4 will arrive next week and bring buffs for the vilified Sorcerer and Barbarian classes.


In last week's fireside chat with the developers, Blizzard promised improved "effectiveness and fun" for these two classes - now we know exactly how in the latest patch notes for 1.1.1.



For Sorcerers, the intention was to improve late-game survivability and move away from "kiss-curse" effects where players gain power but lose it elsewhere. For Barbarians, the flow of combat will be sped up by increasing Fury generation and the power of Unique items in the late-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Striking Distance Studios, the developer behind last year's sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol, has laid off 32 employees amid efforts to "realign the studio's priorities".


In a statement provided to IGN, the developer wrote, "Striking Distance Studios and [publisher] Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio's priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honouring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment."


As reported by VGC, a number of affected employees began publically discussing the layoffs on social media prior to Striking Distance's official announcement. These included associate level designer Thomas Catalano, VFX artist Matt Christopherson, associate producer Nora Falcon, level design assistant Justin Fields, production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, and senior environment artist Matthew Smith.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to April 2020, and you might recall the wholly unexpected announcement that infamous 80s jungle horror Cannibal Holocaust would be getting a video game sequel. The project's seen a tumultuous few years - and several changes in direction - since then, but its developer has now shed a little more light on its behind-the-scenes struggles, and provided an update on the form it'll take when it eventually arrives next year.


Cannibal, as the project was initially known back in 2020, was announced as a collobaration between Italian developer Fantastico Studio and Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato. Based on one of Deodato's unpublished screenplays, it's technically the fourth sequel to Cannibal Holocaust - a movie that gained notoriety on its original release for its graphic violence, depictions of sexual assault, and actual animal cruelty, making it something of an unlikely candidate for the video game treatment.


In a new interview with PC Gamer, Fantastico's creative director Andrea Valesini explains its original concept for the game was to adapt Deodato's screenplay into a format resembling a visual novel. As per its initial announcement, the project was due to release by the end of 2020, but after an unexpectedly positive response to Cannibal's reveal, the studio decided "it definitely made sense to invest more money into the game" and opted to tackle the screenplay in a more ambitious form, turning it into something closer to an point-and-click adventure.

Judging by Microsoft's post announcing the new feature, getting things working is a pretty straightforward process, piggybacking off the streamlined Discord chat functionality - which replaced the previous mobile device faff - introduced to Xbox last October.


All users need do in order to stream to Discord is press the Xbox button on their controller to access the guide, head to 'Parties & chats', then select 'Discord' from there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What the Golf - developer Triband's extremely daft, but wonderfully entertaining golfing oddity - is gearing up for a busy few months. First up, its free Among Us collaboration is making the jump from Apple Arcade to PC and Switch tomorrow, 3rd August, then the game will be making its  PlayStation debut "soon", with more free content to follow.


What the Golf, if you're unfamiliar, serves up a succession of dependably ludicrous golf-flavoured mini-games, all loosely themed around the notion of hitting things with club. The basic rules are re-jigged and re-written to increasingly improbably degrees with each new level - one stage might see your golf ball turned into an awkwardly rotating office chair, another might send you into space - and the end results is a ceaselessly surprising joy (even if you're not much of a golf fan), that was one of our favourite games of 2019.


Since its original Apple Arcade release, What the Golf has jumped to PC and Switch, receiving various bits of free post-launch content along the way. One of those updates, the aforementioned Among Us collaboration, arrived this April as an Apple Arcade exclusive, but it new overworld and 35+ new levels come to Switch and PC tomorrow, 3rd August.

Speaking to Polish outlet Wyborcza (and translated by Redanian Intelligence), Baginski tried to explain why the TV series had changed plot elements from Andrzej Sapkowski's novels. 


The producer explained a lot happens behind the scenes, such as scripts needing to be rewritten due to a cast member falling ill. "There are a lot of understandable reasons why controversial decisions are made, but the viewer does not have this context, so sometimes it hurts because something was better in the book," Baginski reasoned.

In battle, Merlin - and other "tactical pets" which are yet to be unveiled - will stay strapped to your person, a bit like a gun holstered at your hip. But Merlin and his friends aren't just for show! You can also select your animal friend to carry out a "devastating" finishing move.

The policy will go into effect on 29th August, and has been created from discussions with creators, backers, and "other platform leaders", Kickstarter said.

When submitting a project, creators will be asked to state whether AI is used and how. Creators will also need to confirm they have consent to use any works or data being fed into the AI. Submissions will be put through a "human review process" to ensure the use of AI has been properly disclosed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remnant 2 is doing alright for itself; not only has the Souls-esque procedural shooter secured some extremely positive reviews, it's also selling well too; and amid all the general positivity around its release, there's a bit more fun news courtesy of a whole new secret class that developer Gunfire Games squirrelled away for dataminers to find.


The class (or Archetype, as Remnant 2 would have it) in question is known as the Archon, and requires players to go through an extremely convoluted set of steps to unlock, ranging from activating skills on specific Archetypes at certain levels to equipping a whole lot of gear before hefting the everything over to a very particular place.


The requirements, then, are not the kind of thing anyone is really ever likely to stumble across by accident, with Gunfire Games instead having designed the Archon class to be something that could only realistically be uncovered by dataminers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Volition's beleaguered Saints Row reboot has almost reached the end of its journey - as far as the studio has currently revealed, at least - with the game's third and final bit of DLC, titled A Song Of Ice And Dust, now confirmed to arrive next Tuesday, 8th August, ahead of a Steam release for what was previously an Epic Games Store PC exclusive on 24th August.


Specifics surrounding A Song Of Ice And Dust are still a little thin on the ground, but a brief synopsis accompanying today's release date news sets the scene for the DLC thusly: "When a crippling ambush decimates the Dustlanders, it's up to fierce rivals Bossonius and Gwendolyn Firebird to join forces and defend The DustFaire from a new foe."


As previously revealed when Volition shared its post-launch development roadmap for Saints Row earlier this year, the reboot's third and final paid DLC expansion will introduce new story missions, new enemies, new cosmetics, and more.

More specifically, Apple's gaming subscription service is getting a version of the maraca-shaking classic called Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go, which arrives on 29th August - the same day Samba de Amigo: Party Central launches on Switch.


Party-To-Go will feature 40 songs when it arrives in August, with more to follow after launch. There's no complete track list to peruse yet, but Sega's official announcement says it'll feature three songs exclusive to the Apple Arcade game: Daddy (feat. CL) by Psy, Lady Gaga's The Edge of Glory, and The Walker from Fitz and the Tantrums.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a month after shooting itself into space for the first time, asymmetrical multiplayer horror game Dead by Daylight is doing it all over again, only this time with an official license for the quintessential space scare-'em-up, Alien.


That's Alien singular, of course, Ridley Scott's seminal 1979 space horror in which Sigourney Weaver's iconic action hero Ellen Ripley, along with her crewmates aboard the spaceship Nostromo, are terrorised by an even more iconic phallus-headed extraterrestrial predator known as a Xenomorph. Someone also gets a tummy ache; it's great.


That single, deadly foe (as opposed to the umpteen creatures present in James Cameron's action-heavy 1986 follow-up, Aliens) makes Alien the perfect fit for Dead by Daylight's four-survivors-versus-one-killer set-up. As of right now, however, developer Behaviour Interactive is remaining coy about which of the movie's characters we might get to play as.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're an early access player of Baldur's Gate 3 you should delete your save, delete your mods, and then delete the game itself.


This advice comes direct from developer Larian, which said that doing all of the above would "reduce the risk of file conflicts when the final game downloads", meaning "more playing, and no troubleshooting!"

Players who do have mods installed are also advised to ensure they do not automatically re-download.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rayman's long-awaited return mightn't be quite what fans were hoping for - arriving as he is in a bit of DLC for the excellent Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope instead of his own game - but something's (hopefully) better than nothing, and Ubisoft has now confirmed its beloved limb-flinging mascot will be making his entrance on 30th August this year.


Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope: Rayman in the Phantom Show is described as a brand-new DLC adventure that'll be separate from the base game's storyline. Here, Rabbid Mario and Rabbid Peach stumble across the Space Opera Network, an "uncanny" TV studio run by the Phantom, one of the antagonists in Ubsoft's previous Mario + Rabbids game, Kingdom Battle.


"As the TV studio's rating are lower than ever," Ubisoft explains in its release date announcement, "he needs the help of true stars to help him get his past glory back."

Additionally, trailers for the game have been taken down, due to a copyright claim made by Sony. 


If you head to The Last Hope's Nintendo eShop store page now, you will instead be greeted by a 404 message, and a generic image of Star Fox's Peppy Hare (which is actually more pleasing on the eye than what was there previously).

A new game for the franchise, titled Transformers: Reactivate, is currently in development by Brink developer Splash Damage, but if you were hoping to brush up on older titles ahead of its release, you're out of luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you thought there wasn't anything else left to discover in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, you'd be sorely mistaken. Zelda engineers have now discovered a way to use what they're calling "quantum entanglement" to connect objects together over large distances, without a visible connection between them. 

This process, which has been dubbed "q-linking" by the community, has a brief yet rich history - a previous q-linking method was found in an earlier version of the game but has since been patched out by Nintendo as of version 1.2.0.

Nevertheless, that hasn't stopped Zelda players from experimenting with the game's physics and figuring out the boundaries of what can and cannot be achieved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On its surface, Pikmin is a cute strategy game about growing little plant people and gathering treasure. Delve deeper into its lore, however, and you'll find fans debating the series' apparent commentary on human extinction, and all sorts of timey-wimey shenanigans going on to make its many story elements match up. 

Spoiler warning: the following article discusses endgame details for Pikmin 4.

Before Pikmin 4, I'd never spent much time trying to make Pikmin's setting make sense. It's based on Earth, obviously, though a version with different animals and no humans in sight. And yet, you can still run around and find evidence of human existence - and seemingly very recent human existence at that, with freshly-baked food and other objects simply lying about. Are humans extinct, or have we all simply popped out for tea? It doesn't really matter to the simple stories Pikmin games tell.

Tekken 8's latest network test ran over the weekend, and provided those taking part with a taster of what's in store. But, of course, the beta's files were cracked, allowing some players to continue beyond the test period. 


Perhaps understandably, Bandai Namco does not want this to continue and has now issued a warning to anyone playing a cracked version - saying that anyone continuing to play breaches both the game's terms of service and the Tekken World Tour code of conduct.

Since launching back in 2016, American Truck Simulator's digital reimagining of the US - with its miles of winding road and endless sweeping vistas - has been steadily expanded and refined through a mixture of free and paid updates. Oklahoma brings the game's total number of explorable states up to 13, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas.


SCS says "wonderful state parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends" await those that pick up American Truck Simulator's Oklahoma DLC, and its arrival will be accompanied by a new World of Trucks community event tasking players with communally amassing a total of 111m miles travelled while delivering cargoes - during jobs of at least 100 miles - to or from any of the 10 cities including in the expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, the heavily Jet-Set-Radio-inspired adventure from developer Team Reptile, launches for PlayStation and Xbox on 1st September, two weeks after Switch and PC.


As a mere glimpse will confirm, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk pays homage and then some to Sega's beloved Dreamcast classic Jet Set Radio, sporting an immediately familiar cell-shaded aesthetic as players skate, skateboard, and cycle through the futuristic streets of New Amsterdam, dodging militarised police, spraying graffiti, and facing off against other crews.


Bomb Rush Cyberfunk's New Amsterdam features five main boroughs to explore, and players can make use of a "unique environment based trick system" that includes combos and boost tricks as they roam. Additionally, there're new crew members to recruit along the way, plus a composer line-up including Hideki Naganuma, who wrote Jet Set Radio's soundtrack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following EA Sports FC 24's formal unveiling earlier this month, the steady dripfeed of news continues, with EA now revealing a partnership with the Ballon D'or that'll see the presitgious award come to Player Career mode via a glitzy in-game end-of-season ceremony - for players on current-gen consoles and PC, at least.


The Ballon d'Or has been awarded annually to the best football player of the season by French magazine France Football since 1956, and an award specfically for female players was introduced in 2018. Come the arrival of EA Sports FC this September, those that manage a particularly strong individual season in Player Career mode can earn the Ballon d'Or in-game.


That manifests as a glitzy award ceremony where the winning player steps up on stage to receive the prize amid rapturous applause from the audience. You can watch the proceedings in the latest EA Sports FC video deep dive below, which this time focuses on Career mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has submitted a material changes of circumstances document to the UK's regulator which stands opposed to its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, urging it to drop its block of the deal. 
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority previously ruled that the deal would not be allowed to go ahead back in April, citing concerns on Microsoft's current, and potentially future, dominance in cloud gaming. 
Despite that setback, Microsoft has continued to sign deals with other companies and took on the US Federal Trade Commission in court (and won), leaving the UK's stance to the deal looking increasingly isolated. And it's these fresh commitments, Microsoft says, which should now be considered by the CMA. Had the CMA made its original decision with these in mind, Microsoft now says, the CMA would have ruled differently.

The beta was announced by Hideaki Nishino on the official PlayStation blog earlier today, along with what to expect and how users can take part.

The update will include a "map rework" of Hourglass – expect improved line of sight, traversal, and "combat encounters" now the size has been reduced – as well as all-out warfare attachments for vault weapons SMGs and LMGs, better squad management through improved squad orders, better ammo crates, and dispersion tweaks to SMGs and LMGs.

The rationale behind shrinking the Hourglass map is to "keep combat focused while having more opportunity to defend yourself through added cover".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, after countless rumours and leaks, GameMill finally confirmed that Super Smash Bros.-style fighting game Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 was indeed on the way. Now, however, it seems retailers may have jumped the gun and are listing the game as launching on 24th October.

Whilst we can only take this with the requisite bucket of salt for now, retailers like Amazon UK and Best Buy in the US have already listed the game as releasing at the end of October, even though the launch date has not been formally – or publicly – confirmed. 

The release date has caused quite a commotion with fans of the fighting game, as it releases near or on the same day as highly-anticipated titles like the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection, Sonic Superstars, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Spider-Man 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage will take just 25 hours to complete – or less, if you're not looking to do a "completionist" run. 

In an interview with French YouTuber Julien Chièze – spotted and translated by PCGN – Ubisoft lead producer Fabian Salomon has confirmed that during internal playtesting, it took most players around 20 hours to complete Mirage if they "rushed", and "25-30 hours for completionists".

"Given that we do a lot of playtesting internally at Ubisoft, it's part of our process, we really want to get as close as possible to the players, so we'll say that the latest playtimes we've received average at around 20-23 hours," Salomon said.

That may not sound impressive given PUBG: Battlegrounds holds the top spot with 3.2 million concurrent users – dwarfing that of second place CS:GO's 1.8m peak – but it's a considerable achievement, eclipsing the top concurrent Steam totals for games like Resident Evil Village (106,000), Battlefield 2042 (105,000), and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (103,000).

Its predecessor, Remnant, holds a more modest concurrent record of 48,289 players on Steam, according to SteamDB.

Not to be confused with the more contemporary 2023 game of the same name which runs on different servers and remains unaffected, Activision was forced to take the 2009 version offline on Steam whilst it "investigated reports of an issue".

Although Activision hasn't confirmed what the alleged "issue" is, players believe it is connected to a post shared on the game's Steam forums back in June that warned players to run an antivirus scan, positing that a trojan was being spread almost players "using hacked lobbies".

Developer Grinding Gear Games revealed this to me and a group of press during a briefing ahead of ExileCon in New Zealand this weekend.
The silence around Path of Exile 2 has been almost total since it was announced in 2019. We've seen two chunks of gameplay and that's it. The reason for this silence is because the game has changed significantly since then. Originally, it was going to be an extension of Path of Exile 1 and share content with it,  but now, Path of Exile 2 is a completely separate game.

While we have known about her inclusion for a while now, with developer Larian confirming it to our Bertie earlier in the month, her magical, menace of a character had remained largely under wraps until now. However, new details have now been released about this "grandmaster of murder".


In a new video, Robertson introduced her upcoming villain as "affectionately unhinged", revealing that players won't know when she is about to pop up in Balder's Gate 3 thanks to her shapeshifting abilities. In fact,  Orin is able to take the form of anyone - "perhaps even someone in your camp".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ratata Arts has released a new Ratatan gameplay trailer, to whet appetites for the rhythm strategy game.


The developer said Ratatan's gameplay will incorporate a "unique combination of rhythm and strategy", and see players taking on the role of a conductor. This conductor has the very important job of controlling an army of the titular Ratatan, which will be able to "attack, defend and support" as they march against other armies in the game. 


Additionally, these music loving animal-like creatures will be able to "gather 'Cobuns' that can chant, move and attack according to the instructions". As a result of all this musical mayhem, the developer has promised "one massive rhythmic showdown!" You can see how it all looks in the video below.

The presentation gave us another chance to see the harrowing environments we will be presented with on release. We will be able to explore Axiom, the realm of the living, and Umbral, the realm of the dead.


Each of these realms will have their own enemies, characters, treasures and the like. One example of an enemy in Umbral was a rather unusual head with arms and legs, but no body. This chap is known as a 'Mendacious Visage', and I certainly wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night (although, that is probably exactly what will happen whenever I play the game). There was also another enemy that reminded me of Silent Hill's Pyramid Head.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We demonstrate how images and sounds can be used for indirect prompt and instruction injection in multi-modal LLMs. An attacker generates an adversarial perturbation corresponding to the prompt and blends it into an image or audio recording. When the user asks the (unmodified, benign) model about the perturbed image or audio, the perturbation steers the model to output the attacker-chosen text and/or make the subsequent dialog follow the attacker&#8217;s instruction. We illustrate this attack with several proof-of-concept examples targeting LLaVa and PandaGPT...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Snoop Dog has previously appeared in Call of Duty, and keeping with tradition is set to be "ready for any operation, whether it's going under Deep Cover or going in guns blazin'..."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 has launched with a strong start in Japan, with sales of 401k boxed copies over its first week on sale. 


To put that into context, this is better than the total boxed sales of Pikmin's three previous Japanese launch weeks combined: with 101k sales for Pikmin 1 and 161k first week sales of Pikmin 2 - both on the GameCube - and 92k first week sales of Pikmin 3 on Wii U.


These numbers from Japanese sales company Famitsu (via VGC) paint a rosy picture, although the comparisons here come with caveats - for instance, that Switch has a far higher userbase than either GameCube or Wii U - and this game has seen heavy promotion in Japan in particular.

In this TikTok clip from 2021, Fantano reacts to a video of someone else cutting a pizza up into smaller and smaller pieces. "It's enough slices!", the exasperated Fantano shouts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday saw the release of Desert Treasure 2 - The Fallen Empire in Old School RuneScape - the MMO's first Grandmaster quest since 2019.
A sequel to the classic Desert Treasure quest released back in 2005, Desert Treasure 2 - The Fallen Empire sends players back to the depths of the Kharidian Desert to explore a vault connected to the fallen Zarosian empire where they'll once again get caught in the plans of the mysterious Mahjarrat. 
As many RuneScape players will know, the lore in Old School RuneScape frequently deviates from the stories told in its modern counterpart due to its being created from an August 2007 archive. This means any quests released after this date, King's Ransom being the last, are not present in Old School RuneScape, allowing the developers to not only craft stories unique to Old School, but to take the ones which overlap in a different direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil 4 recently got a remake, but now it's time to take things to a different perspective. May I present a fan modded side-scrolling demake of Capcom's Las Plagas infected game to fulfil all our survival horror needs.


This demake comes from DooMero, and is known as the Resident Evil 4 2D Edition. It was created on GZDoom, an engine and modding tool often used for various Doom creations. In fact, the DooMero has dedicated their creation to the Doom community. 


Earlier this week the creator uploaded a 30 minute video showing the opening moments of their Resident Evil 4 demake. It all starts as you would expect, with Leon Kennedy (and his lovely jacket) searching for the president's daughter in the unnamed rural village in Spain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of the Emerald Powers in Sonic Superstars have been revealed, as well as details on its Special Stages.


As with previous 2D Sonic games, Chaos Emeralds are acquired in the game's Special Stages. Now, each Emerald will grant players a special ability to be used throughout the zones.


The idea behind this was to give players smaller rewards, where in previous games a reward was given only once all Chaos Emeralds are acquired (usually Super Sonic).

Gaming revenue overall increased by 1% ($36m) driven by growth in Xbox content and services, but this was offset by the decline in console sales. Content and services revenue increased by five percent due to third-party content and Xbox Game Pass.


Indeed, the company set a new fourth quarter record for monthly active Game Pass users and engagement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has reportedly cancelled its plans to release an Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel.


Word of a follow up to 2020's mythological romp first surfaced last year, when it was reported a game was in the pre-production stages, with Ubisoft hiring for the title. Subsequent reports then suggested this game would not, in fact, be a fully fledged sequel, but rather a spin-off with a Hawaiian Polynesian theme.


Now it seems the company has decided to pull the plug on this project all together. Sources familiar with Immortals Fenyx Rising's supposed sequel told VGC the Quebec studio's game is no longer in the works due to "perceived challenges around establishing the IP". Allegedly, Ubisoft instead wants to shift its focus to its "most prominent brands".

The upcoming Chrono Trigger inspired retro RPG from Sabotage Studio will launch on 29th August, when it will also be available on Xbox Game Pass, as well as Switch and PC. 


The impending launch of Sea of Stars on PlayStation Plus is notable, as Sony seldom releases games day one on its subscription service. To date, only a handful of other titles have been included as part of PS Plus on their release, such as Stray and Tchia. Meanwhile, the company has said it still won't put new first-party games on PlayStation Plus day one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has said negative comments from trolls online are "tiresome".


A special documentary on the developer was recently shown in Japan, which streamer and Final Fantasy fan Audrey of Aitai Kimochi translated for social media.


During the show, Yoshida stated he often checks social media for fan feedback during breaks between Final Fantasy 14 expansions and events. He was also shown watching fan videos ahead of the release of Final Fantasy 16 to understand fan sentiment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Bethesda remaining largely quiet about its upcoming space-opera, one excited Starfield fan has taken matters into their own hands and compiled a speculatory skill system for the game. 


As reported by GamesRadar, asd8dhd on Reddit has spent 200 hours trawling through the various gameplay clips, trailers, and other Starfild-focused media to create what they believe will be the game's complete skill tree.


"I must have watched the direct in its entirety around 50-60 times, often at ultra-slow speeds in order to capture specific details and verify certain information. I have also watched other videos and interviews many times, and have typed up enough notes to last me about 100 years," the Redditor shared along with their theories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Entertainment Software Rating Board has proposed a new verification mechanism which it says will ensure parental consent is properly obtained under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule (COPPA).

The board, which regulates age ratings for games in the US and Canada, has developed the mechanism with Yoti, a digital ID platform, and SuperAwesome, a company specialising in online child safety tools. SuperAwesome was acquired by Epic Games in 2020.

According to COPPA, services in the US must gain parental consent to collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The ERSB's proposal, titled "Privacy-Protective Facial Age Estimation", would use facial recognition software to verify the age of the parent. If their estimated age is lower than the threshold (given as 25 in the proposal), they would not be allowed to provide consent for the child.

The controller has four different designs - one for each of the titular turtles - but more importantly each will come with a "built-in scent diffuser" in the shape of a pizza slice.

Thankfully (or sadly, if you're a fan of TMNT and/or desire the constant smell of pizza in your life) the controller is only available through a giveaway being hosted by Xbox. In order to enter, you'll need to follow Xbox Game Pass on Twitter and retweet its sweepstakes tweet which, at time of writing, isn't live yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside the confirmation of which characters will appear in Mortal Kombat 1's first DLC, three more playable characters have been confirmed.
Long-time characters Baraka, Tanya, and Li Mei are all returning to the main roster of the reboot. Whilst Baraka was playable in the most recent game in the series, Mortal Kombat 11, Tanya last appeared as a playable character in Mortal Kombat 10 as DLC. Li Mei, despite appearing as a NPC in Mortal Kombat 10, hasn't been playable since 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.
Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has discussed some of the differences in these characters' stories in this rebooted universe.

"The goal for Steamforged was to seamlessly blend Voyage of Legends with the Sea of Thieves environment, making the game board, cards, and tokens feel at home on a tavern table in an outpost. The board game itself serves as a familiar hub where players can track their progress and house the various cards needed to become a pirate legend."

<p>It&#8217;s completely hypnotic to watch these tiny cells flash with color. It&#8217;s as if the squid has a little sky full of twinkling stars on its skin. This has to be one of the coolest looking sea creatures I&#8217;ve seen.</p></blockquote>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has commented on the sales of Final Fantasy 16, claiming they have been "extremely strong".


As previously reported, the PS5 exclusive sold 3m copies worldwide in under a week. However this sparked debate online in comparison to the company's previous two mainline Final Fantasy games: Final Fantasy 15 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake.



Square Enix has now issued a statement to IGN, pointing out the difference in install base between the PS4 and PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Epic Game Store's weekly freebies continue, this time pummelling the price of The Elder Scrolls Online and acclaimed puzzler Murder by Numbers down to an affordable zero pence.


The Elder Scrolls Online likely needs no introduction, not least because all the pertinent details are right there in the title. If you're still struggling though, it's an MMO - first released in 2014 - that whisks players to Tamriel for some fantasy japery.


If dragon nonsense isn't your thing, then your other option is Murder by Numbers, a lovely blend of campy detective mystery and - of all things - Picross, as players whizz back to the mid-90s in the role of Honor Mizhari, an actress on a hit TV detective show who's suddenly required to do some real-world investigating when her boss is found dead.

        <updated>2023-07-20T21:47:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly preparing to pause its upcoming in-house trial focussing on Microsoft's proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard, potentially paving the way for settlement talks between the various parties.


The FTC has long expressed opposition to Microsoft's proposed deal and sued to block its progress in December last year, claiming the acquisition would allow the company to suppress its games industry competition. The agency has more recently been in the news after it failed to secure an injunction preventing Microsoft from closing the deal while its in-house court deliberated whether the acquisition should be blocked.


Following that defeat, and a subsequent failed attempt to secure injunctive relief, the FTC is preparing to suspend its own trial - which was due to be heard by its in-house administrative court in August - in response to a request from Microsoft and Activision. Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the case, says the request must be granted after the FTC's unsuccessful federal court bid under the agency's own rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a first look back in May, Sony Pictures Entertainment has shared a second trailer offering another glimpse at its Neill Blomkamp directed Gran Turismo movie - which is almost upon us, launching in cinemas next month.


Sony's live-action Gran Turismo movie was announced in spring last year, as part of a string of reveals for upcoming PlayStation game adaptations, with others including a Horizon Zero Dawn series for Netflix and a God of War show for Amazon.


Since then, Neill Blomkamp (who directed District 9, Elysium, Chappie, and more) has signed up to helm the project - which dramatises the true story of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills put him on the path toward becoming a professional racecar driver - with the likes of Archie Madekwe, David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Geri Halliwell all joining the cast.

The emulator was first announced to be coming to Steam earlier this year, with the team behind it calling this a "product of many months of work".

However, a few months down the line, the team has dropped plans to launch Dolphin on Valve's platform. In a blog update detailing this decision, the Dolphin team addressed the recently-reported DMCA takedown, stating Nintendo "did not send Valve or Dolphin a Digital Millennium Copyright Act", nor has it "taken any legal action against Dolphin Emulator or Valve".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Sleep players with access to the game's £50 Pokémon Go Plus+ peripheral are pretending to sleep in order to quickly speed towards Pokémon Go rewards. 


The new nap-tracking app requires you record at least 90 minutes of sleep per day - and it's this minimum which users are now recording, before manually changing the date on their phones to then record another 90 minutes, and so forth. 


Repeating this method allows you to rack up rewards for recording a week's worth of sleep (albeit no less than 90 minutes at a time) in just a few hours, users writing on Pokémon fan reddit TheSilphRoad say. And doing so seems fairly straightforward, with the app's sleep sensor simply turned off and on without you actually having to be asleep.

A free-to-play hero shooter set in the world of the popular anime, Gundam Evolution arrived on Steam last September, with a console version then following in December. 


However, Gundam Evolution evidently hasn't taken off in the way the developer had hoped, with Bandai Namco Online now announcing its service will end on 29th November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Patrick's Parabox, the indie recursive puzzle game, will launch on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 next week on 26th July.
Despite scooping the prize for Excellence in Design at the Independent Games Festival in 2020, the game made a relatively small splash when it first released last year for PC.
Patrick's Parabox is a sokoban mixed with recursion, filled with boxes inside of boxes. You play as Patrick, a small box, and you push around boxes to where they need to go. Sometimes, you push around boxes which contain the puzzle you're actually in, and then you can enter that box. The trailer below probably sums it up better than I could in words.

<blockquote><p>So far, at least three trends emerge:</p>
<p>First, the plan contains a (somewhat) more concrete list of actions than its parent strategy, with useful delineation of lead and supporting agencies, as well as timelines aplenty. By assigning each action a designated lead and timeline, and by including a new nominal section (6) focused entirely on assessing effectiveness and continued iteration, the ONCD suggests that this is not so much a standalone text as the framework for an annual, crucially iterative policy process. That many of the milestones are still hazy might be less important than the commitment. the administration has made to revisit this plan annually, allowing the ONCD team to leverage their unique combination of topical depth and budgetary review authority...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 recently made headlines when it was reported the game would have 17,000 ending variations. It's a claim that comes from an interview with one of the game's lead writers by YouTuber Fextralife, and related specifically to the differences which might flavour the more general core paths to the game's ending.


Lead writer Adam Smith has now shed further light on these variations, and further confirmed they don't  equate to endgame states. Rather, Baldur's Gate 3's narrative should be thought of as a "big spider web", he said, with the endgame in the centre. 


"It's not that you start at point A, and then you keep branching and branching and branching," Smith explained to GamesRadar. "That's often how people think of it, but the problem with that would be that if I make a choice, then I branch over here, and suddenly I'm over here and I can't get back [to the trunk]."

Subscriptions were up by 5.9m since March, BBC News reported, presenting a far rosier picture than the losses faced this time last year.


In a statement, Netflix said it had seen a "healthy conversion of borrower households" into paid accounts, and that the number of account cancellations in protest at the changes had been low.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard's latest financial earnings report has arrived, and while it's good news for the company as a whole, Blizzard in particular has had a stellar quarter, surpassing $1bn USD in net bookings for the first time ever thanks to the launch of Diablo 4.


In its second quarter earnings report for the latest financial year, Activision Blizzard announced 50% year-over-year growth in net bookings, with the company amassing $2.46bn compared to the $1.64bn it reported in the second quarter of 2022.


That's down to a mix of increased "player investment in live operations content" across games such as Call of Duty, which rose by 17%, and "another quarterly net bookings record at King". The big applause, though, is reserved for Diablo 4, which, as of the end of Blizzard's record-breaking second quarter - which saw the studio's segment revenue grow by 160% year-over-year and its operating revenue more than triple - has "sold-through more units than any other Blizzard title at an equivalent stage of release."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard is taking its first tentative steps away from Battle.net exclusivity, starting with the launch of Overwatch 2 on Steam this August and the promise of more games on the way.


Battle.net has been at the core of Blizzard's games since its release back in 1996, and the studio's PC titles have remained exclusively available through the platform in the years since, making it one of the few companies to have entirely snubbed Steam.


That will change on 10th August when Blizzard's free-to-play shooter sequel Overwatch 2 arrives on Valve's storefront, where it'll incorporate native features including Steam Achievements and Steam friends list integration. And perhaps we might even see official Steam Deck support on the way? Blizzard does note, however, that players will still be required to connect the game to a Battle.net account to enable features including cross-platform play.
