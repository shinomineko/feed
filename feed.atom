The announcement was made as part of a PlayStation blog post rounding up a raft of indie games coming to the consoles.


We're big fans of FuturLab's Powerwash Simulator here at Eurogamer, and have written about it extensively. You clean dirt off stuff, essentially. It's satisfying, therapeutic and weirdly tricky at times. You can even go prone like an MLG powerwash pro to get right under those hard to reach bits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an inglorious end to his career at Manchester United and, perhaps, his national team Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo has left elite level football for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr and a contract reportedly worth up to €200m (£177m) a year. And with the move comes an inevitable - some would say long overdue - FIFA rating downgrade.


37-year-old Ronaldo, who for years had been one of the two best cards in the FIFA games alongside World Cup winner Lionel Messi, had already dropped three positions for the FIFA 23 top 10 with a 90-rated card. Now, after Ronaldo's poor performance at the World Cup and his move to the Saudi Pro League, EA has knocked Ronaldo down a further peg to his lowest rating since 2007, when the forward broke through at Manchester United.


Ronaldo's overall rating is now 88, two lower than the 90 he started FIFA 23 with back in September. Crucially, his specific stats are also lower. His dribbling, for example, is down to 81 from 84, his stamina down to 70 from 74.

In a forum post, programmer and co-designer Tarn Adams declared Dwarf Fortress' Steam launch, which came after 16 years of free availability, a "wild success". Dwarf Fortress is also sitting on an "overwhelmingly positive" user review rating on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lawsuit between Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red and its investors has been settled for $1.85m.


The game was released in a notoriously buggy state, particularly on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which led to a complaint filed in December 2020 that alleged the developer misled both customers and investors on how playable the game was.

In December, Microsoft claimed the FTC's lawsuit against its Activision Blizzard buyout was unconstitutional, and specifically violated the Fifth Amendment.


However, the company has now gone back on this argument, admitting it "should have dropped these defences before we filed".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2 will be "faithful to the original title" while also modernising areas that haven't aged as well. 


That's according to Bloober Team's marketing chief Anna Jasińska in an interview with DreadXP.


Asked about the extent the studio was given free reign by Konami to transform the game with its own vision, Jasińska said: "We are focusing on bringing the distinct, visceral atmosphere back in the modernised Silent Hill 2. Longtime fans shouldn’t worry about us 'missing the point' while we’re livening up the title. We faithfully stick to the traditional story canon while remaking the gameplay and updating the graphics from the ground up."

I heard rumours it had returned so went to double check for myself, and, sure enough, when I typed the game's name into Game Pass I was soon greeted with a tired looking knight (or Shell) looking back at me. 


Mortal Shell is a Dark-Souls inspired action RPG from Cold Symmetry, with the developer stating it will "test your sanity and resilience".

Shared as part of CES 2023, this trailer shows off the game with Nvidia's latest ray tracing tech in play. It's a bite-sized little teaser that begins with a few sweeping shots showing the destruction and destitution left in The Day Before's version of a post-pandemic America. 


It then cuts to scenes of the player character shooting down their enemies, engaging in stealthy trips into darkened rooms and along questionable corridors, and, of course, a swarming zombie horde. You can see it for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti graphics card goes on sale today, offering largely RTX 3090 to 3090 Ti level performance at $799 in the US and £799 in the UK. That's the narrative, anyway - but how many cards will actually be available at the MSRP/RRP? 
It's an important question, because as the old saying goes, there are no bad products, just bad prices. The RTX 4070 Ti is quite a strong option at $799, given its level of performance - particularly for those upgrading from Pascal (GTX 10-series) and Turing (20-series) GPUs or AMD's equivalents. At $899 or $999 though, this graphics card starts to make much less sense. 
And with no Founders Edition cards available, we're relying on third-party GPU makers to create SKUs that meet that price point - when it would be much more profitable for them to offer overclocked designs with oversized coolers and RGB bling for $50, $100 or $200 more. In fact, it's these sorts of cards that seem to have been sent out for review, including our unit which offered a paltry 30MHz overclock over stock - but came with a higher price tag to match.

The $7.7m lawsuit was filed last year due to a number of false copyright takedowns sent to Destiny 2 players in March. In June the perpetrator was identified as Nicholas Minor a.k.a Lord Nazo.




At the time, Bungie alleged that Minor launched a "malicious campaign to serve fraudulent takedown notices to some of the most prominent and passionate members of that fanbase, purportedly on Bungie's behalf, in apparent retaliation for Bungie enforcing its copyrights against material Minor uploaded to his own YouTube channel".

Smaller clubs like Wrexham aren't normally featured in FIFA, but the club entered the game in FIFA 22 in the "Rest of the World" category, likely due to the novelty of Reynolds and McElhenney being the new owners. 


Wrexham then returned for FIFA 23, only this time, players have found some trash talk from Reynolds and McElhenney from the benches.

This latest update video is truly a sight to behold. Along with the Post Boxers, it also introduces us to another bot out for our blood - the Naval Walker. This is a sentient (in so much as it walks around at its own free will) mine that will chase you down. There are different types of these walkers throughout the mod, with the paint on each denoting which kind you are dealing with.

        <updated>2023-01-05T12:18:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD has announced a raft of new Ryzen processors at its CES 2023 showcase, including the long-awaited Ryzen 7000X3D processors that should provide a stern rejoinder to Intel's 13th-gen desktop CPUs and could let Team Red reclaim the gaming performance crown. 
The idea here is pretty simple: take the '3D V-Cache' technology that made AMD's last-gen Ryzen 7 5800X3D so fast that it challenged even next-gen flagship CPUs, and pair it with some of AMD's fastest Ryzen 7000 processors. The result is three new chips, the Ryzen 7800X3D, Ryzen 7900X3D and the Ryzen 7950X3D. All three come with dramatically increased cache sizes - 104MB of L2 and L3 cache on the Ryzen 7 and up to 144MB on the Ryzen 9 - which minimise the time CPUs spend waiting for data to be copied into the cache, increasing performance considerably in some games. 
In AMD-provided benchmarks, the 7800X3D was between 10 and 25 percent faster than the 5800X3D at 1080p in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Borderlands 3 and F1 22 - slightly less than I would have expected, given that the 7800X3D is also using DDR5 RAM versus the DDR4 on the 5800X3D. Perhaps a more interesting comparison is that of the 7950X3D against the 13900K, where AMD showed between a nine and 24 percent performance lead in Watchdogs Legion, Dota 2, Rainbow Six Siege and Horizon Zero Dawn.

This trailer covers a few behind the scenes shots that give us a closer look at how the film was made - things like cars rigged up with cameras left, right and centre. It also has some quotes from the film's actors, including Pirates of the Caribbean and Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom who has promised us all "body vibrating sound" that will mean viewers will feel "every jolt [and] every thrill" of the race on the film's release (which will be exclusively in theatres). 


Not that this film is going to solely focus on the cars, however. The cast has said there will be "heart-pounding action, drama [and] a love story" also woven into the script, that follows the true story of Jann Mardenborough.

PlayStation VR2 is coming out on February 22nd, with units costing a cool £530. Here's everything you need to know about PSVR2, including its launch titles and full specs - and it's a device that Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton has been very enthusiastic about since trying it for himself.

The v1.25 release of Kubernetes introduced an alpha feature to change how a default StorageClass was assigned to a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
With the feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and PVC second to assign the class. Additionally, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned can be updated later.
This feature was graduated to beta in Kubernetes 1.26.

Along with Pedro Pascal's Joel, we will see all the highs and lows these two characters go through on their perilous journey across America when the show makes its debut later this month. 


However, it turns out that before Ramsey landed the part of Ellie, fellow Game of Thrones alum Maisie Williams (who played Arya Stark) was in talks for the role back when the game was being pegged for a film adaptation.


Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann said the team needed to ensure that whoever was cast as Ellie in any adaptation would be able to appear "tough and vulnerable and wise beyond [their] years and also have a potential for violence" all at once.

This new image shows an abandoned cruise liner that, along with the rest of the world, has succumbed to the weather and decay of time. Its windows have been smashed, its hull has rusted - a far cry from its presumably once luxurious state. 


Along with this artwork, which you can see in full below, Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann stated the studio's upcoming multiplayer project is "shaping up to be a fresh, new experience". But while it may be fresh and new, Druckmann has said it will still be an experience "rooted in Naughty Dog's passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay".

It's widely known that the game was developed in under two years - an extremely short amount of time that led to huge pressure and Nintendo employees working overtime.


As unearthed from Japanese magazines by YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming, the game's writers inserted their experience of crunch into the mouths of the game's NPCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the United States government's Federal Trade Commission (hereon referred to as the FTC) has agreed for staff to engage in settlement negotiations with Microsoft regarding its ongoing efforts to purchase Activision Blizzard, "there are no substantive discussions" between the two parties being conducted "at this time."


That's coming from FTC lawyer James Weingarten, who took part in a pretrial hearing on Tuesday to discuss Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a record-breaking $69bn.


Back in December, the FTC revealed its intention to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, claiming should the deal be allowed to proceed, it would enable the company to suppress its fellow games industry competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia just wrapped up its CES press conference, unveiling a new desktop graphics card - the RTX 4070 Ti - plus a lineup of RTX 40-series GPUs for laptops and a new RTX 4080 tier for its GeForce Now streaming service. Here's what you need to know.
First, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti. This is the renamed, repriced and now relaunched version of the RTX 4080 12GB that was so roundly derided upon its announcement that Nvidia 'unlaunched' the card soon thereafter. The key to that move was a feeling of confusion from gamers and press alike that the card was too distant in price and performance from the 4080 16GB, as it wasn't even based on the same AD103 chip. 
Now, the GPU seems more sensibly positioned - as a small improvement over the popular last-gen RTX 3080, with a price to match of $799. With DLSS 3 frame generation, it can be up to three times faster than the RTX 3090 Ti while consuming nearly half the power, although we look forward to putting those claims to the test. The latest Ada Lovelace card is scheduled to launch on January 5th, so we don't have too long to wait!

Pocket Card Jockey first launched on 3DS back in 2013, and is one of Game Freak's more successful non-Pokémon  games. An intriguing mash-up of horse racing and solitaire, it's gone on to earn cult status (though I recall Eurogamer's former in-house solitaire expert Oli Welsh being charmed but not wowed by this take on the form). 


Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! - spotted by our friends at VGC - is a buffed-up re-release for Apple Arcade,  with new 3D visuals for racing sections, and it's due out 20th January. It's got me wondering what other 3DS gems are ripe for being rescued by new ports - is it too much to hope for a re-release of Attack of the Friday Monsters?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart is no longer involved in Netflix's upcoming Assassin's Creed adaptation. 


Stuart's involment with the project was first announced back in 2021. However, speaking to Collider earlier this month, the screenwriter revealed he is no longer a showrunner on the adaptation due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives. 


"I think it was a little bit of a move of executives from LA to London, and it allowed the London group who, unfortunately, had to inherit my vision of what it was instead of getting to develop their own vision," Stuart explained to the publication.

Sharing an update earlier today, Nightdive revealed the "scope and scale" of the project has "evolved dramatically" over the past few years. This, in part, is thanks to publisher Prime Matter joining the project.


With this publisher on board, Nightdive Studios has been able to "focus on quality-of-life improvements, bug fixing, and localisation support", things it calls "the last major steps towards releasing a game we're all incredibly proud of".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ken Block, star of Codemasters' Dirt series and a figure whose passion for motorsports helped push it to new audiences, has died at the age of 55 following a snowmobile accident on his ranch in Utah.

Block was an entrepreneur who co-founded DC Shoes in 1994, using his success to help pursue his automotive passions. In the 00s Block became a professional rally driver who went on to participate in the sport at its highest level in the WRC, though his results - with only a small handful of points and no podiums to show for his 24 appearances between 2007 and 2018 - don't reflect his true legacy as he popularised the sport through his hugely successful series of Gymkhana videos. 
WRC legend Sébastien Ogier led the many tributes to the great man. "Ken was a visionary, so passionate and inspiring," the eight-time WRC champion said on Twitter. "He knew like no other how to combine motorsport and a big show. He lived his life to the fullest and I'll never forget his smile and laugh."

The trailer in question, which begins with a poignant reminder this game was made in Ukraine, can be seen below. While we still don't have a firm release date for Stalker 2 as yet, the developer once more promises a 2023 launch as part of the trailer's official description.

Meanwhile, it is steadily ending support for a selection of its games, making the company's offerings a much leaner dish for consumers (and perhaps potential buyers?).


In his recent New Year's letter, Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda stated 2023 will be a year of "major evolution and transformation" for the company, with "multiple blockchain games based on original IPs under development" at this time. Some of these, Matsuda noted, have already been announced, while others will be unveiled at a later date.

Kubernetes v1.26, released last month, introduced an alpha feature that
lets you specify a data source for a PersistentVolumeClaim, even where the source
data belong to a different namespace.
With the new feature enabled, you specify a namespace in the dataSourceRef field of
a new PersistentVolumeClaim. Once Kubernetes checks that access is OK, the new
PersistentVolume can populate its data from the storage source specified in that other
namespace.
Before Kubernetes v1.26, provided your cluster had the AnyVolumeDataSource feature enabled,
you could already provision new volumes from a data source in the same
namespace.
However, that only worked for the data source in the same namespace,
therefore users couldn't provision a PersistentVolume with …]]></summary>

<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eavesdropping from the user&#8217;s smartphone is a well-known threat to the user&#8217;s safety and privacy. Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.26 includes significant advancements in network traffic engineering with the graduation of
two features (Service internal traffic policy support, and EndpointSlice terminating conditions) to GA,
and a third feature (Proxy terminating endpoints) to beta. The combination of these enhancements aims
to address short-comings in traffic engineering that people face today, and unlock new capabilities for the future.
Traffic Loss from Load Balancers During Rolling Updates
Prior to Kubernetes v1.26, clusters could experience loss of traffic
from Service load balancers during rolling updates when setting the externalTrafficPolicy field to Local.

The Kubernetes 1.26 release includes a stable implementation of the Job
controller that can reliably track a large amount of Jobs with high levels of
parallelism. SIG Apps
and WG Batch
have worked on this foundational improvement since Kubernetes 1.22. After
multiple iterations and scale verifications, this is now the default
implementation of the Job controller.
Paired with the Indexed completion mode,
the Job controller can handle massively parallel batch Jobs, supporting up to
100k concurrent Pods.
The new implementation also made possible the development of Pod failure policy,
which is in beta in the 1.26 release.
How do I use this feature?
To use Job tracking with finalizers, upgrade to Kubernetes 1.25 or newer and

Remember when Nintendo released its first update for Mario Kart 7 in 10 years? Well, it turns out that was to address a critical exploit that "could allow an attacker to achieve full console takeover".

Whilst the issue was reportedly first noted back in 2021, PabloMK7, Rambo6Glaz, Fishguy6564 have been credited with the discovery of "ENLBufferPwn", an exploit so serious, it was given a critical score of 9.8/10 in the CVSS 3.1 calculator.

"This past year was the biggest year in Sonic history, including the release of the movie sequel, new titles Sonic Origins and Sonic Frontiers, and the Netflix animation Sonic Prime," Sonic Team's Iizuka told Famitsu (thanks, Gematsu and Nintendo Life).

According to the Instagram account of PromoBricks - a Lego site that's successfully revealed unconfirmed Lego sets ahead of time before - the sets vary in size and complexity and will cost between $30 and $100 (that's £25 to £82, although the final localised price may differ).

Beyond that, however, not much else is known, but you can get a sneaky peek at what the sets may entail in the image shared by PromoBricks (thanks, VGC).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve's new Steam Replay feature is here with a handy summary of your 2022 PC playtime.

Just like PlayStation's annual Wrap-Up feature, Steam Replay tots up "all of your playtime between the first second of January 1 and the last second of December 14 (GMT)" - albeit only the games you've played whilst online; offline play and time spent "running tools" is not included - and presents it as a convenient infographic.

As well as a highlight panel that shows how much time you've spent on the games that have kept you busiest over the last 12 months (for me, it's been indie ghosthunting hit Phasmophobia), you also get a summary of your achievements - including the "rare" ones - and your longest streak, as well as data that lets you know how you compare with the rest of Steam's community.

In an interview with the New Yorker (thanks, Comicbook), Druckmann said he hoped that the show will "put that video-game curse to bed", although screenwriter Craig Mazin acknowledged that it's "not the highest bar in the world" to become a great adaptation given some games, like Assassin's Creed, have "impenetrable" storylines.

"I love the ability to wander, to do nothing, in Skyrim," Mazin said, before adding that "that is not translatable!" By contrast, however, he said that "The Last of Us was always a story where the story comes first".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has hit back at Sony's objection to its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard by revealing that third-party games like Bloodborne, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Final Fantasy 16, and Silent Hill 2 Remake are party to "exclusion" agreements that will prevent those games from coming to Xbox consoles.

The news comes as part of Microsoft's response to the FTC's lawsuit against its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In the filing, Microsoft defends its position by turning the spotlight back onto Sony, detailing a handful of "prominent" games the company alleges have been barred from release on Xbox.

Whilst the filing acknowledges that "exclusivity strategies are not uncommon in the games industry", Microsoft seems to take issue with Sony's partnerships with third-party publishers, namely From Software, Square Enix, and Konami.

The CPU Manager is a part of the kubelet, the Kubernetes node agent, which enables the user to allocate exclusive CPUs to containers.
Since Kubernetes v1.10, where it graduated to Beta, the CPU Manager proved itself reliable and
fulfilled its role of allocating exclusive CPUs to containers, so adoption has steadily grown making it a staple component of performance-critical
and low-latency setups. Over time, most changes were about bugfixes or internal refactoring, with the following noteworthy user-visible changes:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author: Wei Huang (Apple), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google)
Kubernetes 1.26 introduced a new Pod feature: scheduling gates. In Kubernetes, scheduling gates
are keys that tell the scheduler when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.
What problem does it solve?
When a Pod is created, the scheduler will continuously attempt to find a node that fits it. This
infinite loop continues until the scheduler either finds a node for the Pod, or the Pod gets deleted.
Pods that remain unschedulable for long periods of time (e.g., ones that are blocked on some external event)
waste scheduling cycles. A scheduling cycle may take ≅20ms or more depending on the complexity of
the Pod's scheduling constraints. Therefore, at scale, those wasted cycles significantly impact the
scheduler's performance. See …]]></summary>

Now almost two months on, players fear the Valderas Museum will never return. Season One saw the return of fan favourite maps Shoothouse and Shipment, but players criticised the paltry number of maps released. One wonders why Infinity Ward hasn't released a map that is seemingly complete and ready to ship. 


But players have taken it upon themselves to answer this question. Some have noticed the map's striking resemblance to the real-life Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal goes all the way back to 2018, when former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie disclosed to The Guardian and The New York Times that the UK-based company had scraped extensive data from Facebook without the explicit consent of users. 


The scandal led to investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and the UK's Information Commissioner's Office issuing a £500,000 fine to Facebook (this was before the GDPR had come into force, which allows for significantly higher financial penalties) and the US' Federal Trade Commission issuing a $5bn fine.

The headline here is the addition of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, which came out in November 2019 and is set to get a sequel, Jedi Survivor, in March. The addition of Fallen Order to PS Plus Essential next month is well-timed in that context.


Elsewhere, Bethesda's online-focused RPG Fallout 76 joins PS Plus Essential next month (it's already in the PlayStation Plus Extra tier). Just yesterday we reported on how Fallout 76 has an impressive 13.5m players four years after its disastrous launch. I imagine joining PS Plus Essential will only fuel the player count.

Also, like EternalBlue, it&#8217;s wormable, meaning that a single exploit can trigger a chain reaction of self-replicating follow-on exploits on other vulnerable systems. The wormability of EternalBlue allowed WannaCry and several other attacks to spread across the world in a matter of minutes with no user interaction required...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

While the game will remain playable and rankings will continue without the use of prize pass levels, no new characters or maps will be released, effectively ending support following the conclusion of Season 5.


Meanwhile, sales of mythril, Chocobo GP's premium currency, have been discontinued. The in-game mythril shop will disappear on 6th January. All purchased mythril becomes "invalid" then, too. Square Enix said it will not issue refunds for purchased mythril.

As you may already have assumed, Asmussen said it will be "advantageous to use certain types of stances against certain types of enemies". This, the director says, will require the player to "break down the enemies and figure out what the best weapon of choice is".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Goat Simulator 3 developer Coffee Stain North has been issued with a take-down notice by the powers that be at Take-Two, after it used leaked GTA 6 footage in a recent trailer.

The now-deleted Tweets included a video of Ferdinand discussing the upcoming Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid, with the accompanying next: "Here's who I think will be taking home the [trophy emoji] … Class Day down at #PlayStationHouse ahead of the #UCLFinalv … @PlayStation #PlayStationPartner."


A second Tweet included a series of images showing Ferdinand take part in various activities at PlayStation House, which appears to be a popup social event for influencers ahead of the Champions League final.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed further details of its new DualSense Edge wireless controller for the PlayStation 5, but one particular point stuck out the most. 


In a hand-on preview, The Verge noticed that battery life was noticeably worse than the base DualSense controller, and this was later confirmed to the publication in a statement. 


"The DualSense Edge wireless controller's operating time is moderately shorter than the original DualSense wireless controller," a Sony spokesperson said. "We wanted to strike a good balance between wireless operating time and delivering robust, high-performance features."

This version of the game will include a new Arenas mode, which will also arrive as a free update for PC via the Epic Games Store and on PlayStation at the same time.


Details of what this new offering will include are thin on the ground at the moment - a trailer for the update promises nine maps which will unlock new modifiers and alternate moves, additional cheats and fresh outfits. It sounds like they'll be worth playing!

According to the patch notes, the hotfix should "improve overall stability and performance of the game, and fix GOG & Steam overlays." 


Stability and performance improvements is of course the catch-all phrase used by developers to group a large number of small fixes, but we do know from reports of PC users that problems included framerate drops and slow texture loading.

Sundae Month and publisher Kitfox Games announced this news as part of Nintendo's House of Indies: Holiday Event yesterday, promising Switch owners that soon they will be able to use their photography skills to snap all the best shots of shibas, terriers, labs, pugs, and more. "You want 'em, WE GOT EM!" the Pupperazzi team proclaimed.


But it is not just taking pictures. Along with getting nice photos of your canine compatriots, you will also be able to play fetch with them, dress them up in a variety of outfits, have a dance party (or should that be paw-ty) with them and "terrorise them with vacuum cleaners" (but would you really want to do that?). You can even see them in action at the skatepark - in fact, Pupperazzi's entire world is populated with dogs, dogs and yet more dogs. You can see what I mean in the trailer below.

Squanch Games and Justin Roiland's effort is now the most popular game in Microsoft's subscription - in both its PC and console catalogues. 


On Xbox consoles, more people are playing High on Life through Game Pass than other popular titles such as Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, FIFA 22 and Rainbow Six Siege. Indeed, it is currently being played by more people than any first-party Microsoft release, including Minecraft, Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite and Sea of Thieves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A major new study from UK consumer group Which? has found evidence that the Nintendo Switch's infamous Joy-Con drift is likely caused by a mechanical fault, pointing to fundamental design flaws.


The research found that the Joy-Con's plastic circuit boards showed noticeable wear on the joystick slider contact points, despite only being used for months. It is this wear that ultimately results in drifting. 


In addition, dust and other contaminants were found in the Switch's internal components, despite attempts by Nintendo at dustproofing said areas.

In Kubernetes 1.26, the 1st alpha release of validating admission policies is

Validating admission policies use the Common Expression
Language (CEL) to offer a declarative,
in-process alternative to validating admission
webhooks.
CEL was first introduced to Kubernetes for the Validation rules for
CustomResourceDefinitions.
This enhancement expands the use of CEL in Kubernetes to support a far wider
range of admission use cases.
Admission webhooks can be burdensome to develop and operate. Webhook developers
must implement and maintain a webhook binary to handle admission requests. Also,
admission webhooks are complex to operate. Each webhook must be deployed,
monitored and have a well defined upgrade and rollback plan. To make matte…]]></summary>

The eye-opening judgment includes the largest-ever settlement obtained by the FTC regarding the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, as Fortnite allowed in-game chat and user data collection by default. 


Fortnite holds a "Teen" rating by the US ratings board ESRB, but the FTC has argued Epic Games knew many of its users were likely under 13 years of age and had not obtained their parents' consent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has used its FIFA series to correctly predict the winner of the World Cup for fourth consecutive time. 


The entire tournament was simulated inside FIFA 23, which outputted Argentina as the ultimate winners, with Lionel Messi winning the Golden Boot and Emi Martínez winning the Golden Glove awards. The predictions were published November 8th, long before the tournament had started.

EA's mega-successful football series is a frequent winner of the Christmas number one crown, and last week likely saw a further boost in sales due to the attention surrounding the controversial World Cup in Qatar.


FIFA games have now taken the Christmas top spot 10 times since sales records began back in 1984, making it the most popular Christmas number one franchise (versus Call of Duty's nine Christmas chart toppers).

The Device Plugin framework was introduced in the Kubernetes v1.8 release as a vendor

With the recent release of Kubernetes v1.26, Device Manager is now generally

Within the kubelet, the Device Manager facilitates communication with device plugins

An unsourced screenshot, written in Spanish and shared on ResetEra (via VGC), alleges that Microsoft is surveying players and exploring a tier-like system - similar to that of Ubisoft+ and Sony's PS Plus - by inviting them to "consider hypothetical subscriptions".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playtest footage reportedly taken from Assassin's Creed Jade has leaked online.

Allegedly posted to an Assassin's Creed Facebook page and then, in turn, shared with Assassin's Creed and Gaming Leaks and Rumours on Reddit, the footage - which runs for 2.40 mins - was seemingly captured on an Apple mobile device and depicts a combat-heavy sequence, which includes cut-scenes and combat tutorials. You can watch it here. 

Whilst it's not the first we've seen of Jade - Ubisoft dropped a polished teaser earlier this year - it is the first time we've seen raw footage like this (thanks, TheGamer). As always, you can't necessarily expect the final product to look and/or play this way - this is likely a very, very early version of the game - and, as always, if you're interested, you should probably check it out sooner rather than later: these things have a habit of disappearing within a day or two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Double Fine boss Tim Schafer has revealed he avoids "a grab bag of stereotypes" to make his games more inclusive and avoid "hurting people".

In an interview with NME, Schafer revealed that when he started making games back in the '80s, there was "a lot less sensitivity" around, but between developing 2005's Psychonauts and its 2021 sequel, he'd "learned a lot" and was "thinking about how [his] art will be interpreted by the viewer".

"I thought I'd learned a lot, and then we tested a game, and people pointed out a word and asked if we knew what this word means to certain people," the Schafer said. "I had no idea – and people will criticise that and say 'woke culture, PC police' and stuff – but for any art, I'm thinking about how my art will be interpreted by the viewer.

As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Criterion's vice president and general manager Matt Webster has left the studio after 23 years, as has head of studio development and 17-year Criterion veteran Alan McDairmant.


They're joined by senior technical director Andrei Shires, who has been with the company for 16 years, as well as executive producer Pete Lake, who first joined Criterion in 1996. Head of content Steve Uphill also leaves following his most recent 10-year stint at Criterion. All are said to have left the developer to "explore new opportunities outside of EA".

Kubernetes v1.24 introduced an alpha quality implementation of improvements
for handling a non-graceful node shutdown.
In Kubernetes v1.26, this feature moves to beta. This feature allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node after the original node is shut down or in a non-recoverable state, such as the hardware failure or broken OS.
What is a node shutdown in Kubernetes?
In a Kubernetes cluster, it is possible for a node to shut down. This could happen either in a planned way or it could happen unexpectedly. You may plan for a security patch, or a kernel upgrade and need to reboot the node, or it may shut down due to preemption of VM instances. A node may also shut down due to a hardware failure or a software problem.

Reports of a co-op component for the Horizon series first emerged in 2020, when VGC claimed the studio had initially been looking to implement the feature as part of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn before ditching it to focus on other areas. Co-op was then said to have been revived for Horizon Forbidden West, potentially as a separate mode, but again didn't make the final cut.


As confirmed by Guerilla's recruitment-focused Twitter feed, however, the studio's co-op dreams are still very much alive, with the company currently hiring for an internally developed "separate online project" in the Horizon universe. This will feature a "new cast of characters and a unique stylised look", and allow friends to "explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together".

Well, 99 actually. So writing one more in celebration of the best Elden Ring news stories of the year seemed like a fitting way to hit that hundred.


And so below is my ranked list of top 20 favourites. Before that, a big thanks to the rest of the team too for their superb coverage in news, guides, videos, and Aoife's Essential review.

Instead, the next version of Steam Deck is far more likely to see hardware improvements centered around its screen and battery capacity. 


Speaking to The Verge, Steam Deck engineers suggested Valve was keen to stick with one singal performance point for the handheld for the time being - it's simple to understand Steam Deck verified status - to avoid muddying the waters.

But on the bright side, his lovely dog's now in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, courtesy of its new-gen update.


Henry Cavill's dog, an American Akita named Kal, is a bit of a star in his own right, frequently snapped alongside the actor and apparently a bit of a fixture on-set of Cavill's projects. During filming of The Witcher, for instance, Kal was said to have been on location the "entire time". 


And now Kal has been immortalised in digital form, appearing at the Devil's Pit for players that get the "good" ending in The Witcher 3's new quest In The Eternal Fire's Shadow, introduced as part of CD Projekt's long-in-the-works new-gen update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years after announcing his departure from Blizzard Entertainment, and his retirement from the games industry at large, long-serving Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen is returning to the company as creative advisor on the Warcraft franchise.


Metzen's retirement from Blizzard in 2016 came as a shock to many a fan. He'd been with the company for 23 years at that point, serving as head writer and lore guru (or, more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) and had become one of its most recognisable faces across countless BlizzCons.


"The reason I use the word 'retire'", Metzen explained in a statement at the time of his departure, "is because I'm not going to some other company or starting up new projects or anything remotely like that. It's been a long, amazing stretch of years. Now it's time to slow it down. Rest. Lay around on the couch and get fat."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima's idiosyncratic post-apocalyptic courier adventure Death Stranding is the latest in an increasingly long line of video games to get the movie treatment, courtesy of a newly announced collaboration between Kojima Productions and Barbarian executive producer Alex Lebovici's Hammerstone Studios.


Death Stranding, for those unfamiliar, stars The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier trying to make ends meet in an aggressively wet corner of rural Wales. One day, his clothes unexpectedly fall off, a baby turns into goo, ...fish?! Then, walking!!!!


Okay, so that's not exactly how it goes (although it's not not, either) but it's fair to say Death Stranding's atmospheric tale of a post-apocalyptic United States - which, yes, does look at awful lot like Wales - is not short of wonderfully outlandish ideas. There are eerily invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, a mysterious plane of existence known as the Beach, and much, much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insomniac has confirmed Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the eagerly awaited sequel to 2018's acclaimed open-world swing-em-up - will arrive on PS5 next "fall".


That's not, admittedly, anywhere close to being an actual launch date, but at least fans can now update their diaries and keep their anticipation in check. And the not particularly specific announcement may have something to do with the fact the "fall 2023" release was leaked earlier this week after a writer on the project added the date (since removed) to their online CV.


Official confirmation, however, has now arrived courtesy of a new post to the PlayStation Blog. "What a year it's been for PlayStation Studios," Spider-Man 2 creative director Bryan Intihar wrote as part of the news, "here at Insomniac Games we’ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers. Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022...and here’s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're in the mood for some entertainment that's both fun and free, you might like to point your browser in the direction of No Man's Sky studio Hello Games, which has just made the two mobile instalments of its very excellent arcade stunt racer series Joe Danger playable on the web for the grand total of zero pee.


More specifically, those with a hankering for some stuntery and a browser within arms reach can test their racing mettle in Joe Danger Touch and its follow-up Joe Danger Infinity, which were initially released on iOS in 2013 and 2014.


Both games, you might recall, unceremoniously vanished from the App Store in 2017, following Apple's decision to end support for 32-bit apps with iOS11. But in a lovely moment at the start of this year, they each received a surprise re-release. "It's always been a secret shame of ours that the success of No Man's Sky left Joe Danger unloved," Hello Games' Sean Murray explained at the time. "For the last two years we've had a hobby project of bringing Joe Danger back to life. Slowly rebuilding it piece by piece through eight years of Unity changes."

In a new video, Shen revealed Starfield's faction quests will be more similar to those from Bethesda's Skyrim, in the sense that players will be able to experience each faction independently. This will not be a Fallout 4 situation, which saw players being locked out of factions after joining another (something that was a bone of contention among some members of the community).


"One of the early things we decided on was making sure that the main quest actually kind of gives you a little bit of a tour of the settled systems and all of the major players there so that we can give you a taste of what they're going to be up to," Shen explained.

<p>The idea was to bring together people from a variety of disciplines who are all thinking about different aspects of democracy, less from a &#8220;what we need to do today&#8221; perspective and more from a blue-sky future perspective. My remit to the participants was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea is to start from scratch, to pretend we’re forming a new country and don’t have any precedent to deal with. And that we don’t have any unique interests to perturb our thinking. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government mid-eighteenth century politicians technology could invent.

Dynamic resource allocation is a new API for requesting resources. It is a
generalization of the persistent volumes API for generic resources, making it possible to:
access the same resource instance in different pods and containers,
attach arbitrary constraints to a resource request to get the exact resource
you are looking for,
initialize a resource according to parameters provided by the user.
Third-party resource drivers are responsible for interpreting these parameters
as well as tracking and allocating resources as requests come in.
Dynamic resource allocation is an alpha feature and only enabled when the
DynamicResourceAllocation feature

resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group are enabled. For details, see the

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the show has been in development since March and will, notably, focus on Kratos' dad years in Midgard as per 2018's God of War reboot, rather than the ultra-violent Greek-mythology-inspired adventures of Kratos' earlier games.


Here's how the show's official description teases its plot: "When his beloved wife dies, Kratos sets off on a dangerous journey with his estranged son to spread her ashes from the highest peak - his wife's final wish. Kratos soon realises the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new gods and monsters for the fate of the world."

Larian leader Swen Vinke said this during a patch pre-briefing a week ago, telling press - myself included - they'd now like to concentrate on finishing the game, which is fair enough.
No release date for Patch 9 has been communicated.

In a statement accompany today's announcement, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno referred to the unnamed project only as an "exciting new survival horror game", saying it "will help us become a leader in the horror industry at large".

However, Hungarian digital artist Zsolt Kosa actually envisioned this collaboration much, much, earlier. Perhaps, even before developer CD Projekt Red did. 


Two years ago, Kosa shared two mocked up posters of Elba in Cyberpunk 2077 to his ArtStation page. The first of these shows Elba with ice blue cyber-eyes and an impressively collared coat (as shown in this article's header image). The second shows him with some rather fancy looking sunglasses, and that same very fetching coat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Nintendo World opens at Universal Studios Hollywood on 17th February 2023.


This the second Mushroom Kingdom theme park area to open globally, following the first's opening at Universal Studios in Japan in 2021. 


The two will share a number of similar attractions, including an AR Mario Kart-themed ride, a Mario-themed cafe and exclusive merchandise. But the US version will lack its big Yoshi's Adventure ride - cut, it was previously reported, due to size issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cuphead's Delicious Last Course DLC has reached 2m sales across all platforms, Studio MDHR has announced.

The expansion pack sold 1m copies in July, just a week after it released. As we've previously reported, by 2020 the base game sold 6m copies, so it looks like the DLC is selling extremely well to its fans.

Ed loved The Delicious Last Course when he dug into it at release, which delivered on the recipe of success nailed by the original.

The patch adds ray-traced reflections when playing using the game's 30fps Fidelity Mode, allowing for details such as vehicles and characters to be shown on reflective surfaces such as windows and in water. 


Fly a helicopter past a skyscraper and you'll now see your ride reflected in its glass. Zoom along Los Santos' neon-drenched waterfront in your jet ski, and you'll be able to see its lights reflected in the waves. Neat!

But it's got a huge watermark across it. It's not like it's being used for profit, or it's going to be seen by thousands of people, so it's probably fine.
The stakes are a little different when said assignment is, say, a £50 game from a best-selling, worldwide franchise. And unfortunately for someone at Square Enix, that assignment was Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion.
Shortly after the game's release yesterday, the eagle-eyed writers over at Kotaku noticed a Getty Images watermark on one of the in-game paintings.

However, one PlayStation 1 game that many have dabbled with since its release on PlayStation Plus is Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue, the tie-in game for Pixar and Disney's 1999 animation film.  

In fact, this game is actually third on Sony's most played classic games for 2022, sitting only behind Mafia: Definitive Edition and God of War 3 Remastered. This makes it the most played PlayStation Plus PS1 game of 2022.

A long reddit thread of experiences from players writing on r/Games lists numerous experiences of frame-rate issues and long load times even on high-end PC setups - only to see them improved without the 2K Launcher active. 


Bypassing the launcher is not as simple as hitting uninstall - 2K clearly wants you to run its software as part of the game's startup. Still, the thread has a point-by-point list of instructions for those who do want to give it a go.

However, Nintendo's most recent Mario Kart update does not address MK8. Rather, it's for its predecessor - the 3DS's Mario Kart 7.


This update - or, to give it its official name, the version 1.2 update - is the first update that this game has received in a little over 10 years. Here are the full notes from Nintendo - "Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience".

To that end, Living Large moves Subnautica and its follow-up Below Zero onto unified versions of Unity, enabling the developer to implement quality of life features, fix bugs, and performance improvements in Subnautica that were already available in the more recent game.

This latest listings follows Ubisoft's announcement back in November that, having skipped Steam in favour of Epic and its own Ubisoft Connect since 2019, it would soon be bringing a select number of its games to Valve's storefront, starting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Anno 1800, and the free-to-play Roller Champions.


That initial line-up expanded by one last week with Immortals Fenyx Rising, and now Watch Dogs Legion's official January release brings Ubisoft's post-2019 Steam selection up to five.

This update will see players decking their halls with boughs of holly, thanks to a collection of new seasonal items that have been added to the game. This includes charming stockings, twinkling fairy lights, and even Santa's very own sleigh (which comes complete with its own reindeer team).


Meanwhile, thanks to the new Christmas tree additions, you could even say you will now be able to spruce your campus up a bit. After all, these decorations are tree-mendous (ok, I'll stop now).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How safe do you feel in your Valheim base? Walls secure, trenches dug out, windows sealed? Even with all these precautions in place, you may still not be safe from Valheim's new enemies. With the introduction of the Mistlands update comes a new type of raid - and this one is wreaking havoc on established player bases. Rather devastatingly, some players are losing homes that took them hundreds of hours to make. 


The new event, called "they sought you out", unleashes hordes of insects on your player base - and worse still, they can fly. Seekers and seeker soldiers are capable of hopping over ditches, then mulching stone walls like they're made of papier maché. The event can occur at any time after you've defeated the Plains boss Yagluth, so anyone who has completed Valheim's biomes is vulnerable to these attacks. And sure enough, it's taking a lot of players by surprise. 


"When we got raided we got caught off-guard and lost our three-story base which took us hundreds of hours," said one Reddit user. "It was protected with walls, trenches, and most upgraded gates - it didn't slow the seekers down at all... We all rage quit after surviving the raid, but after looking around at the aftermath, we realised any amount of rebuilding wouldn't matter because we lost seasonal item buffs for comfort level and we could not survive another raid like that."

On 7th December, Twitch announced it had added "tens of thousands" of new global charities to its charity tool for streamers. The feature was added in July in a US-only beta, and became available to all partners in August. Twitch and Paypal Giving Fund do not take a cut of donations raised through the charity tool.
"We added tens of thousands more Paypal-vetted charities from the US and dozens of different countries," Twitch stated in its blog announcement. The company came under fire from users when they discovered LGB Alliance, a UK-based hate group opposed to trans rights, was one of the new additions to Twitch's approved charities. The group was controversially granted charity status in April 2021 by the UK government.

Unlike other big PlayStation releases, it is recommended that you have a colossal 32GB of RAM available on your PC to play Returnal at its best potential. 


For comparison, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection and Horizon Zero Dawn both recommend having 16GB of RAM available - that is the minimum of what Returnal asks for. Meanwhile, God of War only asks for 8GB of RAM for the best PC experience.

That's according to Bloomberg, who cited sources familiar with the negotiations between the two companies. This deal was allegedly made as part of Microsoft's offer to Sony last month, which would see the Call of Duty series kept on PlayStation consoles for 10 years should the acquisition go through. 


Since Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard in a record-breaking deal worth $68.7bn, there have been concerns voiced about the presence of Call of Duty on other platforms.

The long-awaited day has arrived: HostProcess containers, the Windows equivalent to Linux privileged

What are HostProcess containers and why are they useful?
Cluster operators are often faced with the need to configure their nodes upon provisioning such as
installing Windows services, configuring registry keys, managing TLS certificates,
making network configuration changes, or even deploying monitoring tools such as a Prometheus's node-exporter.
Previously, performing these actions on Windows nodes was usually done by running PowerShell scripts
over SSH or WinRM sessions and/or working with your cloud provider's virtual machine management tooling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you had hoped to take refuge in your newly acquired LA Thieves operator skin while playing Warzone 2.0, well here is your heads up - as part of the game's Season 01 Reloaded update, it's about to get a whole lot more visible. 

Once upon a time, this ensemble from Call of Duty eSports team LA Thieves basically allowed wearers to become one with the shadows thanks to its all-black design (bar a red embossed "LA" on the chest). However, it has now been given a colourful little update by Activision. So, yes, we will be able to see you now. 
As Ishraq reported earlier this month, this skin by LA Thieves was labelled  "Roze 2.0", which is a reference to the Roze skin that was released for the original Warzone and Modern Warfare back in 2019. This skin was notoriously famous for making its wearer hard to see. In fact, following its release, Raven Software was forced to edit the skin to make it easier for other players to see the elusive Roze skin wearers.

However, following this year's show, many couldn't help but notice that Microsoft's offerings seemed remarkably sparse. 


In fact, all we really got was a little 'games here and games coming in 2023' teaser from the team, but nothing particularly firm. Despite this being the ideal opportunity to do so, we still have not had specific release dates announced for the likes of Starfield or Redfall - two of Xbox's biggest upcoming exclusives.

Last week, former Days Gone director John Garvin controversially stated the reason the game didn't receive universal acclaim was because of "woke reviewers" and reviewers who "couldn't be bothered to actually play the game". 

In addition to these unusual remarks, Garvin also threw the game's programmers under the bus, blaming Days Gone's "tech issues" such as "bugs, streaming and frame rate" for its middling reception.

The Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG) Release is proud to announce that we
are digitally signing all release artifacts, and that this aspect of Kubernetes
has now reached beta.
Signing artifacts provides end users a chance to verify the integrity of the
downloaded resource. It allows to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks directly on
the client side and therefore ensures the trustfulness of the remote serving the
artifacts. The overall goal of out past work was to define the used tooling for
signing all Kubernetes related artifacts as well as providing a standard signing
process for related projects (for example for those in kubernetes-sigs).
We already signed all officially released container images (from Kubernetes v1.24 onwards).

"I've been on show - namely Witcher - where some of the writers were not or actively disliked the books and games (even actively mocking the source material)," DeMayo said in an interview back in October.

The "iconic" Rundown 2.0 Infection is now available, reprising the inaugural Rundown that launched on the PC-only title way back in March 2020.

Not come across Rundowns before? They're a snazzy name for what is essentially a regular game update that also ushers in new time-limited expeditions. Up until now, they'd always replaced the existing one, but now Rundown 2.0 Infection is the first of a "planned rollout that will see every past GTFO Rundown since the game's initial Early Access launch in December 2019 added back to the game".

Topping the November sales chart, that means Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has not only knocked Elden Ring off the coveted top spot, but it's also resisted stiff competition from other games released last month, including God of War: Ragnarök and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. 

According to data from NPD and reported by VGC, that also makes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 the fastest-selling entry not just of the year, but of the franchise's storied history, too, hitting $1bn in sales in just 10 days.

We first reported that the Canadian legal firm was preparing a class-action lawsuit against Epic Games back in 2019. It accused the developer of "knowingly" creating the "very, very addictive game", Fortnite, but had been in limbo ever since as the court assessed whether or not the case could proceed.

Now, however, it seems the court agrees with the plaintiff that the claim "does not appear to be frivolous or manifestly ill-founded" and, according to CTV News, just because there's "no certainty" that Epic created an "addictive" game it "does not preclude the possibility that the game is in fact addictive and that its creator and distributor are presumed to know this".

Polygon reports that the lawsuit - filed in various countries right across the world, including the UK and Germany, due to varying copyright law - maintains free-to-play Hyper Front is "a copy of substantial parts of Valorant", including its "characters, maps, weapons, weapon skins, and charms".

Whilst player data for Hyper Front is currently unknown, Polygon points out that the Google Play Store says it has over a million downloads and almost 50,000 reviews. And whilst Hyper Front is currently unavailable in the US, where Riot is based, it is playable in many other territories where a mobile version of Valorant is currently in development and expected to release.

But there&#8217;s a hack:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some hunters have long believed, however, that the publicly owned parcels on Elk Mountain can be legally reached using a practice called corner-crossing.</p>
<p>Corner-crossing can be visualized in terms of a checkerboard. Ever since the Westward Expansion, much of the Western United States has been divided into alternating squares of public and private land. Corner-crossers, like checker pieces, literally step from one public square to another in diagonal fashion, avoiding trespassing charges. The practice is neither legal nor illegal. Most states discourage it, but none ban it...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's gradual tiptoe back onto Steam is set to continue, with the publisher's enjoyable 2020 action-adventure Immortals Fenyx Rising now confirmed as heading to Valve's platform.


Launched at the tail-end of 2020, Fenyx Rising followed the same pattern as all new Ubisoft PC releases since 2019, skipping Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12% revenue cut compared to Valve's 30%.


However, it appeared Ubisoft's position on its preferred storefronts was about to shift in November after listings for a Steam version of Assassin's Creed Valhalla were discovered, and the move was confirmed by the publisher itself in December, when Valhalla, Anno 1800, and Roller Champions were all announced to be heading to Valve's platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If your eyes are in need of something soothing after blinking your way through the night and this year's Game Awards, then may I introduce you to Europa, an absolutely lovely looking new adventure from developer Helder Pinto.


Sporting a gorgeous Ghibli-esque art style, Europa promises a "peaceful game of adventure, exploration, and meditation" on terraformed moon in Jupiter's shadow. Here, among lakes, meadows, mountains, and the remnants of a fallen civilisation, players - cast as an android called Zee - can run, glide, and fly across the landscape as they try to uncover the story of their creator.


Alongside an "intimate story about growing up and humanity's relationship with nature", Europa promises puzzles, secrets, and hidden dangers, with players able to gradually upgrade their Zephyr jetpack to boost higher and further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, it's the morning after the night before - and what a night. While The Game Awards 2022 dominated the news, Microsoft's $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover faced a major setback with the FTC and Diablo 4's big release date announcement was superseded by serious claims of mismanagement and crunch.  

The awards ceremony was an eventful affair, even without its climactic and rather concerning stage invasion. The typical array of trailers for games like Final Fantasy 16, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor and Street Fighter 6 came thick and fast, alongside big announcements for things such as Death Stranding 2, Hades 2, Horizon Forbidden West PS5-only DLC and Armored Core 6. 
Did Geoff Keighley keep his pledge to make this year's ceremony speedier? Not really. Somewhere, Christopher Judge is now on the second day of his acceptance speech. So, here for you today is a recap of everything we thought was really worth your time - and what we think Death Stranding 2 should actually be titled. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Wesley Yin-Poole.

Wild Hearts, a collaboration between Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series) and EA Originals, transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom's Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan.


This isn't Omega Force's first turn in the monster hunting genre, of course; it previously dabbled in its two Toukiden games, and Wild Hearts expands on those to introduce an experience where up to three players can seamlessly battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.

All pre-purchases get you access to the game and its open beta, plus a handful of extra cosmetics. The two pricier versions add extra cosmetic options and the game's seasonal battle pass, with the Ultimate Edition upgrading that latter reward into its "accelerated" version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8 got its moment in the sun at The Game Awards last night, and for fans of the long-running fighting game franchise like me, one thing stood out: Jun Kazama's return.


Jun Kazama, Jin's mother, made her debut in 1995's Tekken 2 and hasn't been a playable character in the mainline Tekken series since. 27 years later, she's back and it looks like she hasn't aged a day. Tekken time logic, I guess.


The trailer below focuses on the Tekken 8 story (Tekken has an actual real life Guinness World Record for being the longest-running video game storyline!). Once again the Mishimas are at each other's throats, with Tekken 8 picking up where Tekken 7 left off and the war between father and son Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama heating up. When all appears lost, Jin looks up and sees his mother's dramatic return. I doubt there's much interest in a family selfie.

Transformers: Reactivate was shown last night at The Game Awards 2022, with a fresh trailer you can see below. The project is being designed as an online action game for one to four players where you play as some of the franchise's most iconic characters. And yes, you can transform between a vehicle and a bot (obviously!)


The news comes alongside word that Splash Damage has acquired Bulkhead, the UK studio behind World War 2 shooter Battalion 1944, which is also working on Transformers: Reactivate.

Earlier this year, Belarusian-based developer Sad Cat Studio announced it was delaying Replaced's release into 2023 in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 


"The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families. As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced," the studio said in May.

The teaser shows off the new childlike visuals and hints at the story, but until now it wasn't clear what the hidden chapter related to.

Saber Interactive's hotly-anticipated (by me) sequel shows Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus stomp and shoot and generally smash to bits the xenos scum that is the Tyranids (they're the evil aliens, Tom).


The setup here is pretty simple: the Tyranids are devouring worlds (nom nom) and it's up to the Ultramarines to stem the tide. Cue big battles in which one man army Titus teaches the 'nids a lesson in brutality.

I love the music in this clip - a nice reworking of some classic Mario melodies. The clip ends with Mario reaching Princess Peach's Castle. Let's watch:

Set in the fractured fantasy world of Evenor, players take on the role of Wayfinders as they embark on a quest of "endless action and adventure" to restore their home from a foul, consuming force known as the Gloom.


Airship (which made Ruined King: A League of Legends Story and Darksiders Genesis) says each playable Wayfinder comes with its own unique story, play style, and abilities - which can be augmented by using Echoes from fallen foes - with players able to wield arcane magic, mystical tech, and "cunning" weapons as they embark on hunts and expeditions to new locations.

The August 2023 release date means Baldur's Gate 3 arrives, in full, just shy of three years after it first appeared in Steam Early Access, in October 2022. A lot has happened there of course - a lot of tweaking and tuning and honing the experience of the game. Its popularity allowed Larian to breathe and make BG3 a bigger, better thing.
Just for giggles: the August 2023 date also means BG3 arrives 23 years after BG2, and 25 years after the original Baldur's Gate. I imagine you're probably not laughing if you remember those.

Joining Seydoux are actors Norman Reedus (who previously let slip that the game was in development), Troy Baker, Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna. The game will be coming to PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment has unveiled Hellboy Web of Wyrd, a new roguelite action-adventure based on Mike Mignola's comic series that's coming to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


"Welcome to the Butterfly House," teases the official announcement, "a mysterious manor of perverse angles and non-Euclidean geometry built by occultist Pasquale Deneveaux to open a gateway to the Wyrd, a vast, interdimensional web of wondrous and horrifying planes of existence beyond our world. When a B.P.R.D. agent vanishes inside the mansion, it’s up to Hellboy and his team of agents to uncover its forbidden secrets."


Specifics are a little thin right now, but Hellboy Web of Wyrd - which is being developed by West of Dead studio Upstream Arcade - promises an original storyline crafted in collaboration with series creator Mike Mignola, as well as designed to evoke the visuals and atmosphere of the comics. It also stars the always welcome Lance Reddick in the lead role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new investigation into Diablo 4's development has painted a picture of chaos and mismanagement at Activision Blizzard, reportedly resulting in a dash to meet a release date - said to be 6th June next year - that staff believe is "unlikely" to be met without "many hours of overtime or cut features".


In a new report by The Washington Post, assembled after speaking with 15 current and former Blizzard employees, it's claimed Diablo 4's development was troubled from the off, with leadership at the time instilling the project with a "sense of inertia" as large parts of the game were constantly revamped and scrapped - including a planned battle royale mode.


Talking to The Washington Post, team members laid much of the early blame at director Luis Barriga and lead designer Jesse McCree, both of who left the studio in 2021, amid serious allegations of institutionalised discrimination and harassment at Activision Blizzard. Colleagues claim, for instance, McCree "would grow intrigued by different aspects of the game and then lose interest and hand it off to other people without finishing what he started."
