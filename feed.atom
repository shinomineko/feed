        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Candle Games, the developer behind critically acclaimed horror outings Detention and Devotion, has shared a first trailer - and launched a crowdfunding campaign - for its previously revealed "Taopunk" action-platformer Nine Sols, which it's aiming to release in Q3 next year.
When first we heard of Nine Sols last year, Red Candle described it as a "lore rich hand-drawn 2D platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat" - and an accompany bit of concept art set the dark, manga-inspired tone of the experience with its combination of cute animal protagonist and piles of mangled, bloody limbs.

It's a move that has caused considerable consternation amongst the Gran Turismo community, and understandably so given the ability to buy in-game currency on the PlayStation Store, with the game's miserly in-game economy seemingly pushing players towards microtransactions. It's feedback that hasn't gone unnoticed, with the update accompanied by a note from series creator Kazunori Yamauchi.

It's also completely separate from its consoles and PC counterparts (meaning no cross-play with those versions), featuring unique battle passes, even mobile-only maps and gameplay modes.

Not to be confused with last year's four-episode CGI effort Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, or indeed the non-Netflix-related live-action movie reboot Welcome to Raccoon City, the series known only as Resident Evil splits its narrative across two timelines, straddling either side of a global apocalypse caused by a deadly virus.

Coming from the same team that brought us the Wendigo filled nightmare of Until Dawn, The Quarry will once more focus on a group of teens. But rather than a snowy cabin escape, this time the game will focus on nine counsellors on their last day of summer camp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven't been keeping abreast of Dragon Age creator David Gaider's activities following his departure from BioWare, you might perhaps be surprised to learn he's been working on a roleplaying musical for the last few years, and now the project has just received its first teaser trailer - alongside a name change to Stray Gods.
Stray Gods is the work of Australian developer Summerfall Studios - where Gaider now serves as creative director, having co-founded the company in 2019 - and was previously known as Chorus: An Adventure Musical in its Kickstarter days. Described as "one part narrative-driven adventure and one part interactive musical", Stray Gods follows the story of Grace, a young woman whose life is upended after the Last Muse of ancient Greek mythology dies in her arms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine, the acclaimed heist caper from developer Pocketwatch Games, is getting a long-awaited sequel on PC.
The original Monaco debuted almost a decade ago, back in 2013, challenging players - either alone or with three co-op friends in tow - to orchestrate the perfect heist. As in the movies, that required assembling a crew of uniquely able criminals (from locksmiths and tunnellers to a pickpocket with a monkey in this case) before attempting to navigate each labyrinthine map's security and patrols in order to claim the prize. Chaos usually ensues.

Well, you're in luck, courtesy of Humble Games, which has just given its slate of upcoming titles an airing in a series of its own reveals. And if you missed it, you can catch up with everything the publisher shared by perusing the words below.
Things got off to an exciting start with in the form of Monaco 2, the sequel to Pocketwatch Games' acclaimed heist caper. Unsurprisingly, chaotic heists remain the focus in this follow-up, but there's a new emphasis on verticality in the procedurally generated stages - made possible thanks to a visual style shift to fully, isometric 3D. It'll also be playable solo and co-operatively, although probably not for some time, given it's still "early" in development.

Why exactly was this car there? After all, the Chevy Tahoe in question is a GMT800, a model from the early noughties. Given that that is roughly 500 years before Master Chief's time, it is unlikely that any of these cars would actually still be around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's just updated its Mega Drive offering as part of its Switch Online service, adding three new games - including two classics from beloved studio Treasure. 
Alien Soldier and Light Crusader lead the way, the former a boss-rush side-scroller that plays out as if Jeff Minter had a hand in a Gunstar Heroes remix, the latter an action adventure that sits apart from the rest of Treasure's back catalogue with its darker fantasy tone. Also I've not played it anyway near as much as the rest of Treasure's games and can't wait to get properly acquainted with it now it's on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Elden Ring patch, available today, brings significant changes to the game.
Among a number of new additions, the most interesting is the addition of NPC markers to the map. Where some players have lost the thread of in-game quests (even making an app for it), now it will be a lot easier to keep track of characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those with an excess of free time and patient resolve might very well have delighted at Microsoft's latest, typically languid Xbox indie showcase, but for everyone with somewhat busier diaries, please enjoy this convenient summary of everything shown, bringing the likes of co-op escape room shenanigans, movie-themed mystery, and rogue-like golfing in purgatory.
Lost Eidolons, which kicked off today's livestream, is a tactical RPG from developer Ocean Drive Studio that casts players as Eden, a mercenary captain, sending them on an adventure across an empire riven by civil war. Expect turn-based battling and a "gripping cinematic narrative" when this one comes to PC and Xbox Series X/S in Q3 this year.

Barlow actually outlined Immortality's basic concept last June, revealing it would tell the story of Marissa Marcel, an actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.

Originally known as Secret Legend before getting a name change to Tunic at E3 2017, the Zelda-inspired isometric adventure was initially expected to arrive in 2018.

Sunbreak will, we're told, pick up immediately following the resolution of the base game's Rampage storyline, with the expansion's new story arc kicking into gear when previously revealed new monster Lunagaron - plus Dame Fioyrane, a royal knight from a distant kingdom - are sighted in Rise's familiar Shrine Ruins area. Capcom reminds players that Sunbreak can be accessed after completing the 7-star hub quest Serpent Goddess of Thunder in the base game and that a selection of powerful support items are now available to players via a recent free update should they want to accelerate their progress in preparation for the expansion.

GTA Online profiles can be migrated via a Rockstar Games Social Club account upon loading the Xbox Series X/S or PS5 game, as detailed on Rockstar's support page. This one-time process will enable players to migrate their characters, GTA$, progression, stats, vehicles, properties, weapons, clothing, and player-created jobs, but Rockstar notes the account will no longer be available on last-gen consoles after migration is complete.

This latest pinball table - Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure - is a complete recreation of the iconic 1993 table created by Williams. It is available for Pinball FX users, be it be played through console, PC or mobile. However, this DLC offers players just one table, and yet it will set fans back £12.49 (or $14.99). Needless to say, this price tag has left many to raise an eyebrow or two.

Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood will be the first version of the attraction to open in the west (a second US park is planned for Universal Orlando Resort's Epic Universe expansion, reportedly opening in 2025), and will loosely follow the exuberant, Mario-themed design of the existing Japanese park.

The news comes via Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller in a newly released developer video, and his spin, it has to be said, is a little weird, framing the beta phases Blizzard has planned for the rest of the year as some sort of generous bounty for those existing Overwatch players who've been starved of content since the developer opted to focus its attention entirely on Overwatch 2.

Ascension, as the free update is officially known, got its unveiling as part of tonight's PlayStation State of Play livestream, but significantly more information has now arrived in a new PlayStation Blog post. The headline, though, is that the update - significant enough to warrant boosting its version number up to 3.0 - will bring campaign co-op and a new survival mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of Aperture Desk Job - Valve's free playable "short" set in the set in the Portal universe - a spot of eager datamining has uncovered references to four unannounced Valve games, including a Half-Life: Alyx follow-up, a Source 2 port of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a recreation of a cancelled Portal title, and Citadel, a Half-Life shooter/RTS hybrid.
All this was uncovered by long-time Valve watcher Tyler McVicker, with at least some of the new discoveries pointing to titles long rumoured to be in development at Valve, but never actually confirmed. The caveat, of course, is that their mere existence as references in Aperture Desk Job's code doesn't mean these are actual games still in development (particularly given Valve's well-reported experiment-then-ditch approach to game design), or that they'll ever see that light of day. As McVicker says in a video documenting his discoveries, "take everything that we're about to discuss with a grain of salt".

<blockquote><p>Zelle’s immediacy has also made it a favorite of fraudsters. Other types of bank transfers or transactions involving payment cards typically take at least a day to clear. But once crooks scare or trick victims into handing over money via Zelle, they can siphon away thousands of dollars in seconds. There’s no way for customers &#8212; and in many cases, the banks themselves &#8212; to retrieve the money.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It’s not clear who is legally liable for such losses. Banks say that returning money to defrauded customers is not their responsibility, since the federal law covering electronic transfers &#8212; known in the industry as Regulation E ­&#8211; requires them to cover only &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; transactions, and the fairly common scam that Mr. Faunce fell prey to tricks people into making the transfers themselves. Victims say because they were duped into sending the money, the transaction is unauthorized. Regulatory guidance has so far been murky...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first numbered Gran Turismo game in over eight years has brought with many beloved features that have been missing for a while, with the headline being the return of proper car customization. Being able to spec out a humble Toyota Aqua until it's race ready is a fun experience, but there's one problem - it's kind of ruining the multiplayer experience at the moment. 
Gran Turismo 7's online offering is near identical to that seen in the multiplayer-focussed Gran Turismo Sport - hence the multiplayer mode being called simply Sport - in that there are daily races that rotate in and out with various requirements. Previously, these races were typically subject to a Balance of Performance, or BoP - a term borrowed from real-life GT racing that operates along similar lines, with the game ensuring all cars entered have a similar performance to ensure close racing.

(No, it's not free if you bought it on PS4 or Xbox One already.)
Exactly how much you'll be paying depends very much on where you plan to play it, however. For Xbox Series X/S owners, GTA Online is currently listed at £8.99 on the Microsoft Store. That'll go back up to its non-discounted price of £17.99 in three months time, on 14th June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a rather low-key end of 2021 - in which Sea of Thieves players got buriable treasure, some fancy fireworks, and the ability to sit on things - Rare is ready to step things up again for the piratical multiplayer adventure's first big update of 2022, bringing Spanish-style sea fort raids and more when Season 6 arrives this Thursday, 10th March.
We do, of course, already know much of what Season 6 has to offer thanks to Rare's early 2022 blow-out, in which it detailed its ambitious plans for the year. If you missed that, though, the first big addition comes in the form of six Spanish-style sea forts dotted around the map. These imposing edifices, sucked into the Sea of Thieves as part of the game's new ongoing storyline, essentially function as solo-friendly, on-demand World Events, serving up a swifter, more streamlined experience compared to the likes of Skeleton Forts.

Update 3.3 was initially due to launch in February, but DICE made the decision to delay its release to "improve the quality of our updates, and include additional changes". Its key new feature, however, remains the aforementioned Scoreboard UI refresh, which DICE has detailed more thoroughly in its latest patch notes, confirming an "improved" Match Overview, a new team vs. team split look for Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush, and Team Deathmatch modes.

<blockquote><p>The attack works by using the device&#8217;s speaker to issue voice commands. As long as the speech contains the device wake word (usually &#8220;Alexa&#8221; or &#8220;Echo&#8221;) followed by a permissible command, the Echo will carry it out, researchers from Royal Holloway University in London and Italy&#8217;s University of Catania found. Even when devices require verbal confirmation before executing sensitive commands, it&#8217;s trivial to bypass the measure by adding the word &#8220;yes&#8221; about six seconds after issuing the command. Attackers can also exploit what the researchers call the &#8220;FVV,&#8221; or full voice vulnerability, which allows Echos to make self-issued commands without temporarily reducing the device volume...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

That's all set to change, however, with an expanded version of Paradise Killer finally heading to Xbox and PlayStation on 16th March.
In its original guise, Paradise Killer was wonderfully idiosyncratic, a breathlessly stylish blend of visual novel and exploratory open-world murder mystery unfolding on the gaudy, sun-drenched Paradise 24 - part tropical island retreat, part shrine to a pantheon of preposterous cosmic gods - where players, in the role of Lady Love Die, must hunt for clues and cross-examine suspects to discover exactly who horrifically butchered the island's ruling council.

Spotted by Nintendo Everything, a new box for the Nintendo Switch OLED now features a bright pink puffed up Kirby. Kirby is clearly so puffed up as he has just swallowed the box, contents and all.

<p>From the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this work, we expose the cryptographic design and implementation of Android&#8217;s Hardware-Backed Keystore in Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S8, S9, S10, S20, and S21 flagship devices. We reversed-engineered and provide a detailed description of the cryptographic design and code structure, and we unveil severe design flaws. We present an IV reuse attack on AES-GCM that allows an attacker to extract hardware-protected key material, and a downgrade attack that makes even the latest Samsung devices vulnerable to the IV reuse attack. We demonstrate working key extraction attacks on the latest devices. We also show the implications of our attacks on two higher-level cryptographic protocols between the TrustZone and a remote server: we demonstrate a working FIDO2 WebAuthn login bypass and a compromise of Google&#8217;s Secure Key Import...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After some eight years since the last numbered instalment, Polyphony Digital's flagship PlayStation series returns today with Gran Turismo 7 - and going live alongside it on the PlayStation Store are some microtransactions which represent a slightly tweaked approach to the one we saw in Gran Turismo Sport. 
The microtransactions in Gran Turismo Sport - released in a post-launch update - had players buying individual cars at a set price, with only those of a value up to 2 million in-game credits available for purchase. Gran Turismo 7, however, does away with that restriction and simply offers in-game currency for sale, starting at £1.99 for 100,000 credits all the way to £15.99 for 2,000,000 credits.

The original Little Big Adventure - an evocative blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that charted the story of young hero Twinsen, on the run from evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994 and was followed by a sequel three years later. With both titles now over a quarter of a century old, they are, understandably, rather lacking in terms of modern day polish, and 2.21 is looking to remedy that as it seeks to bring the games to more players ahead of its planned third instalment in the Little Big Adventure series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Colossal Order's acclaimed city builder Cities: Skylines will be free on the Epic Games Store starting next Thursday, 10th March.
Cities: Skylines is hardly a spring chicken at this point, of course, having originally laid its urban foundations on PC back in 2015, but it still delivers an enormously enjoyable spin on the classic city-building formula, alongside ample tools catering to a range of different players - from aesthetics-obsessed urban planners to those more interested in logistical optimisation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's troubled The Settlers reboot will no longer launch on 17th March as previously announced, with the publisher having made the decision to postpone its release - for the third time since its announcement in 2018 - following closed beta feedback from the community.
When Ubisoft first revealed it would be revisiting the Settlers' much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula in a new series instalment, it told fans to expect the title in autumn the following year. As that window approached, however, it announced it was pushing the game into 2020 - but that delay was extended indefinitely as summer 2020 rolled around.

In fact, it was so bumper that European players of the new MMO ARPG experienced long queue times before eventually getting into the game. This led Amazon to create an entirely new regional server in a bid to ease congestion.
But even with this new 'Europe West' server, queue times for Lost Ark are still huge. Speaking to IGN, Amazon Games franchise leader Soomin Park said Lost Ark's Europe Central region "continues to be filled to the brim" which as a result has led to "player queues and some instability in the region".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intellivision has cut its latest fundraising campaign for the still-unreleased Amico console short, setting yet more alarm bells ringing over the troubled machine's future.
The Amico, designed as a low-spec console with a family focus, was announced in 2018 and initially expected to arrive in October 2020. However, the machine has since been thrice-delayed, with still no sign of a launch in sight. Worse still, a recent SEC filing highlighted "significant debt" for Intellivision and suggested that, having made no revenue since its inception, the company may not be able to operate beyond July 2022 without additional funds - despite 6,000 pre-orders for Amico still being unfulfilled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RimWorld, developer Ludeon Studios' widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim, has been refused classification in Australia, preventing its release and effectively banning it from sale. 
It's a decision that, on the one hand, isn't particularly surprising given the Australian Classification Board notorious sensitivity around certain issues in games - RimWorld is, after all, a simulation whose incredibly deep systems make drug-fuelled cannibalism an entirely legitimate pastime for colonists - but it's also a little peculiar, insofar as RimWorld has been available to purchase on PC in Australia for nearly five years.

For those that didn't make the head of the queue when reservations opened last July, however - and who are currently eyeing up a rather non-specific ETA for their unit - Valve has a bit of promising news, saying production of its new portable gaming PC will be "in the hundreds of thousands" by next month.
That's according to Valve designer Lawrence Yang who, in conversation with IGN, explained the company expects production to "ramp very quickly" as it continues "surmounting" the initial supply chain issues that led to Steam Deck's delay last year. "Very quickly we'll be in the tens of thousands [of units produced]," Yang revealed. "By the second month we'll be in the hundreds of thousands, and beyond that it'll grow even quicker".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nice piece of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08477">research</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Among the many types of malicious codes, ransomware poses a major threat. Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker&#8217;s RSA private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware. It is expected that our method can be used to reduce the damage caused by Hive ransomware...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Valve does, however, have some hitherto unseen Portal on the way for your tearily grateful playing pleasure in the form of a free interactive tutorial thingy for Steam Deck - titled Aperture Desk Job and launching next week.
Admittedly, "interactive tutorial" sounds neither riveting nor sexy, which is probably why Valve is referring to its new Steam Deck experience as a "free playable short". But what actually is it?, you may be wondering. Well, in much the same way as Valve returned to the Portal universe for its entirely endearing Steam VR performance test a few years back, Aperture Desk Job is designed to walk Steam Deck owners through their new handheld's controls and features, "while not being nearly as boring as that sounds."

Back in October, Valve made a stand by banning all blockchain games from its Steam platform, updating its policy documents to reflect the change. The move was well-received by the wider community, though the developer of Age of Rust - one of the games impacted by the new policy - went into a bit more detail, claiming that Steam didn't want to allow items of real-world value on its store.

"Save Appalachia from an otherworldly, all-encompassing invasion," is how Bethesda explains this one on its roadmap, "including Public Event takeovers, new random encounters, a new seasonal Public Event, and more!".

And if you're as giddy about the whole thing as I am, you might like to know exactly when you'll be able to start playing based on your time zone and platform of choice - which is information Bandai Namco has now made available in the form of an infographic.
Elden Ring officially releases this Friday, 25th February, in Europe, but, depending on your location and platform, you might just get to play it a little earlier. Here in the UK, for instance, PC players will be able to start their Elden Ring journey at 11pm on Thursday, 24th February - those that pre-order can pre-loaded the game 48hrs ahead of release for an on-the-dot start (not that I'd ever usually condone pre-ordering but, you know, Elden Ring).
