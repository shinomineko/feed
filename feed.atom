        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alice: Madness Returns has once again disappeared from Steam.

Alice's disappearance will be particularly frustrating for some, as the 2011 game only returned to Steam in February 2022 after a DRM issue saw it removed from sale for almost five years. Now, just a few months later, it's gone again.

The reason for its sudden and unexpected disappearance? It's not entirely clear. Steam's not giving away much; Alice: Madness Returns' Steam page simply says "at the request of the publisher, Alice: Madness Returns is no longer available for sale on Steam", which is a blanket statement that covers pretty much anything and everything.

Yesterday, developer Void Interactive tweeted that it was dealing with a "suggested trademark infringement" of its "recent Night Club map" which rolled out as part of the early access game's most recent update earlier in the week.

"We take IP concerns very seriously, and in a show of good faith, we have decided to remove the subject materials and any reference to them from Ready or Not and from any of our social media or other publications," Void said (thanks, NME).

After searching through piles of Lego bricks, the pair eventually revealed a Red Yoshi, Purple Toad, Blue Shy Guy, Waddlewing and more. We also spotted Nabbit, Hammer Bro, Toady, and Baby Yoshi, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew that Lego Brawls - a minifigure fighting game previously launched on Apple Arcade - was set to relaunch this summer on consoles and now we have a release date: 2nd September, 2022.

Published by Bandai Namco, the fighter will arrive on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S where the Smash Bros-like brawl will let "Minifigure mayhem begin". Here's a new teaser to celebrate:

As Tom explained at the time the ports were announced, the idea here is to battle - solo or with up to eight network players - and collect minifigures which you can then customise to create your own hero of choice. You can then take said hero and attempt to tackle the game's global leaderboards.

As spotted by PCGN, a number of new items introduced along with the Werewolf expansion have descriptions that players of Square Enix's hugely-popular MMORPG may find familiar. 

There's the Racked Teak-a Greatshelves - a fantastic, if not particularly subtle, nod to Shadowbringers' Rak'tika Greatwood where the Viera live - as well as a reference to the game's theme track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite its controversial launch, Diablo Immortal - Blizzard's pocket-sized Diablo experience - has generated almost £20 million ($24m) since it launched earlier this month.

According to the analysts at Appmagic (thanks, Pocket Gamer), that makes Diablo Immortal - which has been downloaded over eight million times in just a fortnight - one of Blizzard's biggest mobile app, second only to the immense popularity of Hearthstone. 

The game has seen its biggest success in the US, which accounts for 26 per cent of all downloads. This is followed by South Korea, Brazil, and Japan, with 11 per cent, 8 per cent, and 8 per cent of the market share respectively. The UK only features in the 17 per cent "other" category which aggregates low-level figures across the rest of the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, developer Supermassive released its sumputous slasher horror The Quarry on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in collaboration with publisher 2K Games - but a new report has claimed the game was originally in development as a "signature" title for Stadia, before Google made the decision to downsize its gaming operation and send the project elsewhere.


Stadia, of course, launched to much fanfare in 2019, and part of Google's promise to early adopters was that the service would bring its own console-like exclusives from both first- and third-parties. To that end, Google established its own internal game development studio and signed deals with external developers, including Supermassive, as announced in 2020.


Those plans, however, changed dramatically just 14 months after Stadia's high-profile arrival, with Google announcing a major rethink of its cloud streaming strategy following a less-than-stellar launch, which included the cancellation of all internal game development as it began prioritising selling its tech to third-parties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its ongoing war against cheaters, the team behind Call of Duty's server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, known as Ricochet, has unveiled a new mitigation technique that takes a player's weapons (and fists) away when the system identifies them as a cheater.


Word of this latest mitigation technique comes via a new blog update detailing the current state of Call of Duty's anti-cheat solution, and follows previously revealed anti-cheat techniques Cloaking and Damage Shield.


Damage Shield, Richochet's first major mitigation technique, essentially works by turning on God Mode for all legitimate players when a cheater is detected in-match. Cloaking, meanwhile, makes it impossible for detected cheaters to see opponents and bullets, or even hear sounds.

"Typically, the demos you see in our Demo channel are created after the game is completed (or nearly completed) and represents an almost final to final version. Think of these as akin to 'show floor demos' and not necessarily indicative of the final product."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard has confirmed Overwatch 2, which will be an "always on, always evolving" free-to-play game when it launches into early access on 4th October, will be ditching its predecessor's lootboxes in favour of a seasonal battle pass and in-game store.


That news was shared during an extended Overwatch 2 livestream this evening, primarily focused on the game's live-service model and seasonal content plan - the latter of which, according to Overwatch 2's game director Aaron Keller, will enable Blizzard to deliver new content to players on a more "frequent and consistent" basis compared to the original game.


Each season will last nine weeks and alternately add a new hero then a new map. That's a little different for season 1, however, with Blizzard promising three new heroes, six new maps, the new Push game mode, weekly challenges, 30+ new skins, and a new mythic skin when things get underway on 4th October in tandem with Overwatch 2's early access launch.

In response to multiple lawsuits against the company, Activision Blizzard conducted its own investigation and has published the findings.


"Contrary to many of the allegations, the Board and its external advisors have determined that there is no evidence to suggest that Activision Blizzard senior executives ever intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported," reads the report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we're ready to round off this two-week not-E3 announcement bonanza with a chat about Starfield, and a look to the future.

Starfield dominated Microsoft and Bethesda's E3 event and was arguably the biggest game on show over the fortnight, though praise was hardly unanimous. It looked like a Bethesda RPG, many said, somehow not expecting exactly just that. Between the news you can't fly to space and won't have a voice, was it really as disappointing as some have made out?


Finally, with this main glut of not-E3 conferences done and dusted, talk turns to next year - when 2023 will see the return of both E3 and Summer Game Fest as in-person events. What will that look like, and will things be less messy in twelve months? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

The map, titled "Fortune’s Keep", features several key locations including Keep, a towering structure which houses 20 cannons, 10 staircases, 12 rooms and a fountain, and Smuggler's Cove, another area with a focus on verticality, which includes eight ladders, three ziplines, eight huts and 11 boats.

Given the approximate size of Fortune's Keep, one could speculate that this new map could replace Rebirth Island, the secondary map first introduced to Warzone with the release of Black Ops: Cold War.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The high energy costs of neural network training and inference led to the use of acceleration hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. While such devices enable us to train large-scale neural networks in datacenters and deploy them on edge devices, their designers&#8217; focus so far is on average-case performance. In this work, we introduce a novel threat vector against neural networks whose energy consumption or decision latency are critical. We show how adversaries can exploit carefully-crafted sponge examples, which are inputs designed to maximise energy consumption and latency, to drive machine learning (ML) systems towards their worst-case performance. Sponge examples are, to our knowledge, the first denial-of-service attack against the ML components of such systems. We mount two variants of our sponge attack on a wide range of state-of-the-art neural network models, and find that language models are surprisingly vulnerable. Sponge examples frequently increase both latency and energy consumption of these models by a factor of 30×. Extensive experiments show that our new attack is effective across different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU and an ASIC simulator) on a wide range of different language tasks. On vision tasks, we show that sponge examples can be produced and a latency degradation observed, but the effect is less pronounced. To demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge examples in the real world, we mount an attack against Microsoft Azure&#8217;s translator and show an increase of response time from 1ms to 6s (6000×). We conclude by proposing a defense strategy: shifting the analysis of energy consumption in hardware from an average-case to a worst-case perspective...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

"On 31st May, a lawyer representing Nintendo called me and asked me to take down nine videos off the channel," SynaMax explained in a new video (spotted by VGC). "I'm really disappointed in Nintendo that they would force me to take down these videos because they want compulsory licenses."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are looking to get your hands on Arkane's upcoming vampire riddled RPG to play with your nearest and dearest, here is a quick heads up: you will only be able to save any progress you make in Redfall's campaign if you are the host.
Speaking to IGN, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith revealed, "whoever hosts the session, or whoever initiates the session... their progress is persistent for them. But [for] other people, it's not. In terms of what missions you've unlocked and such, the host, their progression matters."
He went on to explain, "if you sign on with a friend and they're halfway through the game, and you play the second half of the game with them and then you need to go back and you want to play on your own, you'll be starting at the beginning of the campaign with a character".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has reactivated the previous versions of Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 on PC, following player feedback.


After the Capcom showcase, the publisher released a free upgrade across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, adding in ray-tracing, 4K support, and 3D audio.


However, on PC the new version had increased minimum system requirements and was unable to revert back to the previous version, locking some players out of the game. This has now been reactivated.

FIFA 22, if you haven't been keeping track, brought some solid improvements to the long-running football series when it launched last year, but its wins were, once again, overshadowed by what Eurogamer's Wesley Yin-Poole called its "morally bankrupt monetisation" in his review.


"I play a lot of FIFA, and with good reason," Wes wrote. "I enjoy it, in a grumpy sort of way. Reporting on all the good, bad and ugly FIFA has to offer has been a fascinating part of my job over the last decade. If you're only in it for Career Mode, for example, FIFA 22 is a good shout. If you only play Volta (there must be someone!) then there's nothing particularly offensive about the game. But context is king. Ultimate Team cannot be ignored."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has claimed Sony is working on a "pro" controller for PlayStation 5 that it's planning to officially unveil "soon".


That's according to the ever leaky Tom Henderson who, writing for Try Hard Guides (thanks VGC), claims to have seen images of a prototype from a source wishing to remain anonymous.


Henderson says the new controller retains the same basic style of the existing PlayStation 5 controller but features a number of key differences. These include "removable stick units" - which can be switched in and out using buttons below the analog sticks - plus trigger stops, a seemingly removal grip, and rear buttons that Henderson describes as "flappy paddles", presumably similar to those seen on the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its long-awaited official unveiling last week, Naughty Dog has given another glimpse of its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for PS5 and PC, this time showcasing what it calls a "glow up" for supporting character Tess.


During last week's Summer Game Fest reveal, one of key arguments Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann made for remaking the original Last of Us - a game that already got the remaster treatment in 2014 - was that the additional power of modern hardware would enable it to get closer to its "original vision". The studio specifically highlighted the remake's rebuilt character models and faces, which it said would better reflect the cast's original performances.


Inevitably, the remake's character changes have come as something of a shock to fans who've grown attached to the original versions over the last nine years, with both Joel and Ellie now sporting more realistic facial makeovers that age them notably. That's especially true for Naughty Dog's latest reveal, showcasing the new version of Joel's friend Tess, who initially agrees to help smuggle Ellie out of the city.

Yamagiwa previously worked at Sony's Japan Studio when it published Bloodborne, so understands the importance of balanced difficulty.


"Difficult games shouldn't be difficult just for the sake of it," Yamagiwa told IGN. "I think it's really important that this difficulty exists for the purpose of delivering a sense of accomplishment to the players once they have overcome it. That's why I think players should always be able to blame themselves when they die. The game has to be fair and its difficulty should never be unreasonable. In that regard, it works in my favour that I'm not very good at games myself. I'll always naturally be judging the fairness of games."

But one streamer, Kwitty23, decided to beat the whole game playing as Malenia. Not only that, he only used one move the entire run: her iconic Waterfowl Dance.


Funniest of all was when Kwitty23 ended up fighting Malenia as Malenia and proceeded to destroy her first time. Turns out she's pretty weak to her own attacks.

The following artwork is the only one in Canda's collection to depict a landscape that has not (to date) appeared in Fortnite. Are we looking into the future of the game? Or, perhaps more likely, is this an area Epic Games ended up not using?

This adaptation, which is set to release on 11th August 2023, will focus on the story of one teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills won them a series of Nissan competitions to become a professional race car driver. Deadline reports the screenplay has been written by Jason Hall.
If this all sounds familiar to you and you are getting a strong sense of déjà vu, well, you're right to feel that way. After all, this is the same concept from the Gran Turismo film that never was.

At the time of this announcement, Capcom revealed those yet to experience the games will be able to purchase the newly updated Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions from their respective stores, but existing owners on Xbox One and PS4 would be able to grab the updates relevant to their platform at no additional cost.
However, it now transpires this is not the case for those who got their hands on Resident Evil 7 through the PlayStation Plus Collection (something that is exclusive to the PS5).
Instead, those who have been playing the game via the PS Plus Collection but also want to experience the game with its 4K resolution, "high" framerates, ray tracing, and 3D audio will need to purchase the game separately (via IGN).

<blockquote><p>Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, however, have created a novel hardware attack, which combines memory corruption and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/new-flaw-in-intel-chips-lets-attackers-slip-their-own-data-into-secure-enclave/">speculative execution</a> attacks to sidestep the security feature. The attack shows that pointer authentication can be defeated without leaving a trace, and as it utilizes a hardware mechanism, no software patch can fix it.</p>
<p>The attack, appropriately called &#8220;Pacman,&#8221; works by &#8220;guessing&#8221; a pointer authentication code (PAC), a cryptographic signature that confirms that an app hasn’t been maliciously altered. This is done using speculative execution&#8212;a technique used by modern computer processors to speed up performance by speculatively guessing various lines of computation&#8212;to leak PAC verification results, while a hardware side-channel reveals whether or not the guess was correct...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

It will also touch base with the many fans who played the game 25 years ago and discuss the resulting impact it had on them.

At the time, the developer said this delay was to ensure it delivers "the best possible experience" to players on its eventual launch. However, it has now been revealed that, as with other games, this delay was also due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
"We had a bit of a weird thing with the multiplayer because... part of our team is based out in the Ukraine... So, we had to delay the multiplayer because they had to move," The Quarry creative director Will Byles told IGN.
"We had to move the server from Kyiv up into Warsaw and those guys had to get out [of] there because it was obviously really dangerous."

Switch has faced widespread complaints around Joy-Con controller drift since its launch in 2017, leading to class action lawsuits, and even EU calls for an investigation into the issue after it received more than 25,000 complaints from numerous countries. Reports were significant enough that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologised for the issue in 2020, which it's since claimed to have "improved".


More recently, a Kotaku report claimed Nintendo of America recieved "thousands" of faulty Joy-Cons each week at height of drift issues, and now UK consumer watchdog Which? has shared its own findings into the severity of the problem, claiming two in five (40 percent) of Joy-Con controllers from the original Switch are affected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When last we heard of Fallout 5, it was little more than a "one-pager" idea at Bethesda that may or may not come to fruition; however, studio director Todd Howard has now confirmed a new mainline entry in the beloved Fallout series is definitely happening, but won't release until after The Elder Scrolls 6.


In conversation with IGN, Howard revealed The Elder Scrolls 6 is currently in pre-production (confirming previous rumours around the project's progress), before adding, "And, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate's pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well."


In other words, with Bethesda's next big title, sci-fi RPG Starfield, delayed until next year, and still no word on a potential release window for The Elder Scrolls 6 - despite the game having received its first official tease back in 2018 - it sounds like there'll be an extremely long wait until Fallout 5 finally sees the light of day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard - which continues its attempts to reassert itself following many months of shocking allegations it fostered a company culture where sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive - has confirmed Overwatch 2's second closed beta will launch for PC and consoles on 28th June.


Blizzard first announced its intention to "decouple" Overwatch 2's PvP and PvE modes and begin a series of multiplayer-focused betas back in March, and the first of these took place in April. That initial run gave participants a first look at Overwatch 2's 5v5 gameplay, Push mode, four new maps, new hero Sojourn, and reworkings of Orisa, Doomfist, Bastion, and Sombra.


Round two, announced earlier today on Twitter, will shake things up a little further, giving players access to new tank hero Junker Queen and a new map. Blizzard is saving further details for a livestream airing this Thursday, 16th June, at 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PT, and says it'll be discussing the game's live-service model and seasonal content plan at the same time.

Asobo first targeted the US for a bit of a visual makeover in its second-ever World Update back in November 2020, introducing a significant number of improvements to the United States' multitudinous geological and man-made landmarks.
At the time, it said that the sheer size of the US meant it would eventually be revisiting the area, and now, seven World Updates later, that day has come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Microsoft shared a list of 50 new titles heading to Game Pass over the next 12 months, and it's now given a little more detail on one of those games - developer Iron Gate Studio's acclaimed viking survival hit Valheim - confirming it'll be launching for PC Game Pass this autumn with an Xbox release next spring.


Valheim, if you're unfamiliar, launched into Steam early access last February, and its refined viking survival action - which sees players exploring a gorgeous open-world, slowly preparing themselves to battle powerful creatures and prove themselves worthy of entering Valhalla - immediately drew critical acclaim.


It was also a massive sales hit too, managing to sell a staggering 4m copies in only three weeks. One year on, it's shifted over 10 million copies on PC, and development continues apace, with work on its highly anticipated Mistlands update said to be "well underway".

Fans can look forward to seeing "the last episode of the story of Eivor" via a final free chapter - which will presumably tell the story of how our Norse heroine came to rest in Vinland. 


Before then, there's a new Niflheim-set roguelite game mode named The Forgotten Saga coming this summer, and a final set of challenge vaults coming this autumn to conclude the game's Tombs of the Fallen mystery. And, of course, there's the game's seasonal festivals. All of this content comes for free.

Bowser remains the only member of Louarn's company Team Xecuter to be arrested, deported and now imprisoned in the US, for his part in the group's sale of console mod devices that allowed people to play pirated games. Louarn, a French citizen, meanwhile lives in Avignon and was recently interviewed by Le Monde (paywall), via TorrentFreak.


"I was't going to end up as an engineer earning €5k a month when I realized, at 18, that hacking was not just fun, but that there was a way to make a lot of money," Louarn says, of how he got into the hacking game. "Stealing from companies that make billions, what do I care?"

<blockquote><p>Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, quickly noticed something odd about the new feature: Not only did it allow the car to automatically start within 130 seconds of being unlocked with the NFC card, but it also put the car in a state to accept entirely new keys­with no authentication required and zero indication given by the in-car display.</p>
<p>&#8220;The authorization given in the 130-second interval is too general&#8230; [it&#8217;s] not only for drive,&#8221; Herfurt said in an online interview. &#8220;This timer has been introduced by Tesla… in order to make the use of the NFC card as a primary means of using the car more convenient. What should happen is that the car can be started and driven without the user having to use the key card a second time. The problem: within the 130-second period, not only the driving of the car is authorized, but also the [enrolling] of a new key.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has played down reports that long-running Street Fighter character Fei Long can no longer appear in the famous fighting game franchise due to a clash with the Bruce Lee estate.


Fei Long, originally created for 1993's Super Street Fighter 2 as one of four new challengers, is heavily-inspired by real-life movie martial arts legend Bruce Lee.


Last month, Street Fighter 5 composer Daniel Lindholm suggested Fei Long may no longer feature in the series because the Lee Bruce estate insists depictions of the Enter the Dragon star must be "honourable", rather than humourous in the wake of the "comedy" cameo in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

Still, even this brief snippet was intriguing. 


"The experience of being attacked by hordes of crazed ganado is truly an iconic moment from Resident Evil," director Yasuhiro Anpo said, as we saw Leon sneaking around what looks like an early section from the game.

It'll also let players try out Sunbreak's new Switch Skill Swap system, new Silkbind attacks, and a variety of handy tutorials.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has slapped a new release window on Fallout 76's previously announced The Pitt expansion, confirming the Fallout-3-inspired update will arrive some time this September.


Fallout 76's The Pitt expansion was annouced for a 2022 release last June, and its arrival date was narrowed down a little further, specifically to this "autumn", as part of February's 2022 roadmap. Last night's Xbox showcase, though, saw it inching even closer to receiving a proper release date, with its new gameplay trailer heralding a September launch.


The Pitt - inspired by the second add-on released for 2008's much-loved Fallout 3 - will arrive as part of Fallout 76's Season 10 update in September, and marks the first time players will be able to travel beyond the boundaries of Appalachia in the online game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yesterday's big Starfield gameplay reveal, Bethesda has re-emerged with a few additional details regarding its highly anticipated sci-fi RPG, confirming that dialogue scenes will be presented in first-person throughout, and that the main character won't be voiced.


If you're only familiar with Bethesda games prior to Fallout 4, that probably won't seem like all that big a deal, given that mute protagonists and lengthy first-person conversations with dead-eyed NPCs were par for the course in Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, and Oblivion.


It's really only notable when you factor in Fallout 4; here, Bethesda opted for a slightly more cinematic approach to its story telling, switching to third-person perspective during dialogue scenes and introducing a fully voiced protagonist - the latter drawing complaints from fans that felt the decision had forced the developer to limit the breadth and depth of conversation options compared to those seen in previous games.

Since this news came to light, some have been voicing concerns that Diablo 4 may go down the same route as Diablo Immortal and have some kind of mobile-like monetisation and microtransactions attached to it. 
In response, several of its developers have swiftly jumped in to try and quell any anxiety within the Diablo community.
"To be clear, [Diablo 4] is a full price game built for PC/PS/Xbox audiences," franchise exec Rod Fergusson tweeted yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US launch of PlayStation Plus Premium has begun, and Sony has added many more titles to the service versus its previous rollout in parts of Asia.


This includes dozens more games for the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium's game catalogue of PS4 and PS5 titles, such as: Dead Cells, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Frostpunk: Console Edition, John Wick Hex, Little Nightmares, Nioh, Prey, Shenmue 3, Soulcalibur 6, Surgeon Simulator, Telling Lies, Tropico 5, Trine 4, plus The Dark Pictures Anthology's Little Hope and Man of Medan. 


The list of games available in the US looks to be a large upgrade from the list of games available in Hong Kong, for example. But there are some games (Journey to the Savage Planet) listed as available in Asia but not in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 was the highlight of last week's not-E3, with playable booths at Summer Game Fest drawing the biggest crowds while the developers were on-hand to answer questions and outline specifics of the return of Capcom's beloved series. Well, they've been answering some questions, while some other areas still remain bizarrely unclear. 


Crossplay has been a hope for the game since its reveal - something supported on Street Fighter 5 across PC and PlayStation, with Street Fighter 6 promising to bring Xbox players into the fold - and early reports from showgoers including fighting game YouTuber Maximillian Dood seemingly confirmed it would be included.


When pushed for clarity on the issue, however, Capcom was unwilling to confirm the matter. "In terms of crossplay we're going to have more information and more specifics to share down the line," a Capcom representative told Eurogamer at Summer Game Fest. "It's something we feel strongly about but in terms of actual specifics that will come at a later time."

Of course, Kojima most recently partnered with PlayStation for Death Stranding - and fans of that game are now expecting a Death Stranding sequel, thanks to the loose lips of actor and star Norman Reedus. 


Kojima's partnership with Sony was a major coup for PlayStation, and was announced with glee by its then-head Andy House. Kojima's appearance on last night's Microsoft and Bethesda Showcase, introduced by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, held similar vibes.

And not only did we get to see some more of this glorious gameplay in motion, we also got the news that its demo is now available to download on Steam.
The full game is slated to release sometime this year, although at the time of writing no further specifics were given.
Agent 64: Spies Never Die is all very James Bond GoldenEye a la the Nintendo 64 era, from the music and the weapons to the settings. There is even footage of the shooter - I assume the titular Agent 64 - finishing someone off in a toilet stall. Small me is very happy to see this and will most likely be heading to Steam to download the demo once I have finished work for the evening. You can check out the new trailer for yourself below.

Cloudpunk, which released back in 2020, was an experience I enjoyed a lot after it received a number of much-needed post-launch nips and tucks, revelling in the chance to play out all my Blade Runner fantasies by careening around its stunningly designed, neon-drenched futuristic city of Nivalis in my trusty flying car.


The biggest disappointment was that Nivalis proved to be rather lifeless at ground level, which is where Cloudpunk's spin-off comes in, attempting to turn the city from a pretty backdrop into a rich, meaningful world of its own as you attempt to build a business up from scratch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios, the developer behind the acclaimed likes of Frostpunk and This War of Mine, has unveiled its latest project, sci-fi survival adventure The Alters.


Unfortunately, it's early days as far as specifics go, with the bulk of 11 Bit's reveal taking the form of a cinematic trailer - one immediately bringing Duncan Jones' celebrated sci-fi movie Moon to mind. You see, in The Alters, players take on the role of Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant planet, ensconced in a roving wheel-like base, with a bunch of alternative versions of himself known as Alters. Ultimately, the goal is to stay alive long enough to find a way back home by creating new Alters, each of who have different skills essential for survival.


"The Alters is a game about life-changing moments," explains The Alters' new Steam page. "Those binary decisions that happen in nanoseconds, but have influence over your entire life. It is about looking into yourself, into your past, and discovering that you are who you are as a sum of those numerous choices. And when you do that a fundamental question arises: WHAT IF...?".

First discussed prior to Sea of Thieves' launch, the Captaincy Update was originally set to be one of the game's first post-launch updates, giving Pirate Legends the ability create their own legendary ship and forge a fearsome identity for themselves on the waves. They'd also start each session within the Legendary Hideout, blasting through its waterfall to make a grand entrance on the main map.


Unfortunately, following Sea of Thieves' rocky launch, Rare announced it would be placing the Captaincy update "on the back burner" while it refocussed its development. Since then, the Captaincy update has become the stuff of legends itself, many assuming it was lost to time.

You play as a kind of fly-person, who carries various glowing spheres around various exotic worlds. It's wonderfully moody, the opening desert hinting at some Sable-like vibes before we move on to a range of other ones, "worlds within worlds" as the blurb puts it. Even from just the trailer you get the sense there's some real cleverness to the puzzle-platforming to go with it.
Looks good! You can "unravel a cosmic mystery" in it next year, as it's coming 2023, like an awful lot of games it seems, on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield's delay was some of the biggest news to come this year, but alas not a surprise. After all, we had only been shown concept art with every teaser so far. Thankfully though, we now have our first look at some actual gameplay.
The gameplay starts off on the mysterious moon of Kreet and sees robot companion VASCO making his way out of the starship. Then, of course, we see some aliens, other space things and some combat. All the while, the swelling score is ticking along nicely in the background. We also pop over to New Atlantis at one point.
But you're not here to listen to me waffling on. You're here to see it for yourself. So, without further ado, here is our first look at gameplay for Starfield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight's Xbox and Bethesda Showcase brought confirmation of Microsoft's new partnership with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima. 


Details were thin on the ground - really, there was nothing here which had not been reported already - but tonight Microsoft made it official. 


Kojima is working on a brand new project with Xbox which will harness the company's cloud technology. If this sounds familiar, well, it's a promise we've heard before, and a detail which first found its way online last summer, when whispers of Kojima working with Microsoft first hit the internet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We didn't see this one coming: renowned role-playing game developer Obsidian is releasing a brand new game called Pentiment this November on Xbox consoles, PC and the cloud.
It's a narrative-focused murder mystery set in medieval times, and the action takes place on the pages of an era-appropriate book. It certainly looks different to everything else out there.
The game is led by Obsidian star director Josh Sawyer (Fallout: new Vegas, Pillars of Eternity) and is apparently an idea he pitched years and years ago at Black Isle Studios, according to IGN, which interviewed Sawyer about his new game.

Grounded has been available in early access for PC and Xbox since July 2020, miniaturising players - in true Honey, I Shrunk the Kids fashion - down to bug height and sending them off on an 80s-themed survival adventure through an ordinary backyard.


There's building, crafting, spiders the size of trucks (at least from your miniaturised perspective), and a whole lot more to experience as you - along with a couple of friends if you like - fight to find a way to return to human size.

It's a turn-based grand strategy game, from Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide Games, and the angle seems to be: Civilization, but with an emphasis on alternate history.
Think snow-capped Pyramids, steampunk future-cities, and blimps, of course, because who doesn't love a good blimp.

Described as an action strategy game, this 2023 release sees you run about slashing away at Minecraft enemies in a bid to unite Minecraft's overworld, whatever that means. 


Still, it looks intriguing and if it's half as fun as Mojang's Minecraft Dungeons, will be worth a try. As you'd expect, it's coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and will launch for PC via Windows Store and Steam, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft showed a new trailer for A Plage Tale: Requiem during the Games Showcase today, giving us another rare look at gameplay in the upcoming sequel, due sometime this year on Xbox Consoles, PC and Game Pass at launch. It's also coming to PS5 but obviously Microsoft glossed over that bit.
The thing that really stuck out to me, a fan of the first game, was stabbing. Amicia, the returning older sister of brother Hugo, and our hero, can now approach enemies from the back and stealth-kill them, reaching over and stabbing them multiple times in the neck - the kind of gruesome move we've seen many times in other stealth combat games. Except A Plague Tale, the first game, wasn't really a stealth combat game - it was more about running away and hiding and being smart. That's what made it stand out. 
Amicia also packs a crossbow in the sequel, which she uses, and she can garrotte people with some chord. All she had in the first game was a slingshot, which wasn't entirely capable of one-shot kills. It was more of a utility/distraction tool.

Microsoft hasn't revealed how the Pelican will fit into the overall Flight Simulator experience just yet, but you can get a gimpse of the ship in the trailer below. It's a different story for the free 40th Anniversary Edition update, however, which has been detailed in significantly more detail.
Described as a "comprehensive celebration of the franchise", it promises to pay tribute to the series' past as well as introduce new aircraft types. The latter additions include the long-awaited arrival of helicopters and gliders, brought to life with a new Fluid Dynamics Simulation.

As well as this, Forza Motorsport will also be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass subscription service on day one.
Along with this announcement, Dan Greenawalt and the game's director Chris Esaki popped in for a chat about their game. It's the most technically advanced racing game ever apparently, so that's exciting. We also got told about its dynamic time of day feature, the weather for each track and the inclusion of raytracing. This was all shown off with a clip from the fictional circuit known as Maple Valley.
The twosome also says there's a 48x improvement in the accuracy of the simulation - but, as Martin has asked, what does that mean, and how does it feel? I guess we won't find out for a while.

Redfall's the work of Arkane Austin, and today's overview mixed up a bit of gameplay with a look at the playable characters. We start approaching a spooky church and then head up into the spire where vampires are leaping about. Shotguns and nice vampire-burning-up effects ensue, and then we're off to learn a bit about the town.


The titular Redfall is an island community in Massachusets apparently, but now the whole place has gone to heck. Vampires have blocked out the sun, drained all the water, and cut the town off. (Wouldn't draining the water do the opposite?) Expect spooky Americana, like a funfair and an old cinema which appears to have the wilderness growing inside. Expect Left 4 Dead-type action as you take on different enemy types.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost exactly a year after its announcement, Netflix has offered a first tiny glimpse of its animated, French-Revolution-era Castlevania spin-off, revealing its name to be Nocturne.


Castlevania: Nocturne will follow the adventures of two characters that should be immediately familiar to fans of the video games - Richter Belmont (a distant descendant of original Netflix series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - with its vampiric action playing out against the backdrop of the French Revolution, circa 1792.


 Powerhouse, the studio behind Netflix's original animated Castlevania series will once again be on animation duties for Nocturne, with Kevin Kolde serving as showrunner and Clive Bradley being credited as "creator/writer".

Season one of The Cuphead Show was well-received when it launched earlier this year, proving to be a hugely enjoyable adaptation of Studio MDHR's acclaimed run-and-gunner. Cuphead's second season will, unsurprisingly, continues where its predecessor left often, featuring the further misadventures of Cuphead, Mugman, and friends on Inkwell Isle.
Season 2 will feature another 12 15-minute episodes, and a further 12 episodes will follow sometime after that, completing Netflix's previously confirmed three-season, 36 episode run.

How's it all been so far? Well, the PlayStation State of Play was pretty good, actually.


As for Geoff Keighley's show last night, well... there were plenty of announcements in last night's showcase, though few genuine surprises. Here we share our favourites, rate the night overall, and provide our best impressions of the Clickers from The Last of Us. Joining me, as ever, are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.


Of course, this year has seen the traditional E3 model splintered further - and we're still to see two platform holders take their turn in the spotlight. We'll be back next week to break down the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase, plus  perhaps even a Nintendo Direct. Thanks for watching, and have a lovely weekend!

As well as the monthly event's typical in-game bonuses and good chances at catching a Deino's Shiny version, developer Niantic is also using the event to roll-out a couple of brand new features. 


In a twist, players will be able to extend the event's three-hour runtime in their local area by raiding at gyms after the 11am-2pm window concludes. The raids will feature Deino's evolved form Zweilous, and hatch from a new type of raid egg that can only be tackled by players in person (so, no remote raid passes!).

Ahead of this reveal, we also got our first look at the price - $70 - via a leak online. That in itself was enough to cause many to raise an eyebrow, as while the game certainly does look smoother thanks to its current gen make-over, it is also a game that has been released twice before.
Today, we now have even more information on this release, such as the three editions that will be released. And I am sorry to say this folks, but that £70/$70 will only get you the base game and its prequel Left Behind. If you want to get your hands on the The Last of Us Part 1's  Digital Deluxe edition, you are going to have to part ways with £80/$80. Meanwhile, if you are looking to purchase The Last of Us Part I Firefly Edition, which is only available to buy as an exclusive directly from PlayStation in the US, you are looking at just shy of $100.
So, what exactly do you get with these editions to make them worth the money?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Geoff Keighley's big Summer Game Fest showcase might be over, but there are still plenty of announcements where that came from. Indeed, those that stuck around once Keighley had done his thing this evening would have immediately been greeted by a slew of intriguing new indie titles, courtesy of this year's Day of the Devs showcase - and if you missed it, the whole thing can be perused in one convenient, easily digestible round-up below. 

Time Flies


Time Flies is the work of Michael Frei and Mario von Rickenbach, the developers behind the acclaimed Kids, and explores the limited time we have on Earth from the perspective of a fly. After entering your location, you're allotted a set amount of time (based on your country's average life expectancy) to explore the inside of a house and puzzle out ways to complete a bucket list of activities, ranging from getting rich to making a friend. Time Flies is coming to Playstation, Switch, PC, and Mac next year.

For the curious, Darktide is a spiritual follow-up to Fatshark's previous four-player co-op games, Warhammer: Vermintide and Vermintide 2, which are a bit like medieval Left 4 Deads but with giant rats. This one's set in the even grimmer and darker universe of the year 40K.
And it's all quite supremely 40K, by the looks of things. We get a nice glimpse of the four classes - Psyker, Veteran, Zealot, Ogryn - blowing apart the hordes of cultists-cum-space-zombies in different ways.

Baker and Johnson, who play Joel and Ellie in Naughty Dog's games, took to the stage during Summer Game Fest alongside The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann. Here, the duo revealed that, while they can't say which characters they will be playing, they are very excited to be part of the show. They also introduced the leaked PlayStation 5 remake of Part 1 officially. You can see the trailer for it below.

Its not much, but Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann has revealed a new piece of concept art (see the image above) for it and said it will be as big as any single-player game the team has done, if not bigger – which given the size of Part 2 is quite the claim! 
This multiplayer will have its own storyline and it takes place in another part of the United States. Is that the Golden Gate Bridge we can see over there? Hmm. Why, yes. Yes, I think it is.

Layers of Fears, to give the new experience its official (and faintly ridiculous) name, has been co-developed with Anshar Studios, and sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 to form what Bloober is calling a "psychological horror chronicle" - complete with new visuals, gameplay, and expanded plot lines.


Bloober says these new story elements will "cast a new light on the overarching narrative" as players face "spine-chilling madness that extends over generations."

American Arcadia, which was initially teased earlier this year, takes place in a retro-futuristic metropolis where the citizens have no idea they're actually contestants on the most watched reality show on the planet.


What follows is a daring escape - presented as a documentary, complete with interviews and police interrogations - as players take control of two different characters in two different locations, each with their own playstyles.

It is a colourful and playfully chunky looking strategy game, but one with a somber undertone.

It also features a city called Alphaville, so yes, while I am writing this up, I am also singing Big in Japan. 
Here is the trailer for you to enjoy yourself.

We've known about this for a while, but we've just got a proper glimpse of the game  at Geoff's Summer Games Fest thing. I say proper glimpse -  the trailer's stylish but tricky to read too much into. There's lots of mantling and side-on platforming and the suggestion that physics and big robots both play a part, so that's all okay with us.


Flashback 2 will be out this Winter on all the consoles and PC by the looks of it. Microids is in charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight brought a look at a gameplay mission from Infinity Ward's upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, as part of the Geoff Keighley-fronted Summer Game Fest.


If you're not up to date, this is the sequel to the 2019 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which rebooted the series and re-imagined some of its popular characters.


Here we find them boarding a ship and getting into all sorts of shooty business. There's a bit of that fancy water which Wes reported on in his earlier look at the game, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Its Summer Game Fest time, and things have been kicked off with a trip into outer space. Yes, we have our first look at Dead Space 4. Sorry, I mean The Callisto Protocol (easy mistake to make).
As you would expect, it is a bloody horror filled rampage against some pretty ugly looking fellas. I am talking limbs coming off left, right and centre. There is also a look at a gravity gun in use, and our protagonist stomping down on a felled enemy's corpse (because you just would if that thing came at you!). 
We also get to see, erm, well, someone getting trapped in a fan of sorts, resulting in them getting mushed up. To sum up, it's unpleasant, clausterphobic and, won't lie, I'm here for it. See what you think for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those pesky Xenomorphs are heading back PC and consoles next year in the newly announced Aliens: Dark Descent.


Coming from developer Tindalos Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment, Aliens: Dark Descent is described as a "squad-based, single-player action game" that sees players commanded their soldiers in real-time as they take on Xenomorphs - including Facehuggers, Praetorians, and Alien Queens - as well as rogue operatives from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.


"Infiltrate large open levels and annihilate enemies with your squad, dispatching orders strategically and intuitively at the touch of a button," the game's newly launched Steam page explains. "Tread carefully, as your foes will adapt their tactics to your actions while hunting you down because death is permanent. Forge unique paths for survival, uncovering shortcuts, creating safe zones, and setting up motion trackers in a persistent world where your actions impact levels forever."

Moss: Book 2, which picks up immediately after the events of the first game, once again builds its action around a hybrid of first-person and third-person perspectives as players, in the role of an omniscient spirit, help guide mouse protagonist Quill on her quest to free the land from the clutches of the evil Arcane.


Polyarc's sequel initially launched for PSVR earlier this year, and Eurogamer's resident virtual reality aficionado Ian Higton was delighted to revisit the series' cinematic blend of puzzling and combat in his glowing Moss: Book 2 review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of tonight's Summer Game Fest, Sony's The Last of Us Part 1 remake - one of the worst kept secrets in the industry today - has leaked. So yes, it is real. And not only is it really real, but it will also be releasing as soon as 2nd September for the PlayStation 5 at a retail price of $70. 
To accompany this news, we got our first look at the remake in action thanks to a brand-new trailer. You can check it out for yourself by following this link.
As you can see, the Ellie and Joel that we first met all the way back in 2013 now have a much sleeker look, but it is most certainly still them. There is fighting, there is compassion, and there are enough clickers to give one spores for thought throughout this reveal. Rather nicely, the game's DLC - Left Behind - will also be included in this remake.

And now it's out! Available to play on itch.io, the game offers a miniature green-tinged version of the Lands Between - or at least, the Precipice of Anticipation, Northern Limgrave, and Stormveil Castle - presented in a Zelda-inspired top-down fashion.


The game runs in-browser, but Shin recommends using real Game Boy hardware or an Analogue Pocket for saving, better colours, and higher accuracy.

Those considered civilians and civilian targets are not to be attacked by military forces; as they are not combatants, they should be spared. At the same time, they also should not act as combatants&#8212;­if they do, they may lose this status...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you think of CD Projekt Red and the word Cyberpunk together, you do get a certain thought in your head. Yes, we all get visions of that disastrous launch. However, this could all be about to change, as a new trailer and some bonus footage from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime has been revealed, and it looks pretty damn amazing in my eyes. 
The trailer, via Netflix, doesn't give much away in terms of story beats, but it certainly sets the scene. There is neon, there is angst, there are explostions and gunfire a plenty and, oh yes, there are motorbikes.

Pre-ordering the game for either PlayStation 4 or Xbox One will cost players £69.99. That's a hefty £10 increase from the asking for price for the franchise's last title: Vanguard. 


The price rise is explained by the fact players are now forced to purchase the "Cross-Gen Bundle," which includes both the last-gen and current-gen versions of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report into the development of Bethesda's widely derided Fallout 76 has painted a picture of a studio in disarray, as poor management, a lack of design direction, and engine challenges created an environment of apathy, confusion, crunch, and burnout, and a game that ultimately failed to resonate with players.


Announced in 2018 and launched the following year, Fallout 76 - an online take on Bethesda's beloved post-apocalyptic RPG series - was less than well-received at launch. Eurogamer's Wesley Yin-Poole even went as far as to call it a "bizarre, boring, broken mess" before slapping it with an avoid badge.


Now, a lengthy new report from Kotaku - based on conversations with 10 former employees of Bethesda and parent company ZeniMax Media - has shed fresh light on the troubled development that lead to such a poorly received game, one seemingly doomed from the start.

Word that Battlefield 2042's post-launch development has been dramatically downscaled was first shared by journalist Jeff Grubb on his Grubbsnax Giant Bomb show, where he claimed the remaining team has been tasked with delivering the four seasons of live service content promised to purchasers the "fastest and the cheapest it possibly can".


"This game is basically down to a skeleton crew," Grubb told viewers (thanks VGC). "It's down to like the bare bones and those people are specifically just working on the promised additional seasons that the game needs to meet the requirements of the high-end version that it sold."

That game went down as the last new PC Call of Duty to appear on Steam, with all subsequent mainline games (Black Ops 4, Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War and Vanguard), as well as free-to-play battle royale Warzone releasing on Battle.net exclusively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its unveiling back in March, developer ClockStone, the studio behind the popular Bridge Constructor series, has shared 16 minutes of gameplay from its upcoming diorama-based construction puzzler Lego Bricktales.


Lego Bricktales tasks players with traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they undertake various quests and puzzles dished out by NPCs to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


Bricktales' core puzzling is based around a brick-by-brick building mechanic that encourages players to find a solution to the task at hand by constructing something useful from a limited number of bricks - a bridge, perhaps, or a physics-based flying machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some players are finding themselves unable to access EA games on PlayStation and Xbox if their console accounts are tied to an EA account with an expired password.


The problem centres around the fact that many players created EA accounts in the distant past - for one reader who got in contact, it was over a decade ago - and tied it to an email address that has long since been shut down. For anyone with a now-abandoned school or work email, it's a similar story. 


Now, when EA's account system asks for a password reset, it can only send an email to that lost address.

Along with this news, we also have a brand-new trailer to enjoy. Expect plenty of chaos to unfold here, as we meet gunslinging ornery cowboy type Jesse Rentier. 

 To my eyes, Evil West looks like a mashup of Red Dead Redemption and Resident Evil but with more lightning. See what you think  below.

However, there is a catch. This will just be its beta (or "flight" in the words of developer 343 industries), and not the real deal. That is still slated to come some time later this year.
If you want to have a shot at this test flight, you will have to register to become a Halo Insider. This program is the "official way for Halo fans and community members to partner with 343 Industries to help improve our games, products, and services."

Former Giantbomb host Jeff Gerstmann discussed what he'd seen of the game last night via Twitch, and suggested it was far enough along in development it could potentially be revealed as part of Microsoft's Xbox and Bethesda Showcase on Sunday. 


As for the game itself, which Gerstmann said was currently in testing, it puts players in command of a "Steve-like" unit that directs others to fight off Minecraft enemies such as Piglins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is reportedly figuring out what to do with a completed sequel to party game 1-2-Switch that has "tested horribly" among its target audience.


According to Fanbyte writer Imran Khan, citing multiple sources familiar with the game's development, Nintendo made the decision to begin work on a 1-2-Switch sequel - reportedly known as Everybody's 1-2-Switch - after the the original shifted a respectable 3.45m copies.


After several iterations, Nintendo is said to have settled on an idea inspired by the Jackbox Party Pack series for its 1-2-Switch sequel, where multiple players (up to 100 in some cases) could use their smartphones to compete in game-show-like mini-game challenges hosted by a man in a rubber horse mask. Reportedly, this somewhat radical shift in focus for the series was to ensure a too-similar sequel didn't eat into the original mini-game compilation's ongoing sales.

Proceedings get underway at 6pm BST/10am PT next Monday, 13th June, and will continue until the following Monday, 20th June. That'll give you seven days to gorge on as many demos as possible (an increasingly daunting proposition the bigger Steam Next Fest gets), after which they'll disappear once more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima, designer of the legendary Metal Gear series and 2019's Death Stranding, is reportedly working on a new horror game starring actress Margaret Qualley called Overdose.


That's according to ceaseless leaker Tom Henderson, who, writing for Try Hard Guides, claims to have been sent early footage featuring a character - portrayed by Qualley, who previously played Mama in Death Stranding - roaming through dark corridors with a flashlight in her hand.


Henderson says the sequence (displayed from a third-person perspective, although a first-person mode is also rumoured) culminates in a jump scare that brings a Game Over message up on screen. That's reportedly followed by the caption "A Hideo Kojima Game... OVERDOSE".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With E3 yet again absent from the gaming calendar and Geoff Keighley readying to return this week with his Summer Game Fest alternative, the ESA has re-emerged with a reminder it's planning to bring E3 back as both a digital and in-person event next year.


E3's future has been looking increasingly uncertain in recent times, given the ESA's continuing struggle to adequately adapt the show in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The event has been cancelled twice in the last three years - first in 2020 and again this year - with 2021's virtual event proving to be a decidedly lacklustre affair.


But even before coronavirus, E3's domination of the gaming calendar was growing ever-more wobbly, as an increasing number of publishers - including Sony, EA, and Activision - all abandoned the show in order to focus on their own bespoke events outside of the E3 umbrella.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft's long-awaited The Wild Update arrives today and finally adds the game's intriguing Deep Dark biome: a fresh slab of world for you to explore, underneath the game's previously-permanent bedrock. It adds new enemies, fancy new building blocks and some odd new structures, left by past explorers. It's something fans have been wanting to dig into for some time.


Mojang originally announced Deep Dark almost two years ago, back at Minecraft Live in 2020. At the time, the biome was set to be part of the game's 2021 Caves and Cliffs Update (an offering that was further reshuffled after Caves and Cliffs was split in two). So, why the delay? What's been happening with Minecraft in the interim? And what's going on with that Jason Momoa Minecraft movie? I sat down with Minecraft's game director Agnes Larsson and gameplay developer Ulraf Vakninthe to find out more.


"We felt for a while 'this is a risk but we might be able to do it'," Larsson told me, of Deep Dark's original intended release date. "But then when we realised [we had to delay], we tried to take the decision really quickly because we would risk making people in the team very, very stressed out. And we also communicated about it really quickly because we wanted to be as transparent as possible about such a big decision.

Back in February, Bowser was told he would serve 40 months behind bars - more than three years - after pleading guilty to his part in the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices.


Now, newly-detailed documentation dug up by Axios and Kotaku has revealed how Nintendo's lawyers and US district judge Robert Lasnik discussed Bowser's jail time as a means to set an example - even as Bowser's own lawyers argued his physical health was at risk, and argued that Bowser had already spent 16 months locked up awaiting trial.

This drive for unionisation comes amid a wider push for video game worker unions in the US, and after a previous squabble between staff and Keywords bosses over returning to work in-office.

The Capcom Showcase will run for around 35 minutes, and feature "news and in-depth updates" on "previously-announced Capcom titles".


That's a nice bit of expectation-setting, then - don't expect reveals of unannounced games. Then again, there's still plenty Capcom has now revealed which it can discuss in more detail: including the "reimagined" Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6.

In fact, Epic is calling in its lawyers to shut the whole thing down
A series of tweets between the CEO and the Fortnite Token account reveal the full extent of Sweeny's disdain for the cryptocurrency market (at least when it comes to Fortnite).
"There isn't a Fortnite cryptocurrency," he stated "The Twitter accounts promoting such a thing are a scam. Epic's lawyers are on it."

DICE has, of course, been steadily working to improve Battlefield 2042 since its launch last November, when it quickly become one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time. While the developer has committed to bringing this latest Battlefield "up to the highest standards that we all hold for the franchise", it's only now, some eight months after its release, that players will finally get a first look at the game's long-delayed first season of post-launch content.
Those curious to see what DICE has in store for Battlefield 2042's first season, known as Zero Hour, will be able to see its gameplay premiere tomorrow, Tuesday 7th June at 4pm/8am PDT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed point-and-click specialist Wadjet Eye Games - the studio behind the likes of Unavowed and the celebrated Blackwell series - has unveiled its latest contribution to the genre, time-travelling adventure Old Skies.


Old Skies cast players as Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency tasked with keeping a close eye on seven travellers who've paid for a sightseeing jaunt to the past. "Some are simply curious," explains Wadjet Eye. "Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."


Wadjet Eye is promising seven distinct time periods from history to explore - "from the speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age to the morning of September 11th" - with puzzles set to take advantage of the game's temporal premise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's live-action adaptation of Capcom's survival horror classic Resident Evil has received another trailer ahead of its 14th July release.


The new live-action series - not to be confused with Netflix's four-episode CGI effort Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, which launched last year - splits its Racoon-City-focused storyline across two distinct timelines, straddling either side of a global apocalypse caused by a deadly virus.


At one end, pre-apocalypse, we follow the adventures of teenage sisters Jade and Billie Wesker as they begin to notice strange things are afoot in New Racoon City. Then, 14 years later in 2036, Jade takes centre-stage as she struggles to survive in a world overrun by the blood-thirsty infected and ponders the fate of her sister.

Ahead of its airing, however, host Geoff Keighley has warned viewers expecting major reveals to "manage your expectations", saying the event will be "primarily focused" on already announced games.


Speaking during a Twitter Spaces audio session over the weekend (as transcribed by VGC), Keighley said he was "very excited" about the titles set to feature during Thursday's Summer Game Fest, but warned viewers to "definitely manage your expectations in terms of the megaton shocks that you’re expecting. This is not The Game Awards."


"We’ve got lots of good stuff to show you," he added, "but buyer beware of some of the crazy rumours I'm seeing out there in terms of things people expect to get announced."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The climbing mechanic in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End almost saw lithe hero Nathan Drake come with his own little stamina bar in a bid to give an extra layer of difficulty to the game.
Naughty Dog's Josh Scherr, who co-wrote A Thief's End with Neil Druckmann and then went on to co-write The Lost Legacy, was a guest on YouTube channel Couch Soup over the weekend. Here, Scherr shared more about his illustrious career with Naughty Dog (which has spanned over 20 years) and gave some behind the scenes insight into Uncharted 4's development.
Scherr praised the power of PlayStation 4, and said it was "specifically designed to not be super complicated with a cell processor and six SPUs and all that other crazy stuff", likening it to a "fancy version of a high-end PC". This means more time for developers to focus on other areas of a game sooner, such as its story development.

However, while great, these games are a product of their time, and as such can look a little rough around the edges. Well, not anymore!
Now, thanks to an emulator developer that goes by the name of Darío, these legendary games have been given not only ray-tracing upgrades, but also object motion blur, widescreen, DLSS and 60+ FPS.

Last season's underground base is now a giant rave cavern, with a rollercoaster you can ride using the game's returning Baller vehicles (think those spheres from Jurassic World). 


A large chunk of the Island has also been transformed into a punk-fantasy jungle, with an enormous bioluminescent tree you can scamper around.

However, despite sharing a name, an overarching concept and a pretty close launch window, these two have no relation to each other what's so ever. Huh.
"Message from the Belfry: the #GothamKnights game and the upcoming TV show of the same name are separate projects with no connection to one another," Batman Arkham Oranges developer Warner Bros. Montreal tweeted. "We can't wait for you to experience the action of our Gotham Knights soon."

        <updated>2022-06-05T22:06:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Go Fest, Pokémon Go's annual summer weekend extravangaza, has shaken up the game with the introduction of a new Mythical creature, the arrival of the franchise's extra-dimensional Ultra Beasts, and the apparent (albeit likely temporary) loss of everyone's favourite hunky professor, Willow.


The disappearance of Willow, a surprise twist for the game's second day, means the game has been left without its usual friendly face guiding players through the game's story. A mysterious stranger named Rhi, who looks to be a new ally, has instead taken Willow's place while players investigate the emergence of the first Ultra Beasts. 


These creatures are likely the cause of Willow's absence, and will hopefully be a continued focus over the game's new Season of Go. For now at least, Willow's absence appears to be a story development that will stick for some time, with standard in-game text changed throughout the app to remove references to the professor. (For those overly concerned, a Go Fest finale event for existing ticket holders, coming in August, seems likely to revolve around his revival.)

In an interview with Famitsu, Okunari said - as paraphrased by Gosokkyu (thanks, NintendoLife) - the company did "explore the idea" of a Dreamcast or Saturn Mini but ultimately decided not to pursue it when Sega discovered manufacturing mini consoles had become more expensive post-pandemic (and post semiconductor shortage, of course).

Okunari added that the Mega Drive Mini's internals "can't adequately handle Saturn games", and manufacturing new chipsets would be prohibitively expensive, joking that if they'd proceeded with the idea, the cost of buying a Dreamcast of Saturn Mini could rival that of a modern-day console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It costs £88,000 ($110,000) to fully upgrade a character in Diablo Immortal.

That's according to Bellular News (thanks, GameRant), which has calculated that to fully max out a character, a player would need to spend over $100,000 on microtransactions, as it's seemingly not possible to do so without spending real money. You can check out the full breakdown below:

Players in Diablo Immortal have three progression pillars: XP level, equipment level, and Legendary Gems. The first two are pretty standard fare in any RPG-type game, but collating Legendary Gems can be a costly and convoluted process as the way you get them is randomised and often exceedingly rare... and right now, it seems as though F2P players cannot earn them at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Games has entered into a new publishing agreement with Disruptive Games, a Californian indie studio, to publish its "upcoming online multiplayer action-adventure game".

The press release stops short of detailing much else about the upcoming game - details will be "revealed at a later date", apparently, although a quick snoop on Disruptive's website hints that it's coming to PC as well as unspecified PlayStation and Xbox consoles - but Disruptive Games has worked on several notable titles, including Diablo II: Resurrected, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, and Godfall. 

The studio says it is now focused on "multiplayer-first gaming experiences that immerse players in living worlds".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More reports have surfaced suggesting upcoming PS5 game Abandoned is "not actively being worked on" and "there is no game" in development.

The claims come from GameSpot , which alleges it has information directly from a private Discord server through which Hasan Kahraman of Blue Box Game Studios, Abandoned's director, communicates with a handful of selected fans. 

In exchange for access to "screenshots, animations, and even a page of the game's script", the members are required to sign a NDA, so some would only speak about the project under strict anonymity. Should any member of the server press Kahraman - who is described as "duplicitous and prone to mood swings" - for clarification or more details, they risk being banned from the small community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like pre-orders for Marvel's Midnight Suns are about to go live ahead of an October release date.

That's according to a new leak - which the source insists was obtained via an anonymous online retailer - that seemingly backs up prior claims that the game is set to release on 6th October and will be available in three flavours: a standard, enhanced, and legendary edition.

The claims may have flown entirely under the radar, but the images accompanying the leaker's tweets - thought to have been box art - have all been zapped with a copyright notice from a senior legal assistant at Take-Two, leading many to believe they are genuine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's latest season has concluded with this year's first big live event, as the battle royale Island's heroes aimed to end the villainous Imagined Order faction for good. 


Starting off the event, players found themselves in groups of up to four people inside Fortnite's bear mech for the first time. Here, you could peer out from its bridge and onto an unfamiliar landscape - an icy moon which orbits the main Fortnite Island - and play around with gun turrets while listening to brief audio chatter between heroes Jones (Troy Baker), The Origin (Rahul Kohli) and The Foundation (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson).


With a minute to go, a mission briefing finally re-introduced the mech's pilot The Paradigm and laid out the stakes: the evil IO were set to detonate a superweapon capable of killing everyone, and it was up to you inside the mech to stop it. (Never mind that this is your goal in each battle royale match.) So off we went, blasting into space, through an asteroid field, and towards our best view of the Fortnite island floating through the multiverse yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has announced it is "no longer targeting a FY23 release" for its troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.
Following rumours that The Sands of Time remake - which has moved release date several times now - was being delisted at some major retailers, Ubisoft released a brief statement confirming the game has formally been "delisted" as the game's latest development studio, Ubisoft Montreal "continue[s] the work to deliver a great remake".

The Sands of Time remake was being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai, but the project has been dogged by setbacks since its unveiling in September 2020. Shortly after its announcement, Ubisoft moved its launch date from January 2021 to March that same year, but February brought a second delay, this time indefinitely, while the team worked on delivering "a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original".

Given the guests, it wasn't a stretch to presume the secret new project may have something to do with a new Sega retro console - and it turns out that's exactly what Sega was teasing.

As yet, we don't have any information on English social media, but the reveal has been posted to Sega Japan's official YouTube channel, which you can check out below:

"Gamescom is a key event in Nintendo’s calendar of events," Nintendo said in a statement to Games Wirtschaft (thanks, VGC). "This year, however, after careful consideration, we have decided against participating in Cologne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space creator Glen Schofield's very Dead-Space-like sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol finally has a release date and is heading to PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC on 2nd December this year.


The Callisto Protocol, which was officially unveiled back in December 2020, is a third-person horror game set in 2320. Its action unfolds within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter's moon Callisto, and - needless to say - suffocating terror and "terrifying secrets" ensue.


We've only seen a single cinematic of The Callisto Protocol since its intriguing 2020 reveal, so it's nice to finally, properly see the thing in action courtesy of its brand-new release date trailer - which includes a smattering of gameplay - below. It looks like appropriately atmospheric, deliciously icky stuff - and, yes, not entirely dissimilar to Dead Space.

Horizon Call of the Mountain, which was announced back in January, is a first-person experience set the series' gorgeous, post-apocalypse world. It casts players as a new character -  Ryas, a former Shadow Carja Warrior who hopes to redeem himself by investigating a grave threat to the Sundom - and sets them on an adventure featuring main series protagonist Aloy and a host of other familiar faces.


Call of the Mountain's new trailer, revealed during tonight's PlayStation State of Play, offers a first proper look at the game in action - including some of the activities players will be able to partake in using Sony's upgraded VR kit, such as archery and mountain climbing - and it would be an understatement to say it all looks spectacular indeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Casting for Sony's live-action Twisted Metal series continues, with the news that Will Arnett - known for the likes of BoJack Horseman, The Lego Batman Movie, and Arrested Development - will voice the role of insane clown Sweet Tooth.


According to Variety, the show's version of the iconic Sweet Tooth is a "hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning. A lover of chaos, this majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses 'Lost Vegas' as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck."


The Twisted Metal series - a half-hour action comedy scripted by Cobra Kai writer Michael Jonathan Smith for Peacock - follows a motor-mouthed outsider, played by Anthony Mackie, who's offered a chance at a better life as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland dominated by savage marauders driving vehicles of destruction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yesterday's brief gameplay tease, Sega has released a considerably more substantial seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay, offering a much clearer look at how the hedgehog's first foray into open-world platforming will likely play out.


Yesterday's footage was perhaps most notable for the rather muted art style Sega has opted for this time around, with the game - at least from what we've seen so far - placing Sonic in a realistically hewn world that almost feels closer to the sodden, boulder-pocked hillsides of Death Stranding than it does the colour-blasted Sonic backdrops of old.


We get to see a lot more of that expansive landscape in Sega's newly shared seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay (thanks IGN), with the bulk of the footage focused on leisurely exploration as Sonic roams around, solving puzzles to unlock new elements in the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo Immortal - Blizzard's free-to-play take on its long-running dungeon crawler series - has started its global roll-out, and is now available to download on iOS and Android devices in certain territories.


First announced at BlizzCon in 2018 - where it was less than warmly received by attendees - Diablo Immortal takes place between the events of Diablo 2 and 3, adapting the classic dungeon crawling formula of its predecessors for mobile devices - which, among other things, means a free-to-play monetisation model based around in-app purchases.


Starting out in the city of Westmarch, players can adopt one of six classes - Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Crusader, Necromancer, or Demon Hunter - and journey out to explore eight areas along with other adventurers. Blizzard and co-developer NetEase have previously said additional zones, storylines, loot, and classes will be added over time.

Last year, Xbox created a limited number of Pride controllers but many players wanted it to be universally available. This year's controller will therefore be customisable in the Xbox Design Lab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On 16th June, those who own either a Nintendo Switch, an Xbox or a PlayStation will be able to get their hands on the formally PC exclusive and BAFTA winning Autonauts. 
For those who don't know already, Autonauts is a game where you build and then train robots to automate the world around you. Sounds easy enough, but there is a catch. In short, these robots are only ever going to be as smart as you tell them to be.
It is up to you as the player to teach your bots what do. You will need to upgrade them and expand their brains as the game progresses, opening up their full operational potential. You can build dozens of different workerbots on your planet and make it a "fully functioning home" with their help. By fully functioning home, we are talking cooking, mining, construction, you name it.

Speaking of the game's world, this will be the first Pokémon role-playing game where you can freely explore the entire map from the off - and "not in an order dictated by the story", as The Pokémon Company clarified today. 


"Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet allow multiplayer gameplay with up to four players," The Pokémon Company said. "Along with series staples, such as trading and battling Pokémon, you will be able to explore the various locations of the region in these games with other players. You can discover new Pokémon and explore unfamiliar areas with your friends and family, opening the door to an adventure more precious and fun than ever!"

The group has now shared a public document (via Kotaku) detailing its investigation and subsequent evidence against Ricciardi. This document states: "If you have received games from [Ricciardi], check them closely and compare with known originals. I advise to presume they are fake, because our investigation has unearthed quite a bit more alleged forgeries than real."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PC gamers rejoice!  God of War on PC has been updated to support AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.0. 


For those of you out of the loop, I highly recommend you give Digital Foundry's explainer a read, where Alex Battaglia explains it much more eloquently than I ever could. 


In short, FSR 2.0 is a suite of image upscaling technologies which let your PC run the game at a lower internal resolution, which is then reconstructed to be close to indistinguishable from its native resolution.

Author: Paris Pittman (Steering Committee)
Last year, we published our first Annual Report Summary for 2020 and it's already time for our second edition!
2021 Annual Report Summary
This summary reflects the work that has been done in 2021 and the initiatives on deck for the rest of 2022. Please forward to organizations and indidviduals participating in upstream activities, planning cloud native strategies, and/or those looking to help out. To find a specific community group's complete report, go to the kubernetes/community repo under the groups folder. Example: sig-api-machinery/annual-report-2021.md
You’ll see that this report summary is a growth area in itself. It takes us roughly 6 months to prepare and execute, which isn’t helpful or valuable to anyone as a fast moving project with short and long term needs. How can we make this better?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yu Suzuki - the legendary designer behind the likes of Sega classics Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, OutRun, and Space Harrier - has unveiled new 3D shooter Air Twister, which is making its way to Apple Arcade on 24th June.


Air Twister is a fantasy "swipe" shooter - developed by Shenmue 3 studio YS Net - that asks players, in the role of Princess Arch, to battle alien invaders and save their planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


As the trailer reveals, there's a definite Space Harrier vibe to the whole thing - with a touch of Panzer Dragoon thrown in when our lead takes to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and, according to an interview attended by GameSpot, Air Twister is based on a fantasy shooting game Yu Suzuki envisaged in the 80s, before he adapted the idea into Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

39 percent of UK adults aged 16 or over play games online, Ofcom says, with 56 percent of children aged three to 15 playing games online. The average time spent each week playing games online was 7 hours and 33 minutes, including PC, console, VR and smartphone gaming.


These figures come from Ofcom surveys completed in late 2021, so after formal lockdowns had ended, Ofcom noted. In general, there was a dip in the amount of time younger people played online games year-on-year, though a growth in time spent playing online games for those aged 55-64.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adeline Software's much-loved Little Big Adventure series can now be enjoyed with a welcome selection of modern day niceties - including cloud saves, controller support, and Steam achievements - thanks to a brand-new update on Steam.


The original Little Big Adventure - an evocative blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that followed young hero Twinsen as he attempted to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994 and was followed by a sequel three years later. Needless to say, at now over a quarter of a century old, both were decidedly lacking in modern day polish.


Developer 2.21, which now owns the rights to the series (and counts Little Big Adventure co-creator Didier Chanfray as a founder), announced it would be upgrading Little Big Adventure 1 & 2 back in March, although there was no estimated time of arrival for its enhancements.

Sonic Frontiers was first teased at the end of last May (with only the vaguest of CGI trailers and no name), but it wasn't until December that first proper details emerged, with Sega describing the title as Sonic's "first ever open zone" game.


"Accelerate to new heights and experience the thrill of high velocity open-zone freedom," the publisher said at the time. "Battle powerful enemies as you speed through the Starfall Islands - landscapes brimming with dense forests, overflowing waterfalls, sizzling deserts and more!".

THQ Nordic has revealed that Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is heading our way on 30th August, with alien invader Crypto - or to be more precise, the next Crypto: Cryptosporidium 138 - leading the charge (ok, so maybe "that planet burning kind" is actually still accurate...).
THQ has promised this release will be a faithful remake of 2006's alien filled caper, complete with "five huge open-world areas". These areas are Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and, what with this being a game with an out of this world entity roaming through its maps, the Moon. 
But, who exactly will players come across within these vast maps? Well, as Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is set in the swinging '60s, you will have to deal with more than a small handful of hippies on your quest for glory. Oh, yes, and there is also the small matter of the KGB as well. You can check out the latest trailer for Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed below.

"On the 24th of February 2022, our Heart of Russia team was some six to eight weeks away from completing work on the highly anticipated new DLC. We all felt really good about the result; a lot of effort had been invested in making this new region look truly fantastic in the game," SCS shared in a blog post yesterday.
"We were absolutely sure that our community, especially those in Russia, would really appreciate that. Then, all of a sudden, the entire world was rocked by the news that Ukraine had been invaded by Russia."

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Although cyber conflict has existed for thirty years, the strategic utility of cyber operations remains unclear. Many expect cyber operations to provide independent utility in both warfare and low-intensity competition. Underlying these expectations are broadly shared assumptions that information technology increases operational effectiveness. But a growing body of research shows how cyber operations tend to fall short of their promise. The reason for this shortfall is their subversive mechanism of action. In theory, subversion provides a way to exert influence at lower risks than force because it is secret and indirect, exploiting systems to use them against adversaries. The mismatch between promise and practice is the consequence of the subversive trilemma of cyber operations, whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables. A case study of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict provides empirical support for the argument. Qualitative analysis leverages original data from field interviews, leaked documents, forensic evidence, and local media. Findings show that the subversive trilemma limited the strategic utility of all five major disruptive cyber operations in this conflict...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

It was there that the game was shown off in a demo reel, as part of various upcoming GameCube and Nintendo DS titles. Alas, as we now know, this Kirby never made it much further.

Coming from reliable source Deallabs, the PlayStation Plus games for June are reportedly  God of War (2018), Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl. These games will be available from 7th June until 5th July.
Some have seen the inclusion of God of War as a hint that Sony may be looking to up the marketing for its sequel, God of War: Ragnarök. After all, the game is still slated to release some time this year, and that 2022 window is rapidly getting smaller and smaller (I for one can't believe we are nearly in June already!).

For starters, Brotherhood apparently includes a "blink-and-you'll-miss-it" appearance by Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order star Cal Kestis, who was but a youngling at the time of the novel's events.

The removal was spotted over the weekend by Jon Cartwright and appears to be recent (thanks, VG247). SoulCalibur for the OG Xbox has also been delisted, it was noted, although this seems to have happened some time ago. 

SoulCalibur 2 HD now shows a "not available separately" message when attempting to buy the game via the Microsoft Store's website - though it does not appear to be available elsewhere as part of any bundle - and "not available at this time" via Xbox consoles.

 This fan made threequel is set 22 years after the events of Banjo-Tooie and the defeat of Gruntilda. And, for a pretty decent period of time, everything seemed to be calm and collected for our heroes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has said it is unlikely to restore the Xbox's "Snap" ability in a future update.


That's according to Xbox engineering lead Eden Marie, who noted on Twitter that: "While we all miss snap, I don't think it's coming back."


Snap was a key feature - and one of the few selling points - of the Xbox One at its launch. The handy ability let you stick an app to one side of your screen while continuing to play games alongside.

A filing in the Japanese government's official gazette shows sales were up over 70 percent from the previous year to 204bn yen (US$1.6bn), while operating profit was at 59 billion yen (US$460m) and net profit rose 123 percent to 41bn yen (US$320m).




Of course, that's down to some huge game releases over the fiscal year, including Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Pokémon Unite and New Pokémon Snap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the various announcements revealed this weekend as part of Star Wars Celebration, we got news of a Lego BD-1 from Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (arguably the best thing about the game) headed our way.
The new model, which is set to release on 1st August, will have 1062 pieces, and on completion will stand at 31cm. And he won't just be a static companion to add to your collection. Rather, he will have a head that can be "tilted back, forward and sideways for maximum cuteness".
As well as the ability to pose BD-1, those who purchase their own little droid companion this summer will also get to experience other neat little inclusions, such as the back of BD-1's head being translucent to show the droid's mood and a display sign (see below). He probably won't be able to heal you like he does for Cal, however.

The discovery has fans speculating - and hoping - that this may mean that, after a seven year absence, Activision is moving away from battle.net exclusivity on PC and bringing its first-person shooter back to Valve's PC client, Steam.

As spotted by u/Kalinine and posted to Reddit, the Modern Warfare 2 Ghost artwork "show[ed] up on Steam". When pushed for clarification, the user added: "it shows up at the bottom of the DLC page for some Call of duty games like Black Ops 3".

Ramiro Galan - a principal designer at Pixelkings - shared a handful of never-before-seen images on their digital portfolio, showing off what appears to be the cancelled game's character creation screen. 

"Here is a series of styles and screens by Ramiro Galan for a cancelled Marvel MMO title," the album's description tells us. "Emphasis was on rich and vibrant colours with stylistic tones that pay homage to Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse. All design, 3D materials, lighting, and post process FX were done by Ramiro Galan."

Ruby - who hails from Ash vs. Evil Dead - has yet to make an appearance in the main game, and her absence from the roster was a surprising omission to some given the plethora of other characters from Evil Dead stories, both old and new.

Now - thanks to a second batch of datamined voice files from our hero roster - it seems like she will indeed be making an appearance, seemingly batting for the Demons in these particular scenarios, although it's not totally beyond the realm of possibility that she may turn up as a survivor, too - hopefully we'll get an official reveal soon.

The rumour is further compounded by confirmation that Gotham Knight's Russian sub-site has been taken offline; the URL now results in a 404 error (it was still live as at 12th May, according to archive.org). Similarly, the Steam page makes no mention of Russian-language support, hinting that both Russian voicework and subtitles have been removed (thanks, VGC).

"Each of these directors failed either to recognise that Activision Blizzard for years maintained unsafe workplaces exhibiting frequent and repeated sexual harassment, sexual assault, and gender discrimination, or to appropriately address the Company’s 'frat house' culture once it was publicly revealed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) in its pending lawsuit, which was filed in July 2021," the damning letter states.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a flurry of recent leaks, EA has officially unveiled Respawn Entertainment's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sequel. It's called Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and will be out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC some time next year.


While there's little in the way of specifics to accompany today's announcement, EA has confirmed the third-person action-adventure will once again follow the story of Fallen Order protagonist Cal Kestis, albeit five years after the events of the first game.


The teaser trailer released alongside today's announcement doesn't reveal a whole lot more, but we do see Cal, lightsaber in hand and accompanied by trusty robot sidekick BD-1, flexing his action muscles as he remains on the run from the Empire.

Kirby 64 launched as part of Nintendo's Switch Online + Expansion Pack retro collection last week, and players soon began reporting a bug in underwater levels - not seen in the 2000 original - that permanently stunned them after taking damage from certain sources.


In response to those reports, Nintendo has now confirmed a fix is on the way. "A bug has been found in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards for Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online that can prevent players from progressing under a certain condition," it wrote in a tweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over four months after publisher Bandai Namco pulled online PvP support for the Dark Souls series on PC following the discovery of a serious security vulnerability, FromSoftware has said it's "currently in the process of restoring" the games' online servers.


PvP servers for Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 were "temporarily deactivated" back in January after reports the games were vulnerable to Remote Code Execution exploits began to make headlines.


Several weeks later, Bandai Namco offered an update, saying that "due to the time required to set up proper testing environments, online services for the Dark Souls series on PC will not resume until after the release of Elden Ring". But with Elden Ring having been out in the wild for over two months now, the Dark Souls community was steadily to lose its patience as further updates failed to materialised.

Taking its cue from the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion, Frontier's latest blob of DLC for its park management sequel ushers in a star-studded cast, new features, and, of course, new dinosaurs, amounting to what the studio is calling the game's "biggest DLC to date".


First up, there's a new campaign that'll task players with constructing a Research Compound in multiple stages. This features the vocal talents of Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Campbell Scott in their respective big screen roles, and brings a new feature that'll see players unearthing rare genomes in amber mines to create feathered prehistoric species.

Beginning on 1st June and ending on 1st September, the perhaps unimaginatively named Season of Go will be heavily punctuated by the game's key summer event: Go Fest. 


But, happily, there's also more going on - including the recently-confirmed arrival of Pokémon's mysterious extra-dimensional Ultra Beasts. Today, we got our first look at the jellyfish-like Nihilego popping up - appropriately via a wormhole.

The one downside? You can't use Obi-Wan's trusty lightsaber, which instead hangs limply from his trusty Jedi backpack. 


Fortnite has previously featured lightsabers as weapons - and very fun they are too. You can strike, block and perform a neat little combat roll while holding them, and players facing off against each other will often like to go one-on-one with you as a proper duel.

"If you were a monkey, just hangin' out in the jungle with your chimp-chick, and a magic ruby fell out of the sky and zapped you both, turning you into half-humans, and a demon-kid swooped down and made off with your girl - what would you do?"
This is the question Nintendo asked us in the 90s, and now we are in the future we can once again answer. What will we do? Why,we will caper of course! Yes, that's right, Congo's Caper is now available for you to play in the here and now. What a time to be alive.

There was also the briefest of confirmations for a more mysterious Gran Turismo project - and now, Deadline has provided a few more details. 


For starters, Sony's plan for Gran Turismo is to turn it into a film, though work is still "in very early development". Neill Blomkamp, director of District 13, is reportedly being "eyed" to helm the project.

Over 180 million people have played the game since its release in May 2012, with a spike following the Covid-19 outbreak.


Asked how big the uptick in players had been since the pandemic, Vaughan replied: "Interestingly, Plague Inc has always got more popular whenever people get ill, eg When Plague Inc was #1 in Japan - we saw big spikes every time there was a bad flu outbreak. When Ebola was spreading in 2015, we saw a big worldwide spike in players. When Covid first started though we saw the biggest increase in players ever - it lasted for about a month and then went back down to normal levels.

While the device, codenamed Keystone, has never formally been shown, earlier leaks pointed to a mini box similar to a shrunk down Xbox Series S, which acted as a hub for Ethernet, USB and HDMI ports.


Xbox's plan - which still seems to be in place, albeit no longer in the immediate future - is to launch Keystone as a small gadget capable of streaming Xbox Game Pass titles to any monitor or TV screen with no extra console hardware required.

These latest job losses will affect Hangar 13's main location in California, Kotaku reported. Staff were informed remotely by Hangar 13's new boss Nick Baynes, who ran the company's Brighton location before succeeding Blackman as overall company head.

During a recent Q&A, fans asked more about the development of Barbara, aka Batgirl. This was following a backlash to her character's biography on the game's website, which described her as training to "recover from her wounds" so that she could "return to active duty as Batgirl".
In the comic books, Barbara Gordon is shot in the spine by Joker, leading to her using a wheelchair. While she may not have the exact same backstory in Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. previously stated Barbara was in a wheelchair following a "face-off".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since its unveiling in 2020, Dead Space creator Glen Schofield's sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol has conjured images of Dead Space, so it was a bit of a surprise when, due to various studio connections, it was announced the game would be set in the PUBG Universe. That, however, is no longer the case, with Schofield now saying it's its "own story and world".


The Callisto Protocol is a third-person horror game set in 2320, with its action unfolding within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter's moon Callisto. While that set-up mightn't immediately scream PUBG to onlookers, the connection came from the fact developer Striking Distance was explicitly established by PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton to create narrative-driven games that would expand the universe introduced in the battle royale hit.


As Schofield explained in a recent GameInformer cover feature on The Callisto Protocol, "When we came in, [Krafton] had a lore team and they were writing this big story, like, 'Where does PUBG start? Where does it fit in?'". Had those plans continued, the horror game would have sat "pretty far out" along the timeline, but somewhere during development the idea was dropped.

Kubernetes StatefulSets, since their introduction in
1.5 and becoming stable in 1.9, have been widely used to run stateful applications. They provide stable pod identity, persistent
per pod storage and ordered graceful deployment, scaling and rolling updates. You can think of StatefulSet as the atomic building
block for running complex stateful applications. As the use of Kubernetes has grown, so has the number of scenarios requiring
StatefulSets. Many of these scenarios, require faster rolling updates than the currently supported one-pod-at-a-time updates, in the
case where you're using the OrderedReady Pod management policy for a StatefulSet.
Here are some examples:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary actor Ray Liotta, who made a memorable impact on the world of gaming as the voice of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City protagonist Tommy Vercetti in 2002, has died aged 67.


Although Liotta only ever starred in one other game - Call of Duty: Black Ops 2's DLC pack Mob of the Dead in 2013 - the actor had a long, enormously prolific career in both film and television, appearing in wide variety of productions, ranging from beloved baseball movie Field of Dreams to ER, and, more recently, Apple's psychological thriller Black Bird.


Arguably his most iconic role, though, remains his 1990 breakthrough performance in Martin Scorsese's movie classic Goodfellas, where he starred as real-life mobster Henry Hill alongside the likes of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft's long-awaited The Wild Update - which includes two new biomes, new mobs, and various other delights - finally has a release date, and will be launching on 7th June.


The Wild Update's first major addition comes in the form of the new Mangrove Swamp biome, bringing mangrove trees and a new natural (and craftable) resource known as mud blocks. It also ushers in the highly anticipated Deep Dark biome, which was originally due to launch as part of the Caves & Cliffs update before getting delayed.


The Deep Dark biome, as its name very much implies, is Minecraft's deepest area to date, and is found beneath the game's current bedrock layer. Here, curious adventures will uncover remnants of a ruined civilisation as well as creepy, eyeless mobs known as Wardens. These fearsome foes react to vibrations, meaning stealth is the key to survival, and can also be summoned if careless explorers stumble into the new Shrieker traps.

You can pick up the base game and almost all its DLC on PC for around £16 in the latest Humble charity bundle.


Cities: Skylines was a solidly entertaining city builder when it released all the way back in 2015, but seven years of expansions and other post-launch DLC haved created a game of truly amazing scope. However, getting your hands on absolutely everything that's released thus far is, inevitably, an extremely pricey undertaking even during sale season.


Hop over to the Humble Store right now though, and you can pick up publisher Paradox Interactive's Cities: Skylines Colossal Collection. This features a total of 32 items (usually costing £204.39), including the base game, plus its After Dark, Snowfall, Natural Disasters, Mass Transit, Green Cities, Parklife, Industries, Campus, and Sunset Harbour expansions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its latest earnings report, CD Projekt has offered an revised breakdown of the projects currently occupying the studio's time, confirming the "bulk of" its development capacity is now focused on Cyberpunk 2077's story expansion, which is still expected to launch next year.


Following Cyberpunk's disastrous release at the tail-end of 2020, the majority of CD Projekt's development resources (as shown in the chart below) were focused on remedying the game's most pressing issues. At the same time, a smaller team was working on its next-gen release, promised long before the project's launch woes, and an even smaller group was doing preliminary work on its paid expansion.


Inevitably, those numbers have shifted considerably over time - less than half of CD Projekt's development staff were working on Cyberpunk's base game and next-gen update by June last year, for instance - and that trend has, unsurprisingly, continued. As per today's financial results, Cyberpunk 2077 support has "shrunk considerably" following the release of its next-gen update (which CD Projekt says had "a positive effect on the game's perception and sales figures"), with the "bulk of [the studio's] development capacity" now working on its expansion.

During a Q&A on the Gotham Knights Discord, creative director Patrick Redding revealed Nightwing's Flying Trapeze was inspired by "a couple of ideas" including some classic issues in the Nightwing solo book that saw the DC hero using his "aerialist moves with jet-powered gliders".
Additionally, the team wanted it to feel as though Nightwing had been through the late, great, Batman's arsenal.

"Our first step when designing the map was to decide where the bosses would appear, especially the important ones," said Miyazaki. "Therefore, the map was really designed on the basis of boss gameplay, then we adjusted the boss gameplay based on their location on the map."

"You don't see it in the executive ranks, you don't see it in the leadership ranks of key developers. It's incredibly difficult to find it in various games," he points out.

Twitch streamer BushyGames has released a YouTube video explaining his build and methodology - and, of course, including the boss battles themselves.


For the challenge, he gave himself free reign on strategies, abilities, and weapons, but only one attack per enemy or per boss phase (for those with multiple phases) was allowed. The (arguably overpowered) sorcery Comet Azur was also not allowed.

EA, as with the majority of companies, has not. Nor has it publicly made a specific statement on legal issues threatening transgender rights, which are ongoing in several states. Now, speaking via a town hall meeting leaked to Kotaku, its chief people officer Mala Singh was asked why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has called out Microsoft executives (both former and current) for their poor behaviour towards staff, including instances of verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 
Insider (via Windows Central) reported that Microsoft's Alex Kipman, Terry Myerson and Tom Keane have all been accused of creating a toxic workplace environment during their time with the company.
Most notably, and incredibly disturbingly, Kipman (who currently oversees Microsoft's metaverse efforts) is reported to have watched inappropriate footage via a VR headset, which was then projected onto an external screen, while in room full of his colleagues.

In a new presentation to investors, Sony also said it had a God of War TV show in development for Amazon, and a further Gran Turismo pitch it was also working on.

There's no word on plot details for Horizon - or any of the above projects - or word on when we might see them materialise. Still, hopefully someone at Sony is talking to Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie right now and asking about her availability.

Numerous users reported via social media that they had been told they would have to pay up for any difference in pricing - achieved via stacking or from redeeming discounted PlayStation Plus offers - for the full term of their remaining subscription balance. It was a situation that left some with eye-opening charges to suddenly cough up.


Now, following general confusion and a good deal of online backlash, Sony has finally acknowledged the situation and termed it as a "technical error" which "has been fixed".

In a financial presentation last night, Sony exec Jim Ryan noted that, despite a strong launch, PS5 sales were lagging behind PS4 in its equivalent second year owing to supply constraints.


Those supply constraints are due to both the Covid pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine, but remain a top priority for Sony.

It's Le Mans month! And what better way to whet your appetite than by taking to the wheel of the winner of last year's race, Toyota's GR010 hypercar which today makes its video game debut in Gran Turismo 7 thanks to its latest update. 


Oh, there are some other cars too - namely a new GT Vision Suzuki and an outrageous beefed up Camaro going under the Roadster Shop Rampage name. They come alongside some new Scapes in New Orleans to snap your cars - and once you're done admiring the new cars you can take part in the Gran Turismo World Series which is kicking off in Gran Turismo 7 this weekend, with the preliminary rounds open to all-comers taking place on 27th May and 28th May. 


The World Series grand finale will be returning to a real life event in Monte Carlo this November - a fitting backdrop for what's become one of the glitziest online racing competitions in recent years, and one that's delivered some decent action too.

The original For The King, if you're unfamiliar, was a thoroughly entertaining (if sometimes brutally challenging) blend of familiar RPG stables - think dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - streamlined into a light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure.


More than anything, it was a wonderfully designed little story generator - encompassing everything from haunted carnivals to suffocating jungles - with enough potential combinations across its moving parts to feel sufficiently different each run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator's free Top Gun: Maverick expansion has remained something of a mystery since its announcement last June, but now, with the update finally here on Xbox and PC, developer Asobo has detailed exactly what to expect when it's fired up for the first time.


One notable oddity of the Top Gun expansion is that it'll be launching without what's arguably its biggest feature: the F/A-18E Super Hornet. However, that's only because Asobo made the decision to release the plane early as part of last year's free Game of the Year Edition update when the expansion was delayed alongside the Top Gun: Maverick movie.


Even without the plane as its flagship addition, though, there's still plenty for simmers to grapple with, starting with three training missions for the F/A-18E, all designed to help pilots master "radical flight maneuvers including unrestricted take-offs, split S maneuvers, and low altitude, high-speed maneuvering through complex terrain."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Northgard developer Shiro Games' sci-fi strategy title Dune: Spice Wars generated plenty of praise when it launched into Steam early access toward the end of last month, and now, as the studio starts to build on that initial success, publisher Funcom has shared an initial development roadmap promising the likes of multiplayer, spaceports, and more to come.


First up in terms of major new features is multiplayer, currently scheduled to arrive some time this "summer". Details are scarce at this juncture, but Funcom's roadmap makes reference to both co-op play and "free-for-all" PvP, with up to four players supported at one time.


Also due this summer is a brand-new faction, but specifics are even more limited in this case. All we're getting for the time being is the tease of a suitably mysterious silhouette and a note that the faction will include a "new victory condition".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barely a month has gone by since the arrival of No Man's Sky's major Outlaws update, which gave intergalactic explorers the opportunity to live out their pirate fantasies, but already Hello Games is back - this time with a brand-new expedition that finally answers fan pleas to add space whales (of a sort) to the exploratory sim.
Expeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are effectively No Man's Sky's stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle its various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. And today's addition, titled Leviathan, is a very different proposition to April's The Blighted, and sounds considerably more ambitious - and significantly weirder - than any of the expeditions we've seen before. 
That said, Leviathan begins in much the same way as previous expeditions, dropping all players into one location. However, what follows is something closer to a roguelike experience, stripping explorers of their progress whenever they die. The narrative twist, though, is that players are actually stuck in a mysterious time loop, and the entire community will need to work together to find a way to break free.

Inspired by classic slasher films of the 1980s, it's a narrative-driven game that sees you escaping a house by solving puzzles, making dialogue decisions, and avoiding the killer.


That's an impossible feat at first, but repeated attempts at escape will put all the pieces together. And judging by the trailer below, its low-fi graphics only add to the horrifying atmosphere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher School live-action role-play events in Poland, one of which I attended in 2016, have come to an end because of a contractual termination by CD Projekt Red over use of The Witcher name. The exact reasons why are potentially political but also unclear.
5 Żywiołów (5 Elements), the company behind the events, alleges that CD Projekt Red pulled the licence because of a staff member's involvement with the ultra-conservative Polish Catholic organisation Ordo Iuris, which is anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+, and rejects the idea of gender equality.
The staff member in question, Ania Wawrzyniak, is the wife of 5 Żywiołów founder Dastin Wawrzyniak. And according to a Facebook post co-signed by brothers Dastin and Dominic Wawrzyniak, Ania worked as a lawyer for the company for around two years (between 2017 and 2019, they later specified).

The Structured Logging Working

Structured logging
The goal of structured
logging
is to replace C-style formatting and the resulting opaque log strings with log
entries that have a well-defined syntax for storing message and parameters
separately, for example as a JSON struct.
When using the traditional klog text output format for structured log calls,
strings were originally printed with \n escape sequences, except when
embedded inside a struct. For structs, log entries could still span multiple

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Temtem, developer Crema's massively multiplayer riff on Pokémon, will be leaving early access and getting its full PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 6th September.


Temtem, you might recall, entered Steam early access back in January 2020, selling over half a million copies in its first month of release. Crema has been steadily expanded the game's core creature-collecting and battling action since then - introducing the likes of new Temtem, new islands to explore, and new social and competitive features, not to mention launching an early access version for PS5 - and update 1.0 is now finally in sight.


After more than two years in early access, Temtem is already pretty feature rich, with its pre-release version including the bulk of its story campaign across the Airborne Archipelago, well over 100 Temtem to catch, co-op play, competitive multiplayer, clans, housing, trading, and tournaments. However, its final release promises a number of new additions.

Developer Maxis confirmed it was investigating ways to introduce expanded pronoun options to The Sims 4 last May - following a community petition signed by more than 22,000 people - and players got a first look at the feature's progress during a livestream earlier this year.


And now, with some additional development time under its belt, Maxis has pushed the first iteration of its customisable pronouns feature - developed in conjunction with LGBTQ+ nonprofit organisations It Gets Better and GLAAD - live, delivering what it calls a further step "in the direction of a more inclusive experience for Simmers".

Platforms have yet to be detailed.


Activision Blizzard formally revealed Modern Warfare 2 and its logo in April - after months of rumours and even an official pre-announcement announcement in February.


Following today's release date confirmation, specifics remain extremely light, but the gameplay-free trailer accompanying Activision Blizzard's announcement does include a description revealing a smidgeon more of what's in store.

DICE at least does have some previous in turning around a shaky ship - Battlefield 4 went from a disastrous launch to become one of the most celebrated in the series - and is making the right noises ahead of the belated launch of Battlefield 2042's first season next month. 


While we're not yet privy to the full reveal, a discussion between creative director Lars Gustavsson, senior producer Ryan McArthur and community manager Freeman outlined the studio's commitment to Battlefield 2042 - interesting itself in light of comments made by EA boss Andrew Wilson to investors earlier this month that suggested development on the series is being rethought - as well as what changes to expect.

It's a handy feature which was also added post-launch to Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Valhalla's predecessor, and no doubt will also encourage a few people to go splash out further on some of this game's flashier cosmetic armour sets. Here's how it looks:

One such find has recently surfaced, and it involves the final memory Link uncovers towards the game's close.
Those who have played through Breath of the Wild will know that Link slowly starts to regain his memories of the events before and during the Great Calamity as the game progresses (of course, this being Breath of the Wild, you could also blast through without collecting a single one of these memories if facing off against Ganon with the bare essentials is more your thing). 
The final memory can only be discovered when players have collected the 12 others scattered across Hyrule and cannot be happened upon by accident (which incidentally is how I found most of them - my geographical recognition was pretty poor during my first playthrough).

That's been put down by some to the recent popularity of the Jetstream Sam meme, spotted by IGN.

"After losing his precious ring to Bilbo Baggins, Gollum decides to leave the Misty Mountains and embark on a perilous journey that leads him from the dungeons of Barad-dûr to the realm of the Wood-elves in Mirkwood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go has teased the imminent arrival of Ultra Beasts - the powerful cluster of creatures that invaded Pokémon Sun and Moon via extra-terrestrial wormholes from another dimension. 


The below teaser shows Nihilego, a Rock/Poison-type which looks like a big space jellyfish. It's actually one of the more normal-looking Ultra Beasts, which were specifically designed to appear alien in the traditional Pokémon world.


We also get a glimpse of a figure dressed in the uniform of the Ultra Recon Squad. Will these be new PVE enemies in the game's overworld? Or is this just a snazzy outfit for your avatar to wear? Here's a look:

Take-Two is the company behind some of video gaming's biggest names, such as Borderlands and Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, BioShock and Mafia.

Publisher Square Enix had originally planned each season to last three months, but now that's been doubled. "Based on the feedback we have received from our players, we feel that we need a period to re-evaluate the game's future operating roadmap", according to a blog post from last Friday.


"Season 2 will include the Ver. 1.2.1 small-scale update, but after that we will be using the extra three months of the season extension for development on the next update, and so will not be making any further updates or adding new content during that time.

Now, the duo are returning to the series in the aptly named Return to Monkey Island and in the run up to its release have revealed the one puzzle they regret from their original time working on the series. 
Chatting to GamesBeat, Gilbert and Grossman revealed the Monkey Wrench puzzle from LeChuck's Revenge, which saw Guybrush Threepwood using an actual monkey to activate a seemingly broken pump, was a mistake, calling it "notoriously unsolvable" and "not a good design on several levels". 
"Even if you are an English speaker from a location where the tool in question is commonly called a 'monkey wrench,' and you realise that that's what you need, you still have to make an astonishing predictive leap about how your actions will create that tool," said Grossman. "Nothing in the game sets any of it up adequately."

Blaidd, for the unaware, is an NPC in FromSoftware's epic who's half man and half wolf. He's involved in one of the game's main quests, helps players with one of the major bosses, and has had the furry community in a frenzy.


Welsh voice actor Arthur admits it too. "I know that he's caused quite a stir in the furry world, which I didn't know anything about until I looked on the internet," he says at the start.

The launch gives us our first proper look at the service's full catalogue of games - although fans say it contains far fewer titles in its catalogue than previously expected. 


Indeed, a guide to PlayStation Plus published yesterday on the PlayStation blog mentions "700" games available across the subscription's various plans - a rough figure we've heard from Sony before - albeit with the caveat that these games will vary "over time and plan".

The subscription has now launched in Asia, but - as spotted by VGC - some PS1 games are using the PAL (Europe, Australia, New Zealand) version instead of the NTSC (Asia, America).


That means they're presented in 50Hz instead of 60Hz, resulting in a lower refresh rate and therefore lower framerates.

Activision Blizzard contested the filing, but its arguments were rejected by NLRB, whereupon the publisher was reportedly began ramping up its anti-unionisation efforts.

When Sony Bend Studio shared word of Syphon Filter's new trophies last week, it didn't confirm whether other PS1 titles would be getting a similar treatment as part of Sony's revised PlayStation Plus - but with the service now going live, that question has been answered.


Achievement tracking website Exophase has revealed trophy lists for four more PS1 games alongside the previously announced Syphon Filter: I.Q. Intelligent Qube, Hot Shots Golf, Ape Escape, and Wild Arms (which, notably, wasn't on Sony's previous list of PS Plus inclusions).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asmodee Digital's video game adaptation of acclaimed co-op board game Gloomhaven is, after more than two years on Steam, finally coming to consoles.

Although Flaming Fowl Studios developed the PC version - which came out of early access at the end of last year - Saber Interactive will seemingly be handling the console port. 

"We're excited to bring Gloomhaven to new players around the world with Saber Interactive," Asmodee Digital CEO Pierre Ortolan confirmed to press. "Partnerships like this are one of the great advantages we have available to us now as part of Embracer Group, and we look forward to tapping into even more opportunities to deliver for our fans in the future."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A surprise ESRB listing for Square Enix's newly announced The DioField Chronicle has revealed some additional details about the mysterious game. 

The DioField Chronicle is a new tactics game coming to PS4 and PS5 later this year, as well as PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It was announced at PlayStation State of Play back in March.

Beyond that, we haven't really heard all that much about it, so it was a pleasant surprise to see the tactics game pop up on the ESRB website (thanks, Gematsu), not least because it included a summary of the game, as well as details as to why the board classified it as a "Teen" game due to its blood, "mild suggestive themes", and violence.

In an interview with NetEase Games (via Niche Gamer), Suda hinted that the team is making "truly cool and all-new games" that may be announced "around the end of the year".
