        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eve Online subscriptions are going up, including the one-month charge, which is being increased for the first time since 2004.
In a blog post justifying the changes (thanks, PCGN), CCP says the uplift "reflects global trends impacting general productions costs and accounts for years of inflation" and have been introduced in order to "continue investing in Eve Online’s evolution and growth".

"Since Eve Online’s original launch back in 2003, together EVE’s developers and community have led the charge in evolving what sandbox MMOs can be," the post explains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An update to Call of Duty developer Infinity Ward's Twitter page has fans speculating that the team may be ready to announced a new Modern Warfare game.

On Friday, Infinity Ward switched out both its Twitter banner and profile icon which - at first blush, anyway - seemed to be solid black logos with no image or text. 

Brightened up, however, and eagle-eyed players think they've spotted fan-favourite character Ghost lurking in the background, sparking whispers that an announcement is imminent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following GOG's example, CD Projekt is reportedly considering introducing paid menstrual leave for its employees.
In recognition of the impact period pain has on some staff, at the time of the announcement GOG said the "experimental" leave "breaks taboos" and is "yet another step towards making GOG an even more inclusive workplace", but it won’t stop its "continuous efforts to learn, reflect and improve on how we can do better for all of our team members".

Given the initiative was announced at the start of April not everyone was convinced of the sincerity of the announcement, but Axios confirms the scheme was introduced following the personal experiences from inside GOG's own team.

"Straight from the highly acclaimed horror game Silent Hill 2 comes a high-quality statue of the iconic Bubble Head Nurse, a sinister female monster manifested from James Sunderland’s subconscious," the blurb explains.

The co-op campaign was expected to release next month after it was delayed from the initial launch. However, last month developer 343 Industries acknowledged that it needed "more time" to work on the cooperative campaign and Forge, and cooperative missions would not be available in May as hoped.

Now, in an image on the company's latest news update, 343i has revealed the "target" for campaign co-op is August, along with campaign mission replay. The Forge Open Beta is slated for September, but split-screen isn't expected until sometime during November's Season 3.

"There are no good guys, no bad guys, with only nature as the adversary," a press statement teases. "A sandstorm will appear randomly in wild areas of battle royale. Players entering the sandstorm will be challenged to avoid hurricanes and tornadoes to reach the high-tier loot and special items contained within the weather event."

Dropping on 28th April at 1am UK time, season 4 also offers two new maps - Cold War's Satellite and Modern Warfare 2019's Khandor Hideout - as well as new operators, weapons, blueprints, calling cards, charms, and COD Points, plus 50 new tiers of "Battle Pass rewards".

<p>&#8220;The metal islands in our composite material are next to one another when the material is relaxed and become separated when the material is stretched, allowing for control of the reflection and transmission of infrared light or heat dissipation,&#8221; said Gorodetsky. &#8220;The mechanism is analogous to chromatophore expansion and contraction in a squid&#8217;s skin, which alters the reflection and transmission of visible light.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

As reported by Promobricks (via VGC), an official Lego version of the Atari 2600 console - which initially released as the Atari VCS all the way back in 1977 - complete with distinctive wooden trim, will arrive this August as part of Atari's 50th anniversary celebrations.


Promobricks says the set - not to to be confused with the fan-made submission on Lego's Ideas website - will include a Lego rendition of the console itself (said to be roughly the size of the 1977 original), a replica of the equally iconic CX40 joystick, plus a cartridge of gaming classic Pitfall! fashioned from plastic bricks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch's Joy-Con controllers have become notorious for their struggles with "drift", to the point that lawsuits have been launched over the issue, the EU has pledged to investigate, and Nintendo's president has even formally apologised. A new report, though, shines additional light on the extent of the issue, claiming that Nintendo's US arm was receiving "easily thousands" of faulty controllers a week for repair at the height of the problem.


That's according to a new report by Kotaku, which, citing a former supervisor at the Switch repair facility (run by United Radio under contract with Nintendo), claims the volume of repairs got so high - with "hundreds" of faulty controllers arriving each day - that work became "very stressful", leading to high turnover in the department and "lots of" repair mistakes.


Nintendo's initial response to the Joy-Con drift problem, reportedly saw the company providing replacements for customers' faulty Joy-Cons between 2017 and 2018; however, that policy is said to have eventually changed and repair staff were then required to repair every set of Joy-Cons received. At the height of Switch's Joy-Con drift issues, Nintendo's repair centre was reportedly receiving “easily thousands" of faulty units each week, necessitating the establishment of new workplace specifically for controller repairs.

And now it's delivered, giving the overhauled subscription service a launch target of 22nd June in Europe and 13th June in the US.


That's according to an update on Sony's official PlayStation Blog which, alongside the target dates mentioned above, also reveals a planned 1st June launch for the new PlayStation Plus in Japan and an even earlier 23rd May arrival in all other Asian markets.


Sony's overhauled PlayStation Plus combines elements of its existing PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now subscription services into one, offering three distinct subscription tiers - Essential, Extra, and Premium - each with their own distinct features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2 might have had a rocky road to release, but it looks like the project has paid off for developer Techland; the studio has revealed its zombie parkour sequel has surpassed 5m copies sold across all platforms since its launch at the start of February, with that number reflective of sales as of 28th February and said to be "significantly growing" each month.


By way of comparison, we can look toward Dying Light's original instalment, also regarded as a sizeable hit for the studio. That game - according to new figures released by Techland today - has now sold 20m copies since launching a little over seven years ago in 2015, meaning its follow-up really is off to a flying start.


All that suggests a healthy future for Dying Light 2 - doubtlessly reassuring for Techland, given the developer has already committed to five years of post-launch DLC support for the game. Already that promise has brought the likes of new armour, weapons, events, and challenges to the game, with the first bit of substantial post-launch story content scheduled to arrive this June.

A new trailer today has showcased its 4v4 online Turf War battle mode across "a mix of new and familiar stages". Fresh off the boat here is Eeltail Alley, a new level, and the stringer, a bow-shaped weapon type you can fire ink from both vertically and horizontally.


In single-player mode, meanwhile, you'll fight the Octarians and "discover the secrets of Alterna and the Fuzzy Ooze". I have no doubt Splatoon master and Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson is excited by the sounds of that.

<p>ECDSA signatures rely on a pseudo-random number, typically notated as K, that’s used to derive two additional numbers, R and S.

A bonus listed simply as "Letterbox Background" is highlighted as being available in either the Premium Fun Pack DLC or the separate Start Dash Pack DLC - free but only if you pre-order.

Both games, if you're unfamiliar, play out as side-scrolling platformers in which protatongist Klonoa, a Dream Traveler (and be-hatted rabbit thing), embarks on an adventure to save their respective worlds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been an eventful day for long-starved Skate fans; not only did footage from the series' upcoming fourth instalment leak its way onto the internet, additional details have begun to emerge, with a new report suggesting Skate 4 will let players build skateparks together in free skate mode as part of an emphasis on user-generated content.


That's according to the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb, who shared some fresh Skate 4 morsals from his sources during the most recent episode of his Giant Bomb show Grubbsnax. As transcribed by VGC, Grubb began by saying early word on the game appeared to be positive, with those who've played it being "very impressed with the way it feels."


According to Grubb, EA's goal with Skate 4 is to modernise the series while retaining its much-loved skating core, with some of the new features said to be akin to those seen in the likes of Forza or other modern multiplayer games. These reportedly includes ample customisation options for characters - "a lot of skins, skins for your board, things like that", Grubb explained - as well as user-generated content, which Skate 4 will "really emphasise".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sci-fi grand strategy game Stellaris' new Overlord expansion has been given a release date and will be making its way to PC on 12th May, arriving alongside a free update for all players.


Overlord is Stellaris' sixth major expansion (following on from Nemesis, Federations, MegaCorp, Apocalypse, and Utopia), and brings a range of new options for players as they spread their influence among the stars, this time loosely focussed on empire management.


There are, for instance, new vassalisation mechanics, enabling players to negotiate or demand the terms of their agreements with their new vassals, or even define the specialist role they'll play in an empire - either focusing on military might, tech research, or economic acquisition.

Developed by Forever Entertainment and MegaPixel Studio, which previously collaborated on the similar Panzer Dragoon remake, this updated version of Sega's beloved 1997 arcade rail-shooter, delivers all the ludicrous zombie blasting action (and wonderfully awful dialogue) of the original, albeit with a fresh lick of modern-day paint.


Alongside its enhanced visuals, which you can scrutinise for yourself in the trailer below, House of the Dead: Remake also features a new Horde mode that increases the on-screen enemy count, updated controls (what with modern hardware largely being upsettingly lightgun-free), two-player local co-op, a photo mode, gallery, leaderboards, and achievements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we're talking about Microsoft and Sony's plans to put advertising in free-to-play games. It's a feature commonly found - and widely accepted, if not enjoyed - in free mobile titles, which now seems to be on the way to your PlayStation and Xbox.
It's fair to say that few people enjoy advertising and it's unlikely you'd opt into seeing more of it - but do Microsoft and Sony see this as a way to encourage new, smaller developers into the console space? Of course, a lot depends on how these plans are implemented - and here we chew over a few ways that could be worse than others.
Finally, to lighten the mood, we have a chat about Amy Hennig's return to the Star Wars universe and the sheer number of upcoming games set in the galaxy far, far away we now have to look forward to. Apex Legends developer is making three, alongside projects from Quantic Dream, Ubisoft and others. Joining me to discuss all that are Eurogamer reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan!

To put it into context, Dre hadn't published any new music since his last album, Compton, back in 2015. 


So just how did Rockstar convince one of the greatest rappers in history to play such a large role in a video game?

F1 22, as it's monikered, will of course feature all the tracks and new cars of the new season, alongside tweaked physics to take into account the ground-effect enabled cornering speeds of the new breed. It'll also offer the debut of the new Miami circuit, as well as a refined race day experience that offers both 'Immersive' and 'Broadcast' modes, with the former putting an emphasis on you making the big decisions while the latter allows for a more relaxed experience. 


Perhaps most significantly for long-running players of the series VR support will finally be available on PC for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift players.

Fortnite has played host to countless Marvel characters before, of course, typically timed around their appearances on the big screen or TV shows (the current battle pass includes Doctor Strange, while we were treated to Hawkeye and Kate Bishop late last year). 


Moon Knight's rather fetching skin includes a style with/without his cloak, and an additional style for his Mr. Knight persona. (We won't get into story details here, in case you're yet to start the new series.)

"After careful deliberations, the developers of TERA have unfortunately taken the difficult decision to end development of the game, as they feel that they are no longer able to provide the satisfying content that TERA players deserve. Instead, they would like to focus their internal development efforts on other projects," publisher Gameforge wrote in a statement. 
"Gameforge has happily hosted a great community in TERA for almost 10 years now, and would have happily served players even longer, but without the support of the developers this is not feasible."

Core to the DLC - which aims to give players the opportunity to "truly decide the fate of the [Iberian] peninsula, either by reenacting history or creating an alternative that pleases you more" - is a new system that Paradox is referring to as the Struggle, said to highlight the "unique historical circumstances that typify regions that have been centres of conflict" and "create new opportunities and add constraints" for players in the Iberian peninsula.


Fate of Iberia will include an updated map for the region - refining the county and duchy divisions, as well as cultures and faiths - alongside new events (some specific to Iberia and others adding variety for all players), new Urbane and Coterie Legacy tracks, new Cultural Traditions, plus new friend interactions and duels.

As reported by Business Insider (paywall), which cites three people involved with Sony plans as its sources, the company is currently investigating ways to encourage developers to continue making free-to-play games - said to have soared in popularity during the pandemic - by providing new ways to monetise them.


At present, PlayStation's ad inventory is said to be limited to in-menu ads - which can be used by publishers and developers to do things like promote their own games on the PlayStation Store - and ads served via streaming video on certain apps.

Ghostbusters VR

Ghostbusters VR (working title, if you were wondering) brings the 80s movie classic to virtual reality as a four-player co-op adventure promising an "extensive and engrossing" spirit-bothering campaign. Players will need to track, blast, and trap ghosts as they protect San Francisco from the unearthly realm, with developer nDreams aiming to deliver "all the humour and frights from the beloved franchise" when Ghostbusters VR eventually arrives at some currently undisclosed future point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil 4's Mercenaries mode arrives today as part of the Meta Quest 2 version of Capcom's classic, via a free update with brand new content made specifically for this VR version. The announcement came via the just-finished Meta Gaming Showcase event - and you can play the mode for yourself now, or watch our Ian try it for himself just below.

Mercenaries, a wave-based PVE mode found in several Resident Evil titles, is a fan-favourite - and not least in Resident Evil 4, where you face hordes of ganados against the clock while attempting to land a high score. But this fresh version of Mercenaries for Meta Quest 2 includes an array of new options and unlockable extras - including online leaderboards and 20 Challenges which mix up Mercenaries' gameplay in new ways.
Challenges include options which restrict gameplay to just knives or rocket launchers, or shroud the map in fog. Complete these, and you'll gain access to other all-new additions such as a Big Head Mode, speedy Fast Forward mode, and a black-and-white Classic Horror Mode for the main Resi 4 campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ludeon Studios' widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim RimWorld has had its Refused Classification status rescinded in Australia following a successful appeal, meaning its effective ban in the region has been overturned.
The notoriously sensitive Australian Classification Board initially refused to grant RimWorld a rating in March after its publisher Double Eleven Limited submitted the game for an upcoming "multi platform" launch, prohibiting it from release and effectively banning it from sale. The decision even affected the long-available Steam version of RimWorld, preventing new purchases from being made on Valve's digital store.
No specific reason was given for the board's decision at the time, with its website only referencing its usual boilerplate copy for games refused a rating, saying RC titles are those that "depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified."

If you prefer to use Sony's DualSense controller during your PC sessions, but a lack of PS5 console is holding you back from purchasing one, we have great news - you now no longer need to own a PlayStation 5 to update a DualSense controller. Huzzah!
"PC players can now update their DualSense wireless controller with the latest firmware from Windows 11 and select Windows 10 devices, without connecting to a PS5," Sony announced today. 
In order to do this, you will need to download the Firmware updater for DualSense wireless controller app (catchy name) to your Windows PC. When this app is loaded, all you will then need to do to get all the latest updates on your controller is use a USB cable to connect said controller to your PC, and then just follow the on-screen instructions and you're away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego Builder's Journey, the gorgeous diorama puzzler from developer Light Brick Studio, has made the leap from iOS to console, and is now available to purchase on PS4 and PS5.
Lego Builder's Journey, which originally launched as an Apple Arcade release toward the end of 2019, is, conceptually, a fairly simple thing, tasking players with building a path across a selection of beautifully presented Lego dioramas so their little Lego pal can push onward.
Eurogamer's Christian Donlan was quite taken with Lego Builder's Journey's breezy, tactile charms at the time, and spoke highly of its "meditative, contemplative tapping and twisting and reworking and rethinking" in his write up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been nearly five months since the troubled Marvel's Avengers last received a new playable character - the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man - but there's finally good news for those wondering when the drought might end: developer Crystal Dynamics has confirmed another superhero is on the way, this time in the form of Jane Foster, the Mighty Thor.


Details on Foster's video game iteration are limited at this early juncture in Crystal Dynamics' reveal, but the developer has confirmed the character will have "a lot in common" with the version of Thor already in-game. Don't expect a carbon copy, however; "elements that are distinctly Jane" are also promised for her eventual arrival.


Exactly when that might be, though, is unclear. Crystal Dynamic offered no timeline for the new playable character in its recent blog post, only confirming Foster will release as part of Marvel's Avengers' 2.5 update and that more details will be shared "in the future".

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate &#8220;backdoor key&#8221;, the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees. ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

More specifically, Coiled Captors sends players on an adventure deep inside an icy mountain - where they'll find "wintery wastelands, arid ruins, and flooding caverns" - and it's here they'll be tasked with freeing an old god from within the body of a mighty shark-like seawarg, via the time-honoured Borderlands tradition of killing it to death.


Gearbox describes Coiled Captors - which can be accessed via Vesper's first Mirror of Mystery - as a "repayable dungeon challenge", explaining that as well as dealing with fierce resistance from the snake-like members of the Coiled, a secretive sect that worships ancient gods, players will need to tackle the four powerful forms of the DLC's captive old god, Chums.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has detailed World of Warcraft's next expansion, Dragonflight, which will be taking adventurers on a journey to the long-lost Dragon Isles, and introducing a new playable race-class hybrid and flyable dragons along the way. Additionally, the developer has confirmed 2008's Wrath of the Lich King expansion will come to World of Warcraft Classic later this year.


First, Dragonflight, which grants access to the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind, the Dragon Isles, recently reawakened following a period of calamity for Azeroth. This new region - described as lush and primal, bursting with elemental energy - will incorporate everything from icy wastes and magma areas to lush forests and vibrant coasts across its four standard areas (bringing the likes of new dungeons and raids) and new starting zone. 


The Dragon Isles starting area is home to the Dracthyr Evokers, a new playable race-class hybrid that will begin their WoW journey at level 58 and can align with either the Horde or the Alliance. Evokers will have two customisable forms - their draconic avatars used in battle, plus humanoid forms deployed when interacting with Azeroth's inhabitants - and, depending on players' chosen class specialisations, can either focus on damage dealing or healing.

North was a guest on Couch Soup this weekend, as hosts Liam McIntyre and Todd Lasance began their playthrough of Uncharted 4. Just before the opening sequences began rolling, North was asked more about how this final version of the game came about. Clearly not wanting to shy away from the elephant in the room, North went straight into chatting about Hennig, and the changes made after she left the game's development.
"The biggest thing most people probably remember is... we had shot Uncharted 4 with Amy Hennig for about seven months. We were well into the game. And she was dismissed from Naughty Dog... and they got rid of everything we did," North recalled.

The project is the second major game in the works at Skydance New Media, Hennig's new studio, which is also working on an unannounced action-adventure game based around a Marvel property.

Unfortunately, Wolpaw acknowledged the business considerations of Valve focusing a chunk of its workforce on a Portal 3 - especially when the company had the money-printing Steam and hugely successful Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to run instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years (and years) of silence that led many to assume the Monkey Island brand had fallen by the wayside, original creator Ron Gilbert announced a return to its tropical isles earlier this month in the aptly named Return to Monkey Island. Now, Gilbert has also revealed his new game in the series will start off where Monkey Island: LeChuck's Revenge finished – at an amusement park.
"One of the things that was very important to me about this was that I did want the game to start right at the end of Monkey Island 2, when you walk into that amusement park. I wanted the game to start there," Gilbert told Adventure Gamers.
"That was kind of my one criteria: we need to start the game there. I don't want to go into all the details of it, but we do start there, and then it takes lots of weird twists and turns that you would expect from us."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring players are getting soft banned for picking up pants dropped by other players.

As previously reported, players discovered a cut pair of underwear in the game. The Deathbed Smalls were meant to be part of the NPC Fia's armour set, but are unobtainable without hacking the game.


But hacks and mods cannot be used without by-passing the game's anti-cheat system. And simply owning the pants - even if obtained by another player - is seemingly enough to trigger a soft ban.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason Momoa, known for his hulking and somewhat imposing roles in Game of Thrones, Dune and Justice League, is on the cusp of landing his newest role. But this time, it seems the muscular lead will be taking on a much blockier persona than we are used to seeing, as The Hollywood Reporter has reported Momoa is currently in "final talks" for Warner Bros.' live-action Minecraft adaptation.
While his part is not set in stone (cuboid or otherwise), it certainly looks hopeful. So, will he be Steve, or a whole new hero? Or even, the villain? I guess we will have to wait and see.
Along with some potential Mamoa-ness, Variety has additionally revealed the upcoming Minecraft film has also landed Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess as its director. Meanwhile, Dune producer Mary Parent will produce the film, alongside Roy Lee.

In a post on the game's official website, Yoshida outlined what the team was doing to address the problem in which players are being told their bids were unsuccessful because there "were no participants in this lottery", or that the winning number is "0"... even though no players can be assigned that number.

"We understand that this is a major issue, and are prioritising our investigation into the matter," Yoshida said. "We are working to identify the issue in the corresponding program; however, as the process is very complex and there are many patterns involved for the lottery conditions, it will require some time to pinpoint the problem.

As spotted by TechRadar, according to SteamCharts - a site that, predictably enough, charts the performance of games on Steam - the global concurrent player count for the new game dropped to just eight players on Wednesday 13th April. Its highest ever peak sits at just 1166 players. 

In the last 30 days, the average player count has been just 137 simultaneous people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard is seemingly gauging players' interest in cryptocurrency and NFT products.

In a YouGov survey issued to players over the weekend, Activision Blizzard - which is in the process of being acquired by Microsoft - asked players how "interested" they were in a range of "emerging/future trends in gaming".
Amongst standard innovations in the gaming industry, such as VR and AR, AI, cross play, and game subscription services, the company also sought players' views on more controversial topics such as "metaverse gaming experiences, play-to-earn gaming (earn cryptocurrency, NFTs, or real currency) [and] NFTS (non-fungible tokens)" (thanks, GameRant).

According to McDonald, if you visited Stormhill Shack - which had previously been known as Scavenger's Shack and is today the location where you'll meet Roderika - during the network test, it was empty. Before that test, however, it looks like it was the home to an unknown NPC called Monk Jigo.

As spotted by PC Gamer, Jigo had been "seduced by the good lady alcohol" and needed your help to gather the ingredients for Dreambrew, a magical booze that, shared with other NPCs, would unlock bonus dialogue.

While this is by no means definite - even the SteamDB listing, which leaked the date, clearly states that the "Steam API release date [...] may be wrong" - the update was changed on 15th April 2022, amended from 10th November to 13th December, 2022 (thanks, PCGN).

While either date could be a placeholder, of course, the good news is that we probably don't have to wait that long to find out exactly what the release date will be; Innersloth has confirmed it'll be at Facebook's Meta Quest Gaming Showcase this coming Wednesday, and the hope is we'll find out one way or the other then. We'll keep you posted.

Launching on 19th April, Unshackled will include the return of Flashpoint, where the ability to regenerate health and shield is removed, along with healing and shield loot. Instead you must get to Flashpoint zones to regen health although, as you may well expect, you may have to fight for control of it…

There's also the usual new themed cosmetics  - badges, charms, skins, and the like - and new weekly challenges to take on, too.

As reported by Reuters (thanks, PC Gamer), Chinese government agency The National Radio and Television Administration has justified the move by insisting that "for a period of time, issues such as chaotic online livestreaming and teenage addiction to games have raised widespread concerns in society and effective measures need to be taken urgently".

The statement seemingly comes after some fans were able to view games China deems as "unauthorised" - such as Elden Ring - via Chinese streaming platforms, even though many are not available to buy in the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Rise's Sunbreak expansion is drawing ever-nearer to its June release on PC and Switch, and, in anticipation of its eventual arrival, Capcom has offered a closer look at its new Citadel map and new armoured monkey monster Garangolm in action.


Come Sunbreak's release, players will have the opportunity to depart for new climes, with the bustling port town of Elgado Outpost serving as the expansion's colourful new hub area. From there, it's just a short hop to Sunbreak's brand-new map, The Citadel - which combines a diverse range of biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece.


Capcom describes The Citadel - said to be a once thriving, but now devastated part of the kingdom, slowly being reclaimed by nature - as a "key location" for Sunbreak's new Master Rank quests in its video showcase, taking viewers on tour of the castle and its surroundings biomes, as well as offering a glimpse of the location's new endemic life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With season 3 of Netflix's The Witcher adaptation now officially in production, the streaming service is beginning to loosen its lips about what's in store, and that includes casting news for four characters being introduced as part of the series' third outing.


Netflix confirmed filming on season 3 was officially underway earlier this month, sharing a behind-the-scenes shot of the show's Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri (that is, Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan) on-set and in the snow. It also offered a brief summary of where things will be heading following the conclusion of last season, revealing that it'll see Geralt taking Ciri of Cintra into hiding.


"Entrusted with Ciri’s magical training," the streaming service explained, "Yennefer leads them to the protected fortress of Aretuza, where she hopes to discover more about the girl’s untapped powers; instead, they discover they’ve landed in a battlefield of political corruption, dark magic, and treachery."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following recent claims developer Criterion's new Need for Speed game could be launching as soon as November, it's now been reported the racer will be set in a fictional version of Chicago and will combine a "photo-realistic" art style with "anime elements".
That's according to VentureBeat’s Jeff Grubb, who discussed the long-awaited project in the latest episode of his Grubbsnax show. Elaborating on his claims the new Need for Speed would "be photo-realistic, but it’s going to have on top of that, anime elements", Grubb (as thanks VGC) explained, "You know when you see a car commercial or something like that and the car’s driving around, but then cartoons flames and stuff are flying off it? That’s the kind of the aesthetic that they seem to be going for."
Away fron Need for Speed's new visual style, Grubb also claimed the racer will take place in a fictionalised version of Chicago, known as Lake Shore City, and that various familiar features would be returning for this latest Need for Speed instalment. These are said to include Autolog and its multiplayer focused social tools, plus the ability to "customise all the pieces of your car".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its latest earnings report, CD Projekt has confirmed Cyberpunk 2077's previously announced paid expansion - which the developer says will deliver a "new storyline" - is now expected to arrive next year, and that additional DLC is in the works.


Details on Cyberpunk 2077's paid story expansion have remained limited following CD Projekt's decision to switch its development focus to fixing the base game in response to its disastrous launch at the tail-end of 2020. The developer had originally intended to discuss its expansion plans prior to the game's release, meaning additional information is long overdue.


Mentions of Cyberpunk 2077's expansion have been sporadic at best since launch, but it seems CD Projekt is now ready to discuss it in slightly more definite terms, with the developer confirming, unsurprisingly, that it'll feature a "new storyline", and that it'll be launching in 2023. That's all it's saying for now, however, with more information due to be shared "later this year".

Inspired by Eurogamer's best games of 2022 so far list, and ahead of a long weekend of gaming here in the UK, now's a good time to chat about what has kept us interested this spring. 


Horizon: Forbidden West arrived with huge fanfare, and seems like it did a good job of providing more of the original's sense of adventure - but did it fall a little flat in the face of Elden Ring? January saw the launch of the new PS5 version of Uncharted: Lost Legacy - but what's next for the biggest of Sony's blockbuster franchises?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amnesia: Rebirth, the third outing in developer Frictional Games' historical horror series, will be next week's free Epic Store game, alongside couch-based co-op dungeon-crawler Riverbond.


Rebirth - which follows on from Frictional's 2010 original and its Chinese-Room-developed successor A Machine for Pigs - whisks players back to the 1930s for an unsettling adventure across the Algerian desert. This time around, the focus is on protagonist Tasi Trianon as she attempts to navigate the sandy, hostile expanse, piecing together fragments of her past (and occasionally dealing with unspeakable horrors) along the way. 


Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake called Rebirth an "impressive horror subversion" and a story that "gripped me right up until the credits rolled" when she reviewed it back in 2020, so it's an outing that's well worth your time - and there's even an Adventure Mode that cuts back on the suffocating darkness, jump scares, and deadly monsters for faint-hearted players that just want to dabble in its puzzling and engaging story.

Season three, Classified Arms, is set to release on the 27th April with the franchise's connected universe storyline progressing with the release of "Nebula bombs" by the Nazis. 


But the cinematic trailer also teases something bigger: "With Nebula, the Nazis had unwittingly shaken something awake, something far more powerful and fearsome than anything we could ever hope to comprehend."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scarlet Nexus has seen its player base boosted by a million players from Xbox Game Pass, publisher Bandai Namco said today. 
The announcement came as the game passed the two million player figure overall - with the other million coming from 1m copies shipped to retailers and sold digitally (thanks, RPGSite).
It's intriguing to see the RPG gain such a large reach through Microsoft's subscription service - at a time when the power of being included in these has been under the spotlight. The action RPG was added to Game Pass back in September last year.

PlayStation Trophy data for this new addition has been detailed in a new video from Access the Animus, which suggests based on prior release timings we should see the new content go live within the next couple of weeks.


Dubbed "Mastery Challenge: The Reckoning (Part 2)" this is expected to add fresh combat challenge maps to rinse and repeat for high scores, and hopefully some closure to what the mode's vendor Hildiran is really up to.

The Chinese-language video originated on YouTube before being shared by popular Overwatch personality (coach and streamer) Stylosa.
In it, we get a HUD-less montage showing what Sojourn - Overwatch's first black female character - can do. We see her dual-purpose gun, which has what looks like a machine-gun primary fire and a railgun alternate fire. And judging by the video, the railgun is deadly and potentially passes through enemies too.

Scrabble Web, as this new online version of the classic word game is sensibly and unfussily known, delivers all the letter-plopping thrills of the board game original, albeit it in a free, easily accessible new digital guise. And while it might be relatively low on frills right now, it does at least feature a fairly solid range of options when it comes to ways to play.
For starters, there's a solo mode, pitting players against an AI opponent, but also some competitive PvP for those that prefer to test their word prowess against living, breathing challengers - be they randoms or friends - all served up in selectable flavours of match length, lasting between 3 and 45 minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher 3's long-awaited PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S version has been delayed indefinitely following CD Projekt's decision to move its development in-house.
An enhanced version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC - which would include the base game and its various expansions - was initially announced in September 2020, with CD Projekt promising to deliver the likes of ray-tracing and faster load times. All this would be made available as both a standalone version and as a free upgrade to those that already owned the game on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
It was a generous offer, but very little has been heard of the project since, with CD Projekt only intermittently mentioning it - usually in conjunction with word of another delay - as it continued its attempts to manage the fallout from Cyberpunk 2077's disastrous launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Niantic's next game involves caring for and breeding fictional creatures - but it's nothing to do with Pokémon. Instead, Peridot is a brand new creation by Niantic itself - the company's first for many years - and one it's aiming at an even wider audience.


With Peridot, Niantic seems to be gunning for the now-vacant Neopets market (RIP Neopets), with cutesy Pixar-esque characters, Tamagotchi-style gameplay and - because this is a Niantic game - a good old nudge every so often to get you off your sofa.


"We want it to be a standalone pet simulation game," producer Ziah Fogel told Eurogamer this week via Zoom call, when asked why it was building a new app separate to Pokémon Go. Niantic's mission here, she continued, was to iterate on and improve the popular pet simulation genre. You'll be able to try it for yourself soon, too - it arrives in soft launch in certain countries within the next few weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The California Department of Fair Employment's ongoing harassment and discrimination lawsuit against Activision Blizzard - which accused the publisher of fostering a "frat boy culture" in which sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive - has taken another dramatic turn. A state of California lawyer involved in the lawsuit has resigned, accusing the state's governor of interfering in the case in support of Activision Blizzard.


As reported by Bloomberg, the assistant chief counsel for California’s Department of Fair Employment, Melanie Proctor, has quit her role in protest after California Governor Gavin Newsom "abruptly fired" the agency's boss, Chief Counsel Janette Wipper. A representative for the two attorneys has since confirmed the firing and resignation to Bloomberg.


In an email to staff seen by the publication, Proctor claimed Governor Gavin Newsom and his office had begun to "interfere" with the Activision lawsuit in recent weeks. “The Office of the Governor repeatedly demanded advance notice of litigation strategy and of next steps in the litigation,” Proctor wrote. “As we continued to win in state court, this interference increased, mimicking the interests of Activision’s counsel.”

In this all-new adventure, players will take on the role of Nori Kaga, a food cart chef who has her sights set on making it into the big time, just like her role mode - the glamourous Chef Rhubarb.

The game itself will feature "hundreds of recipes" for players to whip up, as well as multiple other side quests, with gameplay "that stimulates the rhythm and tactility of cooking".

Well, wonder no more, as someone has brought these two pieces of media together as one, and I won’t lie, it is a match made in (a far from angelic) heaven. 
Using footage from 1987’s Evil Dead 2 and 1992’s Army of Darkness, content creator eli_handle_b․wav has replaced Resident Evil Village protagonist Ethan Winters with Ash. The results are both horrifying and amusing all in one. 
Instead of ripping himself free from Lady Dimitrescu’s clutches a la Ethan, this rendition of Village sees new hero Ash instead shimmying up to his towering captor and offering to open a bottle of champagne (I mean, someone was going to do it eventually, just look at her).

"My first [MMORPG] was EverQuest. I got absolutely addicted to it and forced a dozen or so SquareSoft staff members at the time to play as well, telling them it was required knowledge. Incredibly, most of them got hooked too, which led to [Final Fantasy 11]," he said.

Chatting to Xbox Expansion Pass, Lanning said his team initially thought they would sell roughly 50k units of Oddworld: Soulstorm, and certainly no more than 100k. The studio was also looking for some financial help to keep the game alive, and as such, when Sony approached the team offering an undisclosed amount of money to put its game on PS Plus for its release month, Lanning jumped at the chance. 
However, the game's release was delayedby three months due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. And with the game's later release, Lanning said, more people than previously estimated now had access to a PlayStation 5.

Unfortunately, this cute toy has caught the attention of scalpers looking to resell the figure for plenty of credits on its own. You can't get this version of the minifigure anywhere else - and this is driving up its price on eBay (thanks, Nintendo Life).

Options in the marketing survey obtained by Wowhead include digital toys, pets and mounts, as well as character transfers, level boosts and game time. 


Several price points are mentioned, including $50 (£38) and $30 (£23) options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One scientist has answered the question surely on everyone's minds since The Elder Scrolls 5 released over a decade ago – just what would Skyrim's skeletons look like if they were alive today? Well, it turns out, they would look like disgruntled cavemen.
Thanks to facial reconstruction technology, Twitter user Sulkalmakh from the Ancestral Whispers cranial reconstruction research team brought Skyrim's bony boys to life, as it were.
In a playful tweet from April Fool's Day (via IGN), the user shared their "Facial reconstruction of an ancient Atmoran from Saarthal, dated to the late Merethic Era". This may well have gone over the heads of many, but eagle-eyed fans were soon quick to realise that the face staring back at them on the screen was indeed that of a (now fully fleshed) Skyrim Skeleton.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny developer Bungie has committed to a new "digital-first" hiring policy, and said that "most current and future roles will be fully remote eligible". 


The move contrasts with recent pushes from companies such as Call of Duty maker Activision and League of Legends studio Riot Games, who seem keener to get staff back in offices - leading to Covid safety concerns. 


Bungie has said it will allow remote work from a number of US states (likely due to local tax laws - thanks, Kotaku) including the developer's home of Washington, plus others including California, Florida and Texas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo support studio Certain Affinity has said it is "deepening" its relationship with the series' main developer 343 Industries, and is now at work on "evolving" Halo Infinite further. 


Certain Affinity has assisted with Halo development as far back as Halo 2, where it worked on extra maps for that game. Subsequently, it has served as a co-developer for 343 on Halo Waypoint, Reach, Halo 4 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.


Its continued work on the series with Halo Infinite comes as little surprise, then, but the language it has used - and an earlier report on what it might be up to - point to a major addition to Infinite coming from Certain Affinity in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been itching to turn to the darker side in No Man's Sky, developer Hello Games' exploratory space sim has you covered in its new Outlaws update, giving players the chance to trade their life of relatively wholesome interplanetary meandering and base building for one of rather more criminal pursuits as they take on the role of fearsome space pirates.


Just as February's Sentinels update sought to improve ground combat, Outlaws aims to do the same for space combat. That means better ship handling, shields for enemy starships, plus visual enhancements and various specialist secondary effects for weapons. The latter for instance, might give players the ability to slow enemy engines or disable their shield systems. Additionally, combat can now move down into a planet's atmosphere and AI pirates can even attack your settlements - and if all that sounds a little intimidating, Hello Games has introduced a new Auto-Follow mode to improve combat accessibility.


Elsewhere, there's a brand-new class of ship in the form of the sleek, solar-powered, and rather unimaginatively named Solar Starship (plus the maximum number of ships players can store has now been increased to nine), and it's now possible to create squadrons, recruiting and upgrading AI wingmen, each with their own unique abilities, for assistance in battle. Oh, and all ships now have high-capacity (and expandable) cargo inventories for specialist goods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has provided additional details of next week's World of Warcraft expansion reveal, confirming the event - previously announced to be airing on Tuesday, 19th April - will commence at 5pm BST/6pm CEST/9am PT/12pm ET.


"World of Warcraft has ignited imaginations through rich storytelling and expansive worlds that prevail throughout the Shadowlands expansion," Blizzard wrote in an its announcement of today's news. "From the hopeless depths of the Maw to the ethereal plains of Zereth Mortis, the Shadowlands delivers a world that challenges heroes to confront the forces that threaten to upset the cosmic balance between life and death. With the story in the Shadowlands coming to a conclusion, the time is at hand to get a sneak peek at what’s next for the heroes of Azeroth."


As for what maybe next for the long-running MMO, that's still somewhat unclear, but Warcraft-focused website Wowhead reports (thanks VGC) that data found in the source code of the official World of Warcraft website suggests the new expansion will be called Dragonflight, with Base, Heroic, and Epic Expansion pre-pruchases seemingly set to become available following next week's reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last March, John Wick director Chad Stahelski announced he was working on a movie adaptation of PlayStation samurai adventure Ghost of Tsushima, and now, a little over a year later, a writer for the project has been named.
As reported by Deadline, the new Ghost of Tsushima film adaptation will be penned by Takashi Doscher, who previously wrote and directed romantic sci-fi romance, Only, alongside ESPN documentary A Fighting Chance.
Deadline says the adaptation is still in "early development" and, as such, details remain scarce. However, the publication previously confirmed the project - a collaboration between Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions - will, perhaps unsurprisingly, follow the adventures of game protagonist Jin Sakai. Will there be Hot Spring butt? Only time will tell.

        <updated>2022-04-12T20:42:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beamdog, the developer perhaps best known for its remasters of Black Isle Studios classics such as Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment, has unveiled MythForce, a new first-person fantasy rogue-lite inspired by the Saturday morning cartoons of the 80s.
First things first, MythForce looks kind of glorious, doing an admirable job of capturing the ambiance of any number of 80s cartoon favourites, albeit rendered in full 3D. There's a definite air of the fondly remembered Dungeons & Dragons' animated outing about it, for instance (with a little bit of arcade cult-classic Dragon's Lair thrown in), which is entirely fitting given Beamdog describes its game as a first-person swords & sorcery adventure.
At MythForce's core is a roguelite dungeon-crawling experience that sees up to four co-op players - in the role of either Victoria the valiant Knight, Rico the charming Rogue, Maggie the wise Mage, and Hawkins the deadly Hunter - storming a colourful cartoon castle packed with "treasure, traps, and terrors". Beamdog is promising to arm players with "legendary weapons and powerful magic" as they attempt to survive the forces of evil within.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring's late-game bosses are tough, so what better way to ease the pain of FromSoftware latest epic than by cutting out the middle man and getting one boss to fight another boss on your behalf? We've already had one such showdown before, pitting Malenia against Starcourge Radahn (and his pal Leonard the horse), and the victor of that skirmish is now back, this time taking on Maliketh, the Black Blade.


This latest battle of Elden Ring's elite comes courtesy of the Garden of Eyes, the same modder that bought Malenia face to face with Radahn (and that also pitted Bloodborne's Lady Maria against Resident Evil Village's Lady Dimitrescu), this time promising the "ultimate battle of the Shardbearers" and delivering a whole lot of pyrotechnics as the two fight it out.


Those who've yet to enter the gauntlet of carefully curated misery that makes up Elden Ring's final stretch will obviously want to steer clear of Garden of Eyes' latest head-to-head for obvious spoiler reasons, but those eager to see who reigns victorious this time around simply need to watch the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you feel like you need to see even more of Master Chief's derriere after his naked TV debut last week, well I have good news - there is a mod that lets you play Halo Infinite in third person.
The PC mod in question comes from Opulent Halo (via PC Gamer). While the mod is actually a few months old now, many have been recently diving back into Halo Infinite to see how Master Chief (at least his video game form) looks from this new angle. Perhaps Paramount has whetted some appetites?
In a video showing off the mod in action, the creator wrote, "after my novice modding skills in Halo Infinite, I wondered what third person would look like... [spoiler alert] it's amazing".

That's exactly what YouTuber Flurdeh has done. Using camera tools by Frans Bouma, they've used a tilt shift lens and isometric view to create a video of the Lands Between from above (thanks PC Gamer).


Though not a full mod, it somewhat reimagines the game as a CRPG, Miyazaki's bleak world becoming adorable little dioramas with tiny model enemies shuffling around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have lifted the curtain on their new action-adventure IP, Hell is Us. 
In a joint press release, the companies gave a brief and somewhat haunting synopsis for the game. "The almost total self-sufficiency of the country hides a dark secret: the recent appearance of supernatural creatures resembling ancient headstones and monuments in the region,” the Hell is Us team explained. "The citizens call this phenomenon 'the Calamity'. Armed with weapons specially forged to fight these monsters, the protagonist must learn how to defeat them and use his equipment wisely."
To accompany this announcement, a new teaser for Hell is Us was also debuted. This trailer gives off strong Kojima vibes, and shows off the game's dystopian country, which is ravaged by civil war. In the words of Ed Nightingale, "It’s like Death Stranding with a sword". You can check out the trailer for yourself below.

The feature will let anyone on PC, Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S play these games' campaigns co-operatively online together.


In patch notes, developer 343 Industries said the cross-play had been tested internally - though the company now needed "additional insight from real players with different networking setups". If you experience issues, you're encouraged to report them so 343 can improve the feature further.

The new building (red in the diagram below) will sit next to other Nintendo buildings (in pink) and be open by the end of December 2027 (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). Maybe we'll have Switch 3 by then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wingspan, the rather lovely digital adaptation of Stonemaier Games' equally lovely bird-themed board game, will be ushering a fresh flock of avians into its welcoming habitats from 5th May, come the launch of its first major gameplay DLC, the European Expansion.


Wingspan's European Expansion builds on the core game's soothing, strategic deck building - which Eurogamer's Robert Purchese was rather taken with when he first put it through its paces some time back now - by introducing 81 new bird cards from the European area, each accompanied by a recording of its actual sound.


These new birds will bring a range of fresh abilities for use during play - such as the option to steal other players' food, to place cards on already played cards, and to reset the bird feeder - and you'll find a little more in the way of specifics on the official European Expansion website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has confirmed a sequel to its Arcade Stadium retro compilation is on the way - consisting of 32 more classic titles - after references to a follow-up were spotted on the South Korean game classification website earlier this month.


Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium, as the sequel is known, will follow the same modular release model as its predecessor, consisting of a free base download that includes one game and offering additional titles to purchase from within the collection. Quite why Capcom has decided a sequel is necessary, given the modular, expandable nature of the original, is currently unclear.


"The second Capcom Arcade Stadium title featuring a recreated arcade full of authentic cabinets to play", is how the publisher describes the sequel in a reference on Steam, promising "a new lineup of masterpieces!". And in a seperate tweet, it's now confirmed that lineup will total 32 arcade classics when it comes to Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC this June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New figures show that player numbers for DICE's Battlefield 2042 keep on falling, with less than 1000 concurrent users playing via Steam this morning.
A thread on ResetEra revealed that as few as 979 players were shown to be taking part in the game on Steam earlier today, with a peak of 2411 players in the last 24 hours. In comparison, 2018’s Battlefield 5 had a peak of 20,913 players over the same 24-hour period.
These numbers are pretty dire for such a relatively new game, especially one in such a longstanding series, but at this point aren't a surprise. After all, in November, Vikki reported that Battlefield 2042 was one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time, with one user stating the game's “issues are endless”.

TT Games' epic compilation of all nine films is the UK's second-biggest boxed launch of the year so far, behind Pokémon Legends Arceus.

This new record was achieved by Distortion 2, who has previously achieved and broken many other Elden Ring speed running records. This included the game's first sub-20 run in March.
20 minutes now seems like eons for the streamer, as their new record is an impressive 8 minutes and 56 seconds.

Fittingly, this scene appears to be placed in a forest area - which looks very like the forest moon of Endor. Hey! Maybe this means Kingdom Hearts 4 will get Ewoks too?

Interestingly, this makes it Jim Carrey's biggest domestic opener ever, eclipsing 2003's Bruce Almighty which grossed $68m during it's opening weekend in the States. It also marks Paramount's fifth number-one movie of the pandemic, too.

As Tom summarised for us earlier this week, eFootball - the new name for PES - arrived in a disastrous state late last year, even though Konami warned players it would arrive in extremely limited form akin to a demo.
Now, however, the beleaguered publisher has acknowledged the "incompletion" of the game to our sister site VGC, pointing the finger to several factors it believes contributed to the game's dreadful reception on release.

Angels of the Zariman focuses its multitude of new additions around the lore-critical Zariman Ten Zero, an Orokin ship that vanished during a Void-Jump accident. Front and centre of the update is a new instalment in Warframe's single-player, story driven Cinematic Quest saga, which this time sets the scene by taking Tenno aboard the Zariman Ten Zero.
Then, once the mission is complete, players will gain access to Chrysalith, a new social hub onboard the Zariman, which introduces a range of new NPC, side missions, and objectives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tired of those infernal video games, always insisting on being so darned interactive? Well, developer Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology) has you covered in its next horror title The Quarry, which comes with its very own Movie Mode.


Movie Mode, just as it sounds, lets players (or rather viewers, in this instance) watch the entirety of The Quarry's summer-camp-flavoured horror in linear, non-interactive fashion - meaning you can simply plop your bot on the sofa, grab your popcorn with two controller-free hands, and soak up its scares with only minimal exertions from yourself.


As detailed in a new IGN preview (thanks PC Gamer), The Quarry's Movie Mode will come in three different flavours: Everybody Lives, Everybody Dies, and Director's Chair. The first two are pretty self-explanatory, determining whether The Quarry's cast members - including the likes of Lance Henriksen, Grace Zabriskie, David Arquette, Ted Raimi, Justice Smith, and Skyler Gisondo - manage to survive their experience at Hackett's Quarry summer camp to live another day.

EA confirmed a new Criterion-developed Need for Speed game was in the works at the tail-end of 2020, slapping it with a vague release window of somewhere between April 2021 and the end of March this year. However, that launch was later delayed to EA's fiscal year 2023, with the publisher announcing it had made the decision to move Criterion away from Need for Speed to help DICE "deliver the best [Battlefield] experience possible to our players".


With Battlefield 2042 now launched, Criterion's attention has reportedly returned to Need for Speed, with EA said to be looking to release its long-awaited racer this November. That's according to VentureBeat's Jeff Grubb who, speaking in the latest episode his GrubbSnax show (thanks WCCF Tech), also claimed this latest series instalment will forego a console release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, instead targeting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pirate Legends yearning for some adventure to really test their nautical prowess will finally get their wish from 21st April, when Sea of Thieves launches Legend of the Veil - a brand-new, story driven quest designed exclusively for the piratical cream of the crop.


Rare initially teased Legend of the Veil during its Sea of Thieves' 2022 roadmap reveal back in January, and with a release date for the adventure now confirmed, the developer has shared more on what players can expect to see come its arrival.


While Sea of Thieves' existing Pirate-Legend-focused Athena Voyages are little more than a clutch of Trading Company tasks strung together into one lengthy quest, Legend of the Veil is aiming to be rather more ambitious, blending the cinematic presentation of previous Tall Tales adventures - complete with cut-scenes, music, and voice work - with the randomness and replayability of standard voyages.

XCOM 2 is, of course, a bit of a winner, refining the base-building, alien-annihilating turn-based tactics of its 2012 predecessor (itself a refinement of Julian Gollop's classic X-COM series) to create a prettier, tougher, richer game of extraterrestrial slaughter.


As Chris Bratt put it in his 2016 review, "XCOM 2 isn't a reworking of the original game...it's a genuine response to it... Moment to moment, the thing that makes this astonishing game truly sing is the way in which it's managed to respond to the bad habits we picked up last time around. Move faster, it urges. Take more risks. Become a more interesting player."

Employees told Vice that Riot's decision to drop its mask mandate and stop testing for unvaccinated employees put them at risk, as hybrid working with three days in the office per week was being encouraged as the new norm. 


Today's report comes just a week after similar criticisms and staff walkouts at Activision, which also has studios in California. Both companies said the changes reflected their state's recent relaxation in Covid safety rules - despite rising case numbers due to the Omicron BA2 subvariant.

Chatting with me about all this - and what we'd like to see revived next - are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy. We discuss playing as a digital Sam Lake, mangle poor Guybrush's name, and hum the F-Zero theme tune.

Around a decade ago, plans were in place for director Scott Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill to adapt Eidos Montreal's popular cyberpunk shooter into a film. But it wasn't to be.


Derrickson and Cargill were snapped up by Marvel to make Doctor Strange, and without the duo onboard, production company CBS Films lost interest and moved on.

Developer Blizzard has not yet commented on the change, though fans have spotted the "Z" has now disappeared in the game's most recent update (thanks, PC Gamer).
It's not hard to guess why this change has occured now. The "Z" symbol has recently become co-opted by Putin-supporting Russian citizens and emblazoned on military vehicles currently involved in the country's devastating invasion of Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working your way through Moreau’s watery swamp pit in Resident Evil Village, players were reportedly once set to encounter a range of new creatures, including mermaids. But as is to be expected from a Resident Evil game, these mermaids were not going to be the Disney princess versions akin to the likes of Ariel and her family. Rather, they were going to a (literal) monstrous pain for Ethan Winters and players.
Reliable Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem, who has a record of insider knowledge on the series' development, has shared more details on Moreau’s area within the game, as well as the enemies players would encounter there. When discussing the mermaid like enemies that were ultimately cut from the final release, Dusk Golem revealed:
"In the water they could swim for you quickly if [they] spotted you, and you had to get to patches of land or kill them successfully before they reached you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has only been out a couple of days, but players are already getting creative with some of its quirks. 


For example, you can't kill children in the game - and players have found that by chaining lightsaber attacks against these invulnerable younglings, you can essentially levitate and hover to places you'd normally struggle to reach. 


Specifically, people are beating up little Episode 1-era Anakin Skywalker, who will simply glow red from repeated lightsaber damage. (Normally, whacking your party members with lightsabers sends them tumbling apart into their Lego components.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first big fix for Gran Turismo 7's launch issues – chiefly its grim grind made all the more unpalatable by the presence of microtransactions – is now live, boosting payouts for campaign and online events and making some other welcome changes along the way. 
New events have been introduced, with big races at Le Mans, Sardegna and Tokyo Expressway slotting in alongside other tweaked races towards the end of the campaign that now all deliver bigger payouts. There are new 1 hour endurance events available once you've reached Collector Level 23 – all coming under 'The Human Comedy' banner, which is rather apt for the discipline – while online events will also now offer bigger payouts. Elsewhere the in-game credit cap has been lifted and more legendary cars will be listed in the auction house at any one time. 
And there's more! Off-road physics, which were a bit waywards, have now been grounded, some graphical tweaks have taken place and plenty more besides – you can see the full rundown of what's new in Gran Turismo 7 version 1.11 in the extensive patchnotes.

As Kubernetes evolves, features and APIs are regularly revisited and removed. New features may offer
an alternative or improved approach to solving existing problems, motivating the team to remove the
old approach. Old APIs are first deprecated and then removed according to the Kubernetes Deprecation Policy.
We want to make sure you are aware of the changes coming in the Kubernetes 1.24 release. The release will
deprecate several (beta) APIs in favor of stable versions of the same APIs. The major change coming
in the Kubernetes 1.24 release is the removal of Dockershim. This is discussed
below and will be explored in more depth at release time. For an early look at the changes coming in Kubernetes 1.24, take a look at the in-progress CHANGELOG.

The way Pokémon Go has handled Mega Evolution - a popular mechanic from the monster franchise's main games - has been criticised since its arrival in August 2020, although it has been improved over time. 


These upcoming potential changes - which, to be clear, are yet to be finalised and announced by developer Niantic - seem like they'll go a lot further to address recurrent gripes and encourage more regular Mega Evolution as part of daily play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami will attempt to salvage its struggling eFootball 2022 next week with the game's long-awaited v1.0.0 patch - which was originally set to arrive soon after launch last November.


eFootball - the new name for PES - arrived in a disastrous state late last year, despite Konami warning players it would arrive in extremely limited form akin to a demo. 


Konami insisted the game would evolve over time, but players have been left waiting months for this v1.0.0 update to arrive. In the meantime, eFootball's mobile spin-off was postponed, and the game's controversial premium player pack was pulled from sale.

While not enough to trouble the likes of perenial Steam favourites, or rival the enormous Steam launch of Elden Ring, it is worth pointing out how good a launch Lego Star Wars has had compared to other games in the series.


The Skywalker Saga hit an 82,445 player peak on its launch day,  compared to numbers around the ~5000 player mark for Marvel Super Heroes, The Hobbit, Ninjago and Lord of the Rings (thanks, BenjiSales).

Mining, cave exploration and combat also feature, alongside expanded customisation options for your home. Here's a new trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After its game-changing reveal on PlayStation 5 and following a period of early access, Unreal Engine 5 is finally available for general download. In combination with the release, Epic is releasing a cut-down, Keanu-free rendition of the remarkable The Matrix Awakens demo alongside a sample game project to experiment with, called Lyra. UE5's release takes centre stage in today's State of Unreal virtual event, and we're told to expect a range of tech deep dives surrounding the technology alongside the launch of the engine itself.


UE5 takes the established Unreal Engine 4.27 and adds full support for a number of key next generation technologies. We've already seen these in action, of course. Lumen is Epic's take on a fully real-time global illumination solution, eliminating the need to rely on static, pre-calculated 'baked' lighting, leaning into hardware accelerated ray tracing where appropriate. Nanite is UE5's virtualised micro-polygon technology, delivering incredibly granular detail from assets of motion picture quality and the elimination of geometry 'pop-in'. 


The demands of these systems are such that native rendering at 4K resolution is not feasible on today's game consoles and that ties into another key feature: Temporal Super Resolution. Recently seen for the first time in a non-UE5 title – Ghostwire: Tokyo – TSR is the best software-based temporal upscaling solution we've seen to date. In upscaling from a native 1080p to 4K – a 2x resolution boost on both axes – the quality is comparable (if not quite as good as) Nvidia's DLSS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hypnospace Outlaw is getting a sequel. Well, a spiritual sequel called Dreamsettler. But it's almost exactly the same thing: a detective game set in an old version of the internet, which you'll trawl to uncover a mystery.
And there's more: another new game called Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer. It's more of an accompaniment or spin-off, and it's fictitiously made by Hypnospace Outlaw character Zane! Though developer Tendershoot and publisher No More Robots are so committed to this fiction they'll even apparently roleplay as Zane when answering questions on Steam forums and so on.
The Slayer X game is like retro Doom, or Duke Nukem 3D - a game in that vein. It's pixelated and filled with trashy gore and ridiculous weaponry. And if you know the story of Hypnospace Outlaw, you'll know Zane is out for revenge. He apparently found an old CD-ROM with the game on and decided to brush it up for a noughties audience.

Coming in April is the Glaivier, a new female martial artist advanced class who weaves together attacks with a spear and glaive depending on the two stances she uses: Focus and Flurry.


"“"While certain builds may focus your attention onto one of these weapons, an effective Glaivier can maximize their potential by creating balance between the two stances, building up energy in one stance which grants an impactful stat-boost when swapping to the other,"”" reads the blog post.

In this new game, players will be pitted against each other in 5v5 matches, or "Attack vs Defence". As the name suggests, attackers will have to gain intel on their enemy by deploying drones and breaching "walls, floors and ceilings". Meanwhile, those on the defence team will have to ensure their intel is secure with the use of spy cameras and traps.

Speaking to IGN, Hasan Kahraman of Blue Box Game Studios said the developer had removed older tweets about the game in a bid to keep information surrounding Abandoned up to date. "Basically, the tweets were deleted because some of the concept has changed, and I figured maybe just deleting the tweet and then tweeting more relevant information would be a better idea - which was actually not a good idea," Kahraman said.
"I have learned now just to keep them. Even if the information or concept changed, just keep the older information because people eventually will see for themselves what the difference is and then see what's more actual."

Last week, the embattled World of Warcraft and Call of Duty maker announced it would no longer require office-based staff to have had Covid jabs, while encouraging a gradual return to in-person working over the coming months.


The decision, announced in an email by Activision Blizzard exec Brian Bulatao, was immediately criticised by staff who said it risked employees who may be immunocompromised or who lived with others who are, and was poorly timed as the US faces up to Covid's current Omicron BA2 subvariant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper, the really promising new game by In Other Waters developer Jump Over the Age, will be released 5th May.

Excitingly, it'll be available day-one on Xbox Game Pass, on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. It'll also be available on PC from a number of stores (Steam, GOG, Epic, Humble), and - this just in - Nintendo Switch. There's no PlayStation version, sadly.

I played a demo of Citizen Sleeper recently and was impressed. It's a mash-up of a board game and an RPG. There's a lot of descriptive text and dialogue choices, as you'd get in an RPG, and there's levelling up and skills and that kind of thing. But it all plays out in a turn-based, board game kind of way, and quite a lot of what you can do depends on dice you roll at the beginning of each turn. It takes a bit of getting used to.

Ubisoft has not trumpeted the arrival of the new eight-player offering, dubbed Countdown, and it's easy to see why. The new mode has launched while the very real fight for control of Chernobyl power station has been in the headlines, during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 


Of course, the mode has been in development for some time - and was not created in response to the real-world crisis. The timing, however, is unforunate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has quietly removed an offer for PS Now in the wake of the announcement for its revamped PS Plus subscription.



An offer was previously available to purchase a year’s subscription to streaming service PS Now for $59.99 (on the US PSN). This was a particularly good deal as existing PS Now subscribers will automatically transfer to the Premium tier of the new PS Plus worth $119.99 a year.


However, PS Now can currently only be purchased on a monthly basis (£8.99). Once the new PS Plus launches, PS Now will no longer be available as a standalone product so players will move to the equivalent tier at £13.49 monthly.

<blockquote><p>In case you&#8217;re wondering, no, that is not normal in the security community. While experts tell me that the concept of a &#8220;responsible disclosure timeline&#8221; is a little outdated and heavily depends on the situation, we&#8217;re generally measuring in <i>days</i>, not years. &#8220;The majority of researchers have policies where if they make a good faith effort to reach a vendor and don&#8217;t get a response, that they publicly disclose in 30 days,&#8221; Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and former chief security officer at Facebook, tells me...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Bulatao's email began by suggesting conditions in the US were currently improving - despite the rising tide of new cases brought by the increasingly-dominant Omicron BA.2 subvariant, and the relatively low percentage of US citizens protected by a Covid booster dose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week it was announced that the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been delayed into next year. This was not exactly a surprise, but a shame, nonetheless. But, to soften this blow slightly, Nintendo also shared a new, very small, snippet from the game. 
By snippet, I really do mean snippet. It was a "blink and you will miss it" situation. However, after playing it coy throughout Breath of the Wild 2's most recent trailer, this delay announcement did finally reveal the front of Link, and more of his corrupted arm (with said corruption looking like it is also starting to make its way across Link's chest).
It also showed the Master Sword looking a tad worse for wear. In fact, it looked downright ruined.

This was not exactly a surprise, but a shame, nonetheless. But, to soften this blow slightly, Nintendo also shared a new, very small, snippet from the game.

Cities: VR is the work of Fast Travel Games, and the developer stresses its new edition isn't a direct port of Skylines - "VR does not allow for the size and scale of the PC version", it notes - instead choosing to emphasise "more intimate experiences set in smaller areas".
Even so, it retains Skylines' core strategic city planning, giving players the tools to construct their metropolis piece by piece - from roads to neighbourhoods to districts - while juggling its economy, emergency services, and education and entertainment needs along the week.

Details published by Kotaku include allegations of sexism and mismanagement at the Microsoft-owned studio, and paint a picture of a game project which is still struggling to get off the ground years after its official reveal.
State of Decay 3 began pre-production in late 2018, though developers at Undead Labs were reportedly poorly-managed and the project took several team re-organisations to get off the ground. Staff have claimed the game's public announcement in 2020 was too early, and at that point Undead Labs "didn't even know what it was".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 - the, would you believe it, third game in developer Inti Creates' acclaimed side-scrolling action-platforming series - will be heading to Switch on 28th July.
The original Azure Striker Gunvolt, which launched to a solid reception on 3DS back in 2014, took its retro-infused cue from Capcom's beloved Mega Man series, with Inti Creates having previously worked on Mega Man Zero, ZX, 9, and 10 (Gunvolt was also executive produced by Mega Man's Keiji Inafune). A sequel arrived two years later, and both games can now be played on Switch via the Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack, if you're curious to learn more.
All of which brings us to Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 which, having initially been announced back in 2020, is now almost ready to for its Switch debut. The big change for this new outings is new playable character Kirin, bringing a new play-style as she battles foes using a combination of her speedy sword, throwable talismans, and Arc Chain ability, enabling her to close gaps instantly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't Starve Together, developer Klei Entertainment's co-operative multiplayer twist on its acclaimed survival adventure, will be making its way to Switch on 12th April.
If you've already played Don't Starve, you'll be right at home with Together; it takes the original's deliciously dark survival conceit - in which you awake in an expansive, wonderfully twisted world and must forage, maim, eat, and build in order to survive long enough to orchestrate an escape - but enables you to do it all with friends in tow.
There are three different modes available - Survival (in which players become revivable ghosts on death), the resurrection-free Wilderness, and a more leisurely Endless mode - all incorporating features from the original Don't Stare, its Reign of Giants expansion, plus elements from the Hamlet and Shipwrecked DLCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer WashBear Studio's relentlessly adorable (and highly enjoyable) dinosaur park management sim Parkasaurus will be welcoming a host of aquatic exhibits for the very first time come the arrival of its newly announced Sea Monsters expansion "soon".
Parkasaurus, if you're unfamiliar, takes obvious inspiration from the likes of Theme Park and DinoPark Tycoon, giving players all the tools they need to build and staff their very own dino-flavoured tourist attraction. Crucially, that involves providing the perfect habitats for a wide variety of adorable prehistoric creatures, with each dinosaur having specific terrain, water, food, privacy, and scenery requirements.
And once that's done, it's time to throw open the doors for an endless procession of guests, and they in turn have their own needs to be fulfilled - from places to eat to places to poop - if they're going to continue to spend, spend, spend. And hopefully not get eaten.

"The previous Minecraft Preview build available to Xbox Insiders inadvertently included prototype code for raytracing support on Xbox consoles," Microsoft said in a message posted to the official Minecraft Twitter account.
It added the "early prototype code" has now been removed from Minecraft Preview and that its recent appearance "doesn't signal near future plans to bring raytracing support to consoles."

E3's 2022 started to look shaky in January, when show organiser the ESA confirmed it wouldn't be holding a physical event this year due to potential risks from covid - though several journalists subsequently suggested it had actually been scrapped before Christmas - marking the third year in a row E3's in-person component has been cancelled.
Instead, there were reports the Entertainment Software Association was once again planning a digital offering in place of this year's live show - in a similar manner to last year's virtual event - but the organisation has now confirmed E3 will be skipping 2022 entirely.

While Hyper Light Drifter served up a tautly designed single-player adventure blending rich exploration with challenging melee combat in a strikingly presented top-down, 2D world, Hyper Light Breaker looks like a very different take on the same universe.
It all unfolds in the Overgrowth, a new "vast, ever-changing" (and fully 3D) world consisting of massive, open biomes and deep labyrinths - which players can navigate using the likes of wall-dashing, hoverboarding, and gliding. Here, they'll be able to "defeat brutal monsters, create new builds, survive the mysterious Crowns and overthrow the almighty Abyss King."

That's according to Windows Central's Jez Corden, who, citing "trusted sources familiar with with Microsoft's efforts", reports the family plan has been in the works for some time as Microsoft navigated issues around royalty distribution and third-party licenses. Those kinks are presumably close to being ironed out now, however, with Corden suggesting an official unveiling may happen relatively soon. 
As for what the family plan might offer, it'll reportedly enable five users in the same country to access Game Pass' entire library using a single membership, with the cost said to be "far cheaper" than paying for five individual subscriptions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Closing in on seven years after the launch of its hugely successful Kickstarter, Castelvania spiritual successor Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is still ticking off stretch goals, with its latest update delivering its third and final promised playable character - which turns out to be a cameo crossover from Ubisoft Montreal's fondly remembered fantasy platformer Child of Light.
"Aurora has lost her way and awoken in a strange, dangerous new land," explains developer ArtPlay in a new Kickstarter update. "Armed with the Sword of Matildis and accompanied by the loyal Igniculus, she must find a way to escape."
Upon downloading today's free 1.30 update, players can take Child of Light protagonist Aurora (who joins existing playable characters Miriam and Zangetsu, plus "bonus" character Bloodless) on a gothic romp through Bloodstained's familiar castle, making use of her sword, companion Igniculus - who can slow opponents or heal Aurora - and her directional Light Ray skill, which damages any enemies caught in its beam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, developer Sharkmob's free-to-play battle royale spin on the long-running RPG series, is getting its full PlayStation 5 and PC launch on 27th April.
Bloodhunt (not to be confused with Big Bad Wolf Studio's upcoming  RPG Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong, Paradox Interactive's troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, or indeed 2019 visual novel Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York) was announced toward the end of 2020 and had a limited Steam early access run the following year.
It is, all in all, pretty much exactly what it sounds like, casting participants - either playing solo or in a team of three - as vampires and setting them loose across the rain-soaked, moon-drenched streets and rooftops of Prague. All players have access to basic vampire trickery such as the ability to scramble up walls, but the characters they choose (from one of several vampire clans) inform the additional supernatural powers they're able to deploy. Oh, and there are lots and lots of guns to loot too, if you'd just rather just do the shooty thing.

While the direct Twitter sharing feature never got the chop in the live build of the Xbox dashboard - meaning the impact of its removal was limited - there were certainly grumbles from Insider testers after they were forced to grapple with more cumbersome methods of image and video sharing, requiring them to first upload clips to their phones, following the changes made in Microsoft's previous Insider build.
Now, however, in response Insider feedback, direct Twitter sharing has returned in Microsoft's last Beta Ring build. "Thanks for your feedback on the Twitter share feature change we flighted in 2204," Xbox Insider program lead Brad Rosetti wrote in a tweet. "That change is being reverted to the previous behaviour from today in this new build".

Break the Bank is all about the gold, and its centrepiece is an opulent depository for unimaginable riches known as The Bank. Mechanically, this is quite a bit different from other biomes so far added to developer Motion Twin's acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer, given that its entrance - a mysterious giant chest - will appear at random during a run.
Provided you've first completed its sole unlock criteria - reach the Hand of the King once - the chest can appear in any of Dead Cells' post-biome transition stages, and players will need to decide right then and there if they want to open it and delve into The Bank. If they decide yes, The Bank will replace the next biome along the path (it won't appear before a boss), but should they choose to forego its temptations, it won't reappear on the same run.

Stanley Parable's Ultra Deluxe edition was first announced back in 2018, with developers Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows (the respective studios of original Stanley Parable creator Davey Wreden and William Pugh, who co-designed the 2013 remake of the 2011 original) aiming to launch the following year. 2020 bought a second delay, and a hat-trick was achieved in 2021 - leaving many to ponder if the whole thing mightn't actually be some sort of mega-meta ruse and that the game didn't, and would never, exist.
Happy days are now here, however, with Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows having finally given the Ultra Deluxe edition a 27th April release date - 4/27, of course, being the number on Stanley's near-iconic office door. And if that's not appropriately self-referential enough for you, the announcement is accompanied by a recreation of the Stanley Parable's 2013 trailer - only this time the player goes left.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 30/3/22: Sony has now formally unveiled April's PlayStation Plus games line-up and, unsurprisingly given the veracity of previous PlayStation Plus leaks from French forum Dealabs, the official list remains unchanged.
That means, from 5th April, PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to download and play acclaimed card-battler Slay the Spire (PS4), Hood: Outlaws & Legends (PS4 & PS5), and SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated (PS4).
Sony has also warned PlayStation 5 owners that Persona 5 is being removed from its PlayStation Plus Collection on 11th May, meaning they should download it soon while the chance remains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks the launch of Intel's Arc A-series graphics family, the company's first discrete graphics cards to go head to head against industry titans AMD and Nvidia. To start, Team Blue is building its Arc GPUs for laptops, with entry-level Arc 3 models debuting now in laptops from $899. Higher-powered models called Arc 5 and Arc 7 are set to arrive early this summer, in higher-end machines. The company also teased its first desktop Arc graphics card at the very end of its presentation, showing off a much beefier design than the DG1 card shipped to developers last year. Here's what you need to know from Intel's Arc announcements.
First of all, the Arc series of graphics cards ought to be fully-featured models, with support for the full DirectX 12 Ultimate feature set (ray tracing, VRS, mesh shading, sampler feedback) plus DirectStorage and XeSS AI upscaling. That puts them on an even keel with Nvidia in terms of most features, and ahead of AMD who don't yet have a temporal upscaling solution. 
Intel detailed some specs for each of the five models announced thus far, including the number of Xe cores, ray tracing units and GDDR6 memory allocation. Given the relatively rapid scaling between families - we see a doubling of core count and VRAM from the top Arc 3 model to Arc 5, then another doubling to the top Arc 7 model - we could start to see very impressive performance from those top-end models.

The PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside PS5 back in 2020, giving PlayStation Plus members on Sony's new console access to 20 first- and third-party PlayStation 4 titles for as long as their subscription continued:
From 11th May, however, that impressive list will be down by one, as announced at the bottom of April's PlayStation Plus games reveal. Anyone still wishing to take advantage of Persona 5's inclusion still have time to do so, though - they'll just need to ensure they've added the game to their library prior to the 11th May deadline. As long as this is done, the game will continue to be available while a PlayStation Plus subscription is active.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed Industrial-Revolution-era city builder Anno 1800 has enjoyed significant success since its release in 2019 - having surpassed more than 2m players at last count - and Ubisoft is capitalising on its continuing popularity with a fourth season of DLC. That much we already knew, but now the publisher has provided early details of Season 4 - which will include the likes of airplanes and agricultural revolution - revealing its first DLC will arrive on 12th April.
As outlined in Ubisoft's new introductory video, Anno 1800's fourth season will introduce a total of three new paid DLCs before 2022 is through, with its first offering being titled Seeds of Change. Arriving on 12th April, this will enable players to "revolutionise" the agricultural sector of the New World, introducing a powerful new building - the Hacienda - that will become the agricultural hub of players' empires.
Expanding the Hacienda with its various modules will enable players to gain access to a range of new agriculture-centric features, including the ability to produce import goods in the New World (such as beer) in order to help the population become more independent. Additionally, players will be able to adopt island-wide policies and produce high-quality fertiliser to boost farms in both the New and Old Worlds.

Speaking to IGN, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 director Jeff Fowler stated the films will be a melting pot of ideas rather than directly paralleling the game series.

"It's not always going to be a linear progression of like 'Oh, this was in Sonic 2 so it's going to be in the Sonic 2 film'," he said. "It's going to be a little bit of a cherry picking, a little bit of a melting pot. There's so much great, inspiring imagery to pull from the 30 years of games. So if we didn't get it in one film, there's always the chance that we'll revisit it somewhere else."

According to the police, the man had, at some point, wrapped his Apple Watch across the spokes of the woman&#8217;s passenger side front car wheel and then used the Watch to track her movements. When police eventually confronted him, he admitted the Watch was his. Now, he&#8217;s reportedly being charged with attaching an electronic tracking device to the woman&#8217;s vehicle.</p></blockquote>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being used as a showcase for Xbox Series X/S' raytracing capabilities prior to the console's launch in 2020, Minecraft has so far remained doggedly raytracing-free on the machine. That looks to be about to change, however, with the feature having now surfaced in the latest build of Minecraft's Xbox Preview programme.
As spotted by Tom Warren, senior editor on The Verge, Minecraft's latest Preview version on Xbox Series X/S (currently only available to Xbox Insider members) features raytracing as a toggle-able option, giving the more-than-a-decade-old game a bit of a modern day spruce-up.

Those allegations first came to light last week as part of an investigation by People Make Games into workplace abuses at three indie studios. In that report, People Make Games' Chris Bratt spoken to Funomena staff who claimed Hunicke was emotionally abusive and often used sensitive personal information in a way that was humiliating or unprofessional, with some employees describing Hunicke as "the instigator of a huge amount of toxicity" at the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A US district court judge has confirmed they're "prepared to approve" Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard's $18m USD settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year, despite objections from other parties.
Activision Blizzard initially announced it had reached an agreement with the EEOC - to set aside $18m for employees who had experienced harassment and discrimination at the company - last September, but court approval of the settlement was delayed after California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing objected.
In that objection, the DFEH - which had filed its own bombshell lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in July last year, calling the publisher a "breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women" - claimed the settlement would cause "irreparable harm" to its own ongoing legal proceedings if approved, given that its terms would, among other things, require employees to release Activision Blizzard from claims under California state law.

Wetlands, if you haven't been keeping a tally, will be Planet Zoo's ninth DLC expansion since its launch in 2019, following on from the Arctic Pack, South America Pack, Australia Pack, Aquatic Pack, Southeast Asia Animal Pack, Africa Pack, North America Animal Pack, and Europe Pack.
Given that this latest expansion falls into the 'Animal Pack' category, it lacks the zoo-sprucing scenery items seen in Planet Zoo's just plain-old 'Pack' packs, instead choosing to focus on a boosted number of creature additions - in this case bringing a grand total of eight new water-themed species: the capybara, platypus, Asian small-clawed otter, spectacled caiman, Nile lechwe, wild water buffalo, red-crowned crane, and Danube crested newt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Witch Beam's "zen" puzzler Unpacking - which, you may recall, was named Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2021 - will be making its way to PlayStation 4 and PS5 "soon".
Unpacking initially burst out of its box toward the end of last year, giving PC, Switch, and Xbox players the opportunity to experience significant moments in the life of its protagonist, as relayed entirely through the act of pulling her current possessions out of boxes and packing them away into a new living space each time.
"Here's a puzzle game, at surface, about tidying things away," wrote Martin Robinson on announcing Unpacking as Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2021, "a premise that's compelling enough alone. There's something soothing about the fundamentals of neatly folding away t-shirts and socks while proudly stacking books on once empty shelves."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With April inching ever closer, Microsoft has hoisted its Games With Gold sack once more, upending it to reveal a fresh selection of titles being made available as part of Xbox Live Gold (and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate) subscriptions next month, which this time look an awful lot like Hue, Another Sight, Outpost Kaloki X, and MX vs ATV Alive.
Hue, if you're unfamiliar, is puzzle adventure that sees players wandering a grey world and using their colour-based powers to push ever forward. Puzzles are largely built around the ability to change the background colour of the world, either causing previously invisible objects to be made visible or to colour-match obstacles so they disappear. Developer Fiddlesticks Games expands on that premise to deliver an experience that's as sweet as it is clever - and Xbox Live Gold subscribers can grab it as part of Games With Gold from 16th April to 15th May.
As for Another Sight, it's a "surreal fantasy adventure" with another distinctive mechanic at its core. Here, players take on the role of a partially sighted girl named Kit and her cat Hodge, flipping between the two and using their respective abilities to solve puzzles and progress - Hodge being smaller, more agile and able to view much more of the environment on-screen, and Kit being more attuned to noises around her and able to manipulate larger objects. It's available on Games With Gold from 1st-30th April.

For now, the powerup system is just the Hunter's pistol (which still looks great), but Walther has promised they'll "create a proper roulette selection" when they get multiple powerups in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insomniac Games' Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart was a huge success for the company and the PlayStation 5. This is thanks to many things, but one stand out aspect of the game is undoubtedly Rivet, a fellow Lombax and all round awesome addition to the series. However, when workshopping ideas for Rivet, the team had a variety of names for her including... Ratchet. 
Chatting at GDC (via IGN), Insomniac lead designer Mark Stuart said: "For a while we switched to her just being named Ratchet. After all, she and Ratchet are technically dimensional counterparts. Ratchet is a non-gendered name."
However, this soon made the game very confusing, so this idea was ultimately scrapped. "For example: 'Ratchet needs to rescue Clank from Ratchet, who doesn't trust Ratchet and has a long history battling Nefarious,'" explained Staurt.

"Those kinds of things we're looking at in terms of fine-tuning the frequency, making sure that it's not to the point where it feels overwhelming, but we want to make sure it's timed nicely," said Mitsuno.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In response to last week's incident in which Destiny videos by prominent content creators on YouTube were hit with a spate of false copyright takedowns, developer Bungie has filed a lawsuit against ten unnamed individuals it believes responsible.
At the time of the incident, Bungie - whose own YouTube content was impacted by the bogus copyright claims - insisted the takedowns were not the result of a request by either itself or its partners. The studio later revealed the takedowns had come from "fraudulent accounts created to impersonate our IP protection service", which it believed may have been retaliation for a "recent set of authentic takedowns of OST uploads".
Following the results of its initial investigation, Bungie has now (thanks TorrentFreak) launched legal action against ten unnamed individuals, who it admits it does not yet know the identity of, but says it will "discover...soon, via subpoena or otherwise". However, while those individuals - and the "nearly incalculable damage" their actions caused - are the focus of the lawsuit, it also has more than a few choice words for Google, extensively highlighting the flaws in what it calls the "gaping security loophole" of YouTube's "easily-gamed" DMCA-process security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Friday marked the ninth anniversary of free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe, and developer Digital Extremes has now donned its jaunty party hat in order to celebrate the not-insignificant milestone with a birthday freebie and five weeks of premium rewards.
On the freebie front, players will receive the Wisp Dex Skin - the same one used in Warframe's 9th anniversary art below - via an Inbox Message in their Orbiter upon logging into the game for a limited time. In addition to that, Digital Extremes has prepared five weeks of premium Anniversary Rewards - including Skins, Weapon Slots, and Noggles (basically, bobbleheads for your Orbiter) - which can be earned by completing weekly in-game Alerts.
Rounding out each week of rewards are special Weekend Booster events - enabling players to earn Double Affinity, Double Credits, or both, depending on the weekend in question - and the full list of Alert Rewards and Weekend Boosters can be found below. Illustrative images for the rewards, incidentally, are available on the Warframe anniversary website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Friday marked the ninth anniversary of free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe, and developer Digital Extremes has now donned its jaunty party hat in order to celebrate the not-insignificant milestone with a birthday freebie and five weeks of premium rewards.
On the freebie front, players will receive the Wisp Dex Skin - the same one used in Warframe's 9th anniversary art below - via an Inbox Message in their Orbiter upon logging into the game for a limited time. In addition to that, Digital Extremes has prepared five weeks of premium Anniversary Rewards - including Skins, Weapon Slots, and Noggles (basically, bobbleheads for your Orbiter) - which can be earned by completing weekly in-game Alerts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has unveiled One Piece Odyssey, a new RPG adaptation of the hugely popular anime and manga series, which will feature a brand-new story - plus new character and monster designs - from creator Eiichiro Oda when it comes to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC later this year.
One Piece Odyssey unfolds on a mysterious island - which the Straw Hats pirate gang discover after their ship is caught in a storm - with Bandai Namco promising dungeons, quests, "wonders of a raging nature, powerful enemies, and strange encounters with island locals".
Odyssey's announcement trailer doesn't reveal much beyond an apparent exploration focus for the "epic drama adventure", but Bandai Namco notes players won't just take control of series protagonist Monkey D. Luffy as the new adventure unfolds; they'll also be able to play as other familiar faces, including Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Frankie, and Brook.

Sons of the Forest is the sequel to Endnight's The Forest, and promises plenty more unnerving gameplay for survival-horror fans.

The lucky souls who managed to snag an early Steam Deck pre-order have had their units for a few weeks now, and consequently, Valve would like to know how they're finding it, particularly if you're playing games that have been marked as "verified" - that is, games that had been tested and deemed to run smoothly and without glitches or bugs. 
"The initial data we're gathering in this way is about titles that are Steam Deck Verified," Valve explains. "We're able to collect objective data (crashes, etc.) to help us understand how well the technical side of our review process is working, but ultimately the Deck compatibility ratings are about the overall experience: the definition of 'working well' is succeeding at enabling current and future Deck customers to find the experiences they want.

As for what's coming up? Though succinct, the roadmap divides its plans into the categories "world", "ingame", and "outgame". In the next few weeks, we should get a Sanhok rollback - it's coming back "in its original form" - weapon balancing, and unspecified quality of life improvements that "reduce inconvenience without affecting core gameplay". There's a new gun, too - the new 7.62mm assault rifle that has a lower DPS than other ARs but is easier to control.

While it remains to be seen how many of those viewers will stick about after their one month trial expires - Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers were given a month free to celebrate the show's launch - Deadline reports that the show has "set a new record as the service's most-watched series premiere globally in its first 24 hours". 
No hard numbers have been offered to back up Paramount+'s claim, but Deadline points out that if true, this means Halo exceeds the previous record set by Yellowstone prequel 1883, which drew 4.9 million viewers. We should know more when the US' Nielsen Top 10 streaming rankings releases later this week which, up until now, has never featured a Paramount+ original show.

Like other such collaborations, this one doesn't come cheap - you'll need $225 (£170) even before you factor in shipping and customs charges - and just to make them even more sought-after, only 117 pairs will be made and sold, so expect a scrum on launch day.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The retreating ice cover of the Central Arctic Ocean (CAO) fuels speculations on future fisheries. However, very little is known about the existence of harvestable fish stocks in this 3.3 million­–square kilometer ecosystem around the North Pole. Crossing the Eurasian Basin, we documented an uninterrupted 3170-kilometer-long deep scattering layer (DSL) with zooplankton and small fish in the Atlantic water layer at 100- to 500-meter depth. Diel vertical migration of this central Arctic DSL was lacking most of the year when daily light variation was absent. Unexpectedly, the DSL also contained low abundances of Atlantic cod, along with lanternfish, armhook squid, and Arctic endemic ice cod. The Atlantic cod originated from Norwegian spawning grounds and had lived in Arctic water temperature for up to 6 years. The potential fish abundance was far below commercially sustainable levels and is expected to remain so because of the low productivity of the CAO...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>
